On Wednesday, diplomats William Taylor and George Kent will testify in open hearings, followed by former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch on Friday. And as House Democrats begin to present the evidence they’ve gathered in a series of televised hearings, they face the difficult task of persuading a deeply divided country that President Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine amounts to an impeachable offense.
According to FiveThirtyEight’s impeachment polling tracker, Americans are narrowly split on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office — as of publication, 47.2 percent are in favor and 45.0 percent are against. (Support for beginning the impeachment process is a little higher, at 51 percent.)
As you can see in the chart above, Democrats seem to have already picked off most of the persuadable voters when it comes to impeachment support, too. The share of Americans who think Trump should be impeached and removed has been essentially unchanged since mid-October. So how much can the Democrats’ public hearings be reasonably expected to shift the needle?
In the past, congressional hearings have been a powerful weapon. When control of the government is divided between two parties, investigations have been a vehicle for the House majority to publicly and repeatedly hammer the president. And research has found that the cumulative toll of hearings has been effective in weakening presidents, particularly as it pertains to their approval rating, so a blitz of hearings outlining the case against Trump could harm him. But then again, Trump has proven surprisingly resilient in the face of House Democrats’ investigations so far — although his approval rating is hovering around its lower bound at 41.3 percent, it hasn’t yet dipped below 40 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight’s tracker of presidential approval. There’s reason to believe that could continue even after the impeachment process goes public.
Congressional investigations can hurt presidents’ approval ratings — but not always
In the past, the relentless negative attention generated by hearings and investigations was a fairly effective way to undermine the president — or at least that’s what political scientists Eric Schickler and Douglas Kriner have found in their analysis of data on congressional hearings held between 1953 and 2014. In their book on congressional investigations, they found that when the party controlling the House was not the president’s party, there were on average 37 more investigative days, and those hearings systematically lowered presidential approval ratings.1
And when Kriner and Schickler modeled the relationship between presidential approval ratings and investigative activity, they found that more days of hearings dragged down a president’s approval rating. For instance, a month with 20 days of investigative hearings caused an approximately 2.5-percentage point drop in presidential approval; for a month with 40 investigative hearing days, presidential approval fell by around 4 points.2 (This was after even controlling for external factors that may affect views of the president, like the state of the economy. They also accounted for the effect that presidential approval can have on Congress’s willingness to investigate to begin with.)

The lesson here for Democrats is that investigations that unfold over weeks or months, rather than days, have historically damaged the president. Kriner and Schickler didn’t try to isolate the specific impact of hearings related to impeachment (although they were included in the dataset), but in an interview, they pointed out that President Nixon’s approval rating fell significantly in the summer of 1973, when the Senate Watergate Committee held weeks of public hearings on Nixon’s ties to the Watergate burglary and cover-up, which 71 percent of Americans watched live.
But the impeachment process is especially complex, and it hasn’t always negatively impacted the president. President Clinton’s approval rating remained high throughout his impeachment, never dipping below 60 percent. House Republicans only held four hearings during the entire process, though, so it’s hard to say what would have happened if they had conducted a longer, independent investigation.
Previous public hearings haven’t appeared to weaken Trump 
Of course, this isn’t the first investigation of Trump House Democrats have launched. Democrats reopened the House investigation of Russian interference into the 2016 election soon after taking control of the chamber, and in connection with this and other investigations of the president, secured high-profile, public testimony from former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and special counsel Robert Mueller — yet neither appeared to substantially change opinions of Trump or of impeachment. So it’s entirely possible that the public impeachment hearings won’t have a big effect on either support for impeachment or Trump’s approval ratings.
One theory for why Trump’s approval ratings might be unusually resilient in the face of investigations is that it’s already quite low and is also incredibly steady. Past presidents’ favorability has tended to fluctuate in response to news events, but starting with President Obama, voters’ views about the president’s job performance have been much less variable. “We may be in a world where there’s a core of Americans who will continue to support the president no matter what’s revealed about him,” Schickler said.
And Democrats’ time crunch could limit the impact as well. They’ve already scheduled three hearings, but it’s unclear how many more days of open testimony they’ll be able to get on the calendar before public phase wraps up.
The impeachment hearings could have a bigger impact, but it will still be an uphill climb
One big difference between the upcoming impeachment hearings and Democrats’ previous investigations of Trump is the number of people who are willing to testify publicly. Before the Ukraine allegations broke, Democrats struggled to secure testimony from people who could shed light on what was happening in the Trump administration. And although the Trump administration has refused to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, a number of bureaucrats and diplomats have appeared for closed-door depositions anyway, and will now be testifying publicly. The televised hearings will likely unfold over several weeks and will be closely covered by the media, which are both promising signs for Democrats. “The cumulative weight of the hearings and the coverage is exactly the kind of thing that can lead to approval ratings being dragged down,” Schickler said.
But that doesn’t mean that the hearings will lead to a huge shift in people’s views. Kriner said it might be easier to nudge people in favor of impeachment than to erode Trump’s approval ratings, since disapproval of Trump currently appears more entrenched than support for impeachment. But the fact that some of the biggest bombshells to come out of the investigation are already public — like European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland’s recent confirmation that military aid to Ukraine was contingent on the country announcing a probe of the Bidens — might dampen the effect of the hearings. It could potentially even result in a situation similar to the Russia investigation, where many of the most dramatic details in Mueller’s final report were already made public through court documents and reporting.
“There are advantages to having dramatic moments where unexpected things are said,” Kriner said. But because a lot of the facts are already known, he added, a big swing in opinion seemed unlikely: “[F]rankly it’s just very hard to know what would change the minds of the people who are still on Trump’s side.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

58 percent of voters in NYC
Running for president may increase a candidate’s profile across the country, but FiveThirtyEight’s Nathaniel Rakich shows how it can hurt your popularity at home. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris have all suffered significant drops in their approval ratings in Massachusetts, New Jersey and California, respectively, since they entered the 2020 campaign. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, however, saw the largest drop in popularity among local voters after running for president — his unfavorable rating jumped from 50 percent to 58 percent, and his net favorable rating fell from -6 percentage points to -25 points.

20 percent
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) For many men, denim is an everyday staple of their wardrobe. When the setting calls for a business casual approach, the denim you choose should have that premium look without sacrificing comfort. These jeans are made from an incredibly smooth Mercer twill denim featuring a 20 percent stretch factor. They come in a variety of fits, washes and colors — including blue hues, khaki colors and a new Olive Green — making them an ideal choice for business casual events or for everyday wear.
¥268 billion in “Singles Day” sales
Black Friday and Prime Day may be the most popular shopping days in the United States, but Alibaba’s “Singles Day” dwarfs both of them; it boasted more than 268 billion yuan ($38.3 billion) in purchases during this year’s 24-hour event. It was a new record for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., with customers buying everything from pricey electronics to mangoes from Uganda. The day’s final sales total is closely watched by investors as an indicator of economic growth and Chinese spending. Also, American superstar Taylor Swift and Asian pop icon G.E.M. both performed at the Alibaba’s Global Shopping Festival entertainment revue. [Yahoo Finance]
300 weather records
If you live on the East Coast, it’s officially time to dig out your winter gear. The National Weather Service is predicting that the next several days will feature more than 300 record-breaking (or record-equaling) cold temperatures. Two thirds of the country will experience an “Arctic blast” that will move from the Great Plains on Monday to the eastern U.S. on Tuesday and Wednesday. CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said more than 70 million people could see accumulating snow this week. [CNN]
97 bushfires
New South Wales is thousands of miles away from California, but the Australian state is facing its own fire crisis due to strong winds and high temperatures. Late on Tuesday, there were 97 fires burning across the eastern Australian state, many of them uncontained, and more than 600 schools had been closed. Officials from the Rural Fire Service advised residents to “remain vigilant.” [Sydney Morning Herald]
500 Hearst employees
On Monday, staff at Hearst announced that they are forming a union with the Writers Guild of America East. The company is one of the country’s oldest major magazine publishers — behind well-known names like Esquire, Cosmopolitan and Elle — and the unionization effort includes a variety of employees across 24 titles. According to The Daily Beast, the announcement came after more than a year of organizing behind the scenes, resulting in “the vast majority” of the company’s 500-plus editorial staff signing cards that pledged support for the unionization effort.

Tulsi Gabbard has spent most of the 2020 presidential campaign on the periphery, attracting low levels of support. But she’s also managed to develop a bit of a cult following as an outsider candidate who has sparred with the Democratic establishment and been critical of the use of American power abroad. Her unorthodox views and conflict with the party have even fueled speculation that she might run as a third-party candidate — a claim Gabbard has repeatedly denied.
However, one thing is clear: Gabbard doesn’t seem to be planning to drop out any time soon. In late October, she announced that she would not seek reelection to her seat in Hawaii, and while she’s by no means a front-runner in the race, she has managed to qualify for the November debate and is just one poll shy from making the December debate after Quinnipiac University released a New Hampshire survey on Monday that found her at 6 percent. So here’s a look at what Gabbard’s support looks like, and how that can help us make sense of her unusual candidacy.
For starters, despite her upstart campaign, Gabbard doesn’t have a ton of supporters: She’s averaging 1 to 2 percent in national surveys and 2 to 4 percent in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. But she’s managed to meet the higher polling thresholds for debate qualification, so her support has grown at least a little bit — and what’s more, a chunk of it seems to be exclusively considering backing Gabbard. Back in October FiveThirtyEight partnered with Ipsos to dig into candidate support before and after the fourth Democratic debate. Our survey found that 13 percent of Gabbard’s supporters said they were only considering voting for her, a larger share than all Democratic candidates other than former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, both of whom have more support overall.

*Only considering one candidate
From a survey of 1,761 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed from Oct. 15 to Oct. 16.
So what do we know about Gabbard’s base? For one thing, it’s overwhelmingly male — in The Economist’s national polling average, her support among men is in the mid-single digits, while her support among women is practically nonexistent.

							This trend is evident in other recent polls as well. Last week’s Quinnipiac poll of Iowa found Gabbard at 5 percent among men and 1 percent among women, and Quinnipiac’s new survey of New Hampshire found her at 9 percent among men and 4 percent among women. A late October national poll from Suffolk University found her at 6 percent among men and 2 percent among women.
Her predominantly male support shows up in other ways, too. An analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics found that only 24 percent of Gabbard’s itemized contributions had come from female donors,1 the smallest percentage of any candidate in the race. And while she doesn’t lead on the prediction markets, which tend to skew heavily young and male, as of publication, bettors do give her a slightly better chance of winning the Democratic nomination than Sen. Kamala Harris on PredictIt, though still not better than internet favorite Andrew Yang.
Gabbard’s supporters are also likely to fall outside of traditional Democratic circles. Her supporters, for instance, are more likely to have backed President Trump in 2016, hold conservative views or identify as Republican compared to voters backing the other candidates. An early November poll from The Economist/YouGov found that 24 percent of Democratic primary voters who voted for Trump in 2016 backed Gabbard. By comparison, 12 percent of these voters backed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 11 percent backed Biden and 10 percent backed Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Primary voters who identified as conservative also overwhelmingly backed Gabbard in that poll (16 percent) — only Biden and Harris enjoyed more support from this group (27 percent and 17 percent, respectively).

And a University of New Hampshire/CNN survey in late October found Gabbard actually ahead of Biden among Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire who identified as Republican, at 28 percent to Biden’s 18 percent. To be sure, the number of conservative, Republican and/or Trump voters in these polls was not large, but considering Gabbard doesn’t get that much backing to begin with — 3 percent in The Economist’s poll and 5 percent in the University of New Hampshire’s — these voters do make up a significant chunk of her support.
Quinnipiac’s New Hampshire survey also signaled Gabbard might have success among independent voters in the Democratic primary, a group that boosted Sanders in the 2016 race. In that poll, 10 percent of registered independents backed Gabbard versus just 1 percent of registered Democrats. That could be significant for Gabbard, because independents are allowed to vote in the New Hampshire primary (registered Republicans are not). Quinnipiac didn’t separate out conservatives from moderates in its ideology crosstabs, but once again less liberal voters were also more inclined to support Gabbard: 9 percent of moderate or conservative voters said they supported Gabbard as opposed to 2 percent of both somewhat liberal and very liberal voters.
In fact, Gabbard has become a bit of a conservative media darling in the primary, with conservative commentators like Ann Coulter and pro-Trump social media personalities like Mike Cernovich complimenting her for her foreign policy views. In a primary in which some 2020 Democratic contenders have boycotted Fox News, Gabbard has regularly appeared on the network. Just last week, Gabbard even did an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, a far-right political outlet. She’s also made appeals outside the political mainstream by going on The Joe Rogan Experience — one of the most popular podcasts in the country and a favored outlet for members of the Intellectual Dark Web, whose purveyors don’t fit neatly into political camps but generally criticize concepts such as political correctness and identity politics.
The nontraditional nature of Gabbard’s support, plus the criticism she’s gotten from Democrats like Hillary Clinton — who has gone as far as to suggest that the Republicans are “grooming” Gabbard, a “favorite of the Russians,” as a spoiler candidate — has certainly helped fuel the idea that Gabbard might run as a third-party candidate. Gabbard has denied it so far, although it is hard to believe her strategy is a winning one in the Democratic primary. While loyal, her base of support just isn’t that big, meaning she needs to make serious inroads with more traditional Democratic constituencies. On the one hand, her back and forth with Clinton may have given her a boost in recent weeks, so battling the party establishment could be a useful strategy. On the other hand, garnering approval from conservative media isn’t likely to improve her poor favorability among Democrats or attract the support she needs to win the primary, no matter how loyal her base is.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-polls-say-about-impeachment-before-the-first-public-hearing/,2019-11-12,,,features,"Nov. 12, 2019",What The Polls Say About Impeachment Before The First Public Hearing,Laura Bronner,FiveThirtyEight,Impeachment,"On Wednesday, we enter a new phase of the House’s impeachment investigation into President Trump: public hearings. And with this week’s testimony may come the first substantial shift in public opinion about impeachment in more than a month.
Support for impeachment first shot up in late September and early October, as news was piling up about Trump’s request that Ukraine investigate his political rival, but public opinion has leveled off. As of around noon Monday, according to our impeachment polling tracker, on average, 48.0 percent of Americans said they supported impeachment in one form or another, while 44.4 percent said they didn’t support it. That’s not too different from the 49.3 percent who supported impeachment and 43.5 percent who opposed it a month earlier.
In fact, even when you break impeachment polls into categories based on question wording — specifically, those that asked if people supported beginning the impeachment process, those that asked if people supported actual impeachment, and those that asked if people supported impeachment and removal — a similar picture emerges: Support for each “flavor” of impeachment has been pretty steady since early October. That said, support for beginning the process has consistently been noticeably higher than support for impeachment or support for impeachment and removal, the latter two of which have been very similar. As of Monday morning, 51.0 percent of Americans supported beginning the impeachment process, while 46.6 percent supported impeachment and 47.4 percent supported impeachment and removal.1
But there are some interesting variations between the categories if we isolate Democrats, Republicans and independents.
Among Democrats, for instance, support for impeachment and removal has generally run higher than support for impeachment alone. This could just be noise in the data (remember, we’re looking at crosstabs of polls now, which come with larger margins of error), but it also makes a certain amount of sense: Democrats largely want to see Trump out of the White House, so they might jump at the chance to answer “yes” to a poll that asks about removing him from office. As of Monday, the percentage of Democrats who supported impeachment and removal (84.6 percent) was closer to the percentage who supported beginning the process (85.6 percent) than to the percentage who supported impeachment alone (80.8 percent).
Among Republicans, unsurprisingly, the opposite was true. Support for impeachment and removal has consistently been the lowest of the three categories since late September, with support hitting a measly 9.3 percent on Monday, while support for impeachment alone was at 11.1 percent (although we should note that, because of polls’ margins of error, that’s not a meaningful difference). Support for beginning the impeachment process was highest, although still not that high at 13.6 percent.
Finally, among independents, the picture looks much the same as it does overall. Support for beginning the impeachment process has consistently been significantly higher than support in the other types of polls and sat at 49.5 percent on Monday. Meanwhile, support for impeaching Trump and support for impeaching and removing him have moved in tandem over the last five weeks.
Since Nov. 3, however, independents have been a bit more likely to support impeachment and removal than simple impeachment, and the numbers were 44.3 percent to 41.1 percent as of Monday. We’re not sure why this might be (again, it could just be noise), but it will be interesting to see whether that trend continues into the public hearing phase of the inquiry.
Remember, the high-profile nature of the hearings has the potential to scramble these numbers across the board — marshaling public opinion behind impeachment if the hearings contain compelling evidence against Trump, or rallying the public behind the president if voters feel that Democrats are overreaching. Only one thing is for sure: We’ll be keeping a close eye on whether the polling average on impeachment shifts meaningfully.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

You can do it as a fan, as a neutral observer, as a player stan or even as a skeptic, if your idea of fun is to look side-eyed at endless drama.
But for WNBA front offices, there’s only one way to look at the NCAA season: player evaluation time for the 2020 WNBA Draft.
The WNBA differs from the NBA in some key respects when it comes to player evaluation. For one thing, players cannot be one-and-done; a player must have played four years or turn 22 years old in the calendar year the draft is held. So players have a more significant body of work to go on when teams decide, typically at least three seasons.1
There’s also the relatively static nature of the draft order itself. The WNBA already has a draft order set, and free agency comes before the draft. Thus, teams can zero in on their preferred targets with relative certainty about the likelihood that they can draft a given player.
With that said, there’s much teams don’t know about individual players entering the college season. Even in a deep draft, the very best players have some lingering question marks. So what do the top prospects need to prove?
Sabrina Ionescu: Finishing at the rim
It’s hard to find a more pro-ready player than Ionescu. She has an elite ability to find teammates, best exhibited by her assist rate of 38.5 percent during her junior campaign. And unlike some great point guard prospects, she isn’t compiling assists at the cost of too many turnovers: She posted a 16.9 percent turnover rate her freshman year and, by last season, had cut that to 12.4 percent. Nor does she need to develop proficiency from deep, as she’s posted three straight seasons north of 40 percent from three.
But it may give WNBA talent evaluators pause when, even though defenders know they have to go get a hand up and close out on Ionescu’s 3-point attempts, she still shot just 44.7 percent from inside the arc, down from her sophomore year mark of 49 percent and decidedly mediocre for a player who will be expected to penetrate to rev the engine of the team that drafts her (like, say, the New York Liberty, who will pick first overall).
The concern with the 5-foot-11 Ionescu is whether she has that first-step quickness. Her proficiency at the rim, and from 2-point range more generally, will be the statistical answer to that question.
Lauren Cox: Usage rate
No one has much doubt that Cox, a 6-foot-4 standard-bearer for the positionless direction the WNBA is headed and an already-decorated NCAA champion for Baylor, has what it takes to be a contributor in the league. The question is one of degree, not ability. She showcased a versatile offensive skillset last season, shooting 55.5 percent from two and 30.6 percent from three — which, combined with getting to the free throw line and converting, improves the likelihood of her long-distance shooting translating to the next level. She rebounds and she blocks shots — the latter often in rarely used zone coverages, but her length and basketball IQ mean that is another skill likely to translate.
Even so, if Cox is to become a franchise centerpiece, she’ll need to score efficiently and often. Namely, her usage rate needs to go increase from 20.1 percent, 1329th in the country last season, for WNBA teams to choose her with the idea of building around her. To put it in context: A comparable player, Alanna Smith of Stanford and now the Phoenix Mercury, put up a usage rate of 30.4 percent as a senior. That wouldn’t be a bad benchmark for Cox to hit, and with former teammate Kalani Brown now in Los Angeles, Cox will be asked to do something approaching that as Baylor defends its NCAA title.
Beatrice Mompremier: Free-throw shooting
When Mompremier, Miami’s offensive fulcrum, said she wanted to return to school last season rather than enter the WNBA draft a year early, she said this: “While my dream is to play in the WNBA, I think I have a lot of improvements I can make before moving to that level, including expanding my range.”
That interesting bit of self-scouting reflects the state of the WNBA: Mompremier is 6-foot-4, but she understands that to be an elite power forward at the next level, she needs to be a threat from beyond the arc, where she made a total of one 3-pointer in her first three seasons in college.
But there’s this, too: Mompremier simply isn’t a good free-throw shooter. She gets to the line plenty, as she was 44th in Division I in attempts last year. But she made her free throws at just a 57.9 percent clip after hitting 57.8 percent of her free throws as a sophomore for Baylor in 2016-17.2 The WNBA values consistency, but not that kind of consistency.
And while there are some WNBA players who struggle a bit at the line, of the 100 players who qualified for the minutes per game leaderboard last season, no player shot below 67.2 percent from the line. In 2018, the top 100 all shot 70.6 percent or better. In a league where she can expect to spend a fair amount of time in the post, Mompremier simply has to improve her proficiency from the charity stripe.
Chennedy Carter: Assist percentage
Carter’s 34-point performance against USA Basketball on Thursday night hardly came as a surprise to those familiar with her game; her vast universe of drives, pull-ups and long-distance shots that she showed have made her an obvious next-level player since she was in high school. Her game pops off the screen and is somehow even more impressive in person.
It’s not certain that Carter will be part of the 2020 WNBA Draft – she would be entering a year early. But WNBA talent evaluators aren’t looking for whether Carter’s game or skills will translate. It is a bigger question: Can they hand Carter the keys to a team?
Texas A&M has been good, but not great, in her time in College Station, and after former teammate Anriel Howard left for Mississippi State, Carter’s assist rate dropped from 33.3 percent as a freshman to 24.6 percent as a sophomore. So just what is she at the next level?
Kelsey Mitchell at Ohio State and Jewell Loyd at Notre Dame offer a potential roadmap for Carter. Both were ball-dominant guards who got to the next level, only to see their roles remain vague for several years in the pros. In both cases, the idea was that they would get grow into running a team, but their uber-athleticism and ability to create would immediately benefit them as point guards in the league. Ultimately, though, Loyd has been best as a shooting guard, winning a title next to Sue Bird. In Indiana, Mitchell hasn’t spent a lot of time running the point, and Erica Wheeler’s emergence this season has arguably helped Mitchell find a comfort zone off the ball as well.
None of this means Carter is doomed as a WNBA player if she merely becomes Loyd or Mitchell — that’s an awfully high floor. But if she’s going to be, say, a Skylar Diggins-Smith or Chelsea Gray, she must show the WNBA that she’s ready to run a team.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

And in a related development, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick are all reportedly considering entering the race, even as they would face long odds against winning the nomination.
Can’t the party establishment just live with one of the candidates who are already running? After all, the Democratic field is getting smaller, but it’s still huge, with 16 “major” candidates.1 And the party’s voters like the candidates just fine. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in July found record-high levels of enthusiasm about the field among Democratic voters, matched only by their excitement in 2008 when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were running. A Huffpost/YouGov survey from last month found that 83 percent of Democrats were satisfied with the party’s candidates.
So … what’s going on? Why are the party pooh-bahs so nervous?
It’s difficult to provide a definitive answer to this question, in large part because “Democratic donors” and “the Democratic establishment” are large, nebulous groups. We don’t have a formal poll testing the views of the “establishment,” for example. Plus, news organizations tend to be more likely to write stories with the theme “people are worried” than “everything is fine,” so you should be somewhat skeptical of how representative these stories are of opinions overall.
That said, my own interviews and conversations with elite Democrats2 and those who have talked to other reporters do suggest that some members of the establishment are nervous. So this is view is out there, even if I can’t quite tell you how pervasive it is. But however widespread the feeling is, I don’t think it’s too difficult to understand. Here are three explanations that cropped up in my reporting, ordered from most to least important (at least in my view):
An unorthodox group of front-runners
If you are a major Democratic donor or a Democratic National Committee member, you likely were a strong supporter of at least one of the last two Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. You want to win the general election, and you’re looking for what’s worked in the past. In November 1991, Clinton was 45 years old and had served as Arkansas’s governor for more than a decade. In November 2007, Barack Obama was 46 years old and had served in the U.S. Senate for two years. Ideologically, both positioned themselves as center-left (as opposed to more openly liberal) during their campaigns.
I think if one of the candidates at the top of the polls was or had been a governor or senator, was between the ages of, roughly, 40 and 70, and was not considered either too liberal or too conservative by many in the party, then the party’s elites would not be casting about for someone else. Instead, from the point of view of these party elites, the leading contenders include …
A candidate who is charismatic and ideologically “safe,” but who’s only 37 years old and has never been elected to statewide office (Pete Buttigieg);
A candidate with lots of political experience who’s also ideologically “safe,” but who’s 76 years old (Joe Biden);
Two candidates with plenty of political experience and clear appeal, but who are far more liberal than most past nominees (Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — also, Sanders is 78 years old).
Fellow FiveThirtyEight contributor Julia Azari, a Marquette University professor, argues in an essay in the book “The Making of the Presidential Candidates 2020” that there is a deep tension right now in the Democratic Party between “risk aversion and orientation toward the status quo” on the one hand and an increasingly powerful bloc pushing for more progressive ideas on the other. That status-quo-oriented group seems to be the one looking for alternatives.
Most key figures in the Democratic Party haven’t endorsed anyone yet. But among the endorsements we do have, you can see these elite preferences in action. Cory Booker (sitting senator, 50 years old, not as left as Sanders and Warren) is right behind Warren in number of endorsements so far, and Kamala Harris (sitting senator, 55 years old, not as left as Sanders and Warren) is well ahead of Warren in endorsements. Both Booker and Harris are also leading Sanders, despite clearly trailing Warren and Sanders in the polls. If Harris and, especially, Booker (because he is a man and would therefore be considered a safer choice by some Democrats) were polling at the level Warren is, my guess is that they would be getting a flood of endorsements and lots more buzz.
In short, party establishment figures think they know what a great White House candidate looks like — and they aren’t sure they’ve seen one yet. One longtime D.C.-based Democratic operative I talked to referred to “head-scratching” among the party’s establishment, “wondering why these super-talented candidates are making some really dumb mistakes.” Those mistakes, according to this strategist, included Biden’s campaign spending more than it raised from July to September, Buttigieg’s lack of succcessful outreach to black voters, Harris’s struggles to come up with a clear message and Warren fully embracing “Medicare for All.”
Worry about Warren 
Party establishment types that I have talked to see a scenario in which Warren wins Iowa, where she is polling well, and New Hampshire, where voters are fairly familiar with the Massachusetts senator. With those two early wins, she becomes more popular, particularly with nonwhite voters, and basically sweeps to the nomination. This is basically what happened in 2004 with John Kerry and similar to what happened with Obama in 2008 (he came in a close second in New Hampshire). The party establishment types may be wrong in predicting that outcome, but they are speaking from their own recent experiences.
“If she wins Iowa, this whole thing could be over,” a DNC member told me.
And the prospect of a Warren nomination has some party insiders worried. Establishment Democrats often cast Warren as a bad general election candidate, but many of them simply don’t want her to be president — she has fairly aggressive policy plans to take on elite, wealthy Democrats (and Republicans). Bloomberg’s aides are essentially telegraphing a plan to stop Warren: If Biden struggles in the early states, the former New York mayor will enter the race on Super Tuesday, running as the moderate alternative to Warren instead of Biden.
Biden’s problems, according to the party elites I spoke with, boil down to a fear he won’t be able to stop Warren, and that he’s vulnerable largely because he is not clearly leading in Iowa or New Hampshire.
“Buttigieg, Warren and Sanders have created national movements around their candidacies; Biden absolutely has the potential to do that, but he hasn’t so far,” said Robert Zimmerman, a New Yorker who is both a longtime party donor and a DNC member.
I think Democratic elites are overly pessimistic about Biden’s candidacy. The former vice president, according to the polls, is a clear front-runner in the primary and polls well against Trump in the general election. It’s not even guaranteed that he will lose Iowa or New Hampshire, but even if he does, polling suggests Biden will still be in a strong position in Nevada and South Carolina because he does better with nonwhite voters.
But Democratic elites have never been enthralled with Biden as a potential general election candidate or president. When Biden considered a White House run in 2016, for instance, Barack Obama and his aides weren’t exactly encouraging — in fact, some of their moves bordered on discouraging. In all, Biden ran for president two times, in 1988 and 2008, and flirted with runs four other times, in 1980, 1984, 2004 and 2016. The party elite didn’t rally behind him in any of those races — and they aren’t doing so now.
Elites have basically given up on lower-tier candidates 
You might be thinking, particularly regarding the nascent Holder and Patrick campaigns, what’s wrong with Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, the two center-left black candidates already in the race? Why doesn’t the establishment just unify behind one of the people who isn’t in the top four but who already has a campaign infrastructure and would be a fairly conventional party nominee? What about Amy Klobuchar or Julián Castro?
Donors and party elites don’t see these candidates as viable, because they’re so far down in the polls. (There is a bit of a contradiction here, in that the donors are pessimistic about Biden despite his strong polling but down on the other candidates because of their weak polling.)
There have been public reports about Harris’s campaign donors, in particular, starting to think that she is no longer a viable candidate. And even as Democratic establishment types emphasize the importance of nominating an electable candidate, they are making little effort to boost Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana or Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, both of whom have won in areas where Trump was strong in 2016. (Trump won Montana and many rural counties in Minnesota that Klobuchar carried in 2018.)
“I think the problem isn’t so much that there is no one good in the field, but that it seems harder to get Harris or Booker to move to the front of the pack than it is to get an unknown to jump in and maybe immediately get attention and move to the front,” said Hans Noel, a Georgetown University professor and expert on dynamics within the two parties.
He added, “I don’t have any reporting on this, but I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Patrick or Holder had been discouraged from running because someone like Booker or Harris or Castro was already in the field. Now that they [Booker, Harris, Castro] are not at the top, it’s a chance to get in.”


So how does this end? Is someone new really going to jump into the race? If so, will his or her campaign be viable? I tend to think that a last-ditch candidacy can’t win, unless maybe we are talking about someone really popular and well-known like Michelle Obama. I don’t think someone like Patrick has much of a chance to knock off Biden or Warren, who have been campaigning for months, raised millions of dollars and have staff on the ground in key states. I can’t rule out one of these people running anyway — Bloomberg and Patrick in particular have long flirted with running for president. They want the job, so maybe they convince themselves there is a path to get it even if there really isn’t.
But, in the end, I’d bet that the party establishment will accept whomever does well in primaries in February and March. I don’t think Bloomberg himself will ever endorse Warren if she does well in those first few contests, but he represents something of an extreme case. Would, for example, former top Obama aide Valerie Jarrett endorse the Massachusetts senator if she won the first four primaries, essentially signaling that the former president is fine with Warren as the nominee? I think that’s very possible. Like the Republican Party in the 2016 primary cycle it doesn’t appear that the Democratic establishment will collectively decide who the nominee should be before the voters weigh in. But the party will likely decide at some point to get behind Biden, Buttigieg, Warren or Sanders — and this autumn angst will seem like a distant memory.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Have A Guard Set A Ball Screen.,Jared Dubin,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"Picture a pick and roll in your mind’s eye. What do you see?
If you’re of a certain age, you probably see grainy images of John Stockton working his way around a screen from Karl Malone, sizing up the defense and waiting until exactly the right moment before delivering a pinpoint pass to The Mailman. If you’re a bit younger, maybe you see Steve Nash threading the needle between multiple defenders to find a rolling Amar’e Stoudemire, who powerfully slams the ball through the rim; or perhaps Tony Parker veering away from his defender and ducking behind a Tim Duncan screen, wrong-footing his man as he pulls up for a midrange jumper. If your basketball memory doesn’t extend far beyond the past few years, maybe you see Stephen Curry luring a double-team out to half-court while Draymond Green rolls to the nail, catches a pass and coolly navigates a four-on-three opportunity.
If you’ve been playing close attention in recent seasons, however, what you’ve been seeing more of looks something like this.
		
In each of those clips, Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard receives a screen from one of Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams or Landry Shamet. Aside from being Leonard’s Clipper teammates, those players have an interesting thing in common: They’re all guards.
Through Nov. 10, 9.3 percent of all plays involving on-ball screens during the 2019-20 NBA season have been set by guards, according to Second Spectrum tracking data. While that number might not sound enormous, it’s the continuation of a trend that has seen the share of plays involving ball screens set by guards approximately double over the past six years.
Even a cursory glance at slightly more granular data offers an explanation as to why this is happening: Pick and rolls with a guard as the screener have been more efficient than those with a forward or center as the screener in five of the past six seasons.1 The difference in per-possession efficiency between pick and rolls working off of guard-set screens (1.14 points per possession) and those using forwards or centers as the screener (1.05 points per possession) has also never been wider over this period than it is right now.
Throughout NBA history, pick and rolls have almost always seen a forward or center screening for a guard, so forwards and centers, in turn, have far more experience defending screeners. Using a guard in that role can therefore put opposing guards in unfamiliar and often uncomfortable situations. Defensive players put in unfamiliar and uncomfortable situations are more likely to make mistakes, which may present the offense with better scoring opportunities.
NBA defenses have been far more willing to switch defenders on pick and rolls involving a screen set by a guard than they have those with a screen set by a forward or center.2 The switch rate on plays involving guard-set screens has ranged between 32 and 42 percent over the past six seasons, while the high-water mark for switching on plays with forward- or center-set screens during the same time period is just under 15 percent. Overall, over the past six seasons, pick and rolls where a guard sets the screen have been switched nearly 3.5 times as often (39.1 percent vs. 11.5 percent) as those that used a forward or center as the screener.
Despite that increased willingness to switch, offenses have still managed a greater level of per-possession efficiency on guard-screened pick and rolls than the more traditional kind. Why might that be the case? At first glance, nothing really stands out as the reason such plays have been more efficient. But there’s an obvious through-line here. Pick and rolls using guard-set screens over the past six seasons have resulted in turnovers slightly less often than those with forwards or centers doing the screening. Guard-screened pick and rolls have also yielded shooting fouls slightly more often than the forward- or center-screened plays. And the leaguewide shooting percentages on both 2-point and 3-point shots have been slightly better on plays where a guard sets the screen, while those plays have also yielded 3-point looks slightly more often than those where a forward or center did the screening.

None of those gaps alone can explain the observed difference in efficiency. But a bunch of small advantages stacked on top of each other will do the trick — and that appears to be what’s happening here for the guards involved in such plays.
The frequency of these plays also warrants a deeper dive into which teams and players are taking advantage of them most often. On the team level, it’s clear that the Houston Rockets are at the top of the league. No team has run more pick and rolls with a guard as the screener over the past six seasons than Houston. Of the 19 teams that have run at least 1,500 of them during that time period, none has been more efficient on a per-possession basis than the Rockets, who have scored 1.12 points per possession.
That the Rockets are at the forefront of this movement shouldn’t be surprising to anyone who closely follows the league; Daryl Morey, Mike D’Antoni and Co. orient their offense around The Math in many ways, and this is just another. Predictably, given the Rockets’ heavy usage of these plays, James Harden is among the league leaders in being screened for by guards. This season, Harden has been screened for by a guard in the pick and roll 112 times. That’s nearly as many as the next two closest players (Damian Lillard and Kyrie Irving) combined. His 12.44 guard-screened pick and rolls per game this year is on track to be the most any player has run in the past six seasons, as it would dwarf the 8.43 per game LeBron James averaged during the 2016-17 campaign.
Harden has been incredibly efficient on those plays this season — producing 1.28 points per possession, which would be the sixth-best mark among the 158 individual seasons in which a player has received at least 100 guard-set screens in the pick and roll over the past six years. Zooming out over the full sample, however, reveals who the real masters of these types of plays are. The table below shows the number of players who have run a given amount of guard-screened pick and rolls over the past six seasons as well as the points per possession leader among that group of players. There’s a familiar name among the high-volume orchestrators.

LeBron James sitting atop this list seems quite appropriate. It could be argued that the Cavaliers’ relentless targeting of Curry during the 2016 NBA Finals — with J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova repeatedly screening for James in order to involve Curry in the action — led to the subsequent spike we’ve seen in these types of plays. We saw the Rockets pursue the same strategy during their playoff series against the Warriors last season, and we saw Golden State’s opponents target Curry with seven screens in 3.5 games this season before he broke his wrist.
Given how well these plays seem to work, we shouldn’t expect that teams will stop running them anytime soon. If anything, we should get ready to see more and more guards setting screens in the pick and roll, until opposing defenses figure out a better way to stop it.

Candidate Qualifies For The November Debate,Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"The clock is ticking for Democratic presidential contenders hoping to make the fifth debate on Nov. 20— just six days left to qualify — and the sixth debate on Dec. 19. And a new survey of the Iowa caucusgoers by Quinnipiac University has given two candidates the final qualifying poll they need. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard got 3 percent support in the new poll, which qualifies her for the November debate, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar earned 5 percent, putting her on the December stage. By our count, this means 10 candidates have now made the fifth debate and six have qualified for the sixth, so let’s check in to see where things stand for the other candidates.
First up, the November debate. It looks as if Gabbard might be the last candidate to qualify by the Nov. 13 deadline. Of the six other “major” candidates1 who haven’t yet qualified but are still in the race, not one has a single qualifying poll. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro has met the donor threshold, but he’s had no such luck in the polling department, so watch out — Castro might drop out soon, as he has said it will be “the end of my campaign” if he doesn’t make the stage.

*For candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight.
To qualify for the fifth debate, a candidate must reach 3 percent support in at least four national or early-state polls or 5 percent support in at least two early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations. Candidates must also have at least 165,000 unique donors, including at least 600 donors in at least 20 states or territories. We rely on self-reported figures from the campaigns for candidates’ fundraising numbers, and we’ve assumed that candidates who have reported having at least 165,000 donors also have at least 600 donors in 20 states or territories.

(As a reminder, making the November debate requires candidates to have four surveys of at least 3 percent support in national or early-state polls, or at least 5 percent support in two polls from the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.2 They also need contributions from 165,000 unique donors — including at least 600 individual donors in at least 20 states or territories.)3
So with the stage likely set for November, the December debate moves into the spotlight. The sixth debate qualifying thresholds are tougher: Candidates must earn 4 percent support in four national or early-state surveys, or 6 percent support in two early-state polls,4 as well as contributions from 200,000 unique donors (including at least 800 donors in at least 20 states or territories). Klobuchar is now the sixth candidate to hit this mark (since we last checked in, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, got his fourth qualifying poll on Oct. 29 and Sen. Kamala Harris got hers on Nov. 3).

The December debate qualification period ends on Dec. 12, so the number of candidates on the stage could still grow. And of the short list, the four who’ve made the November debate but haven’t yet qualified for December are the likeliest to make it, although securing a spot in the lineup is hardly guaranteed.
Of that quartet, only tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang has cleared the donor threshold (though it seems probable that Gabbard, billionaire activist Tom Steyer and Sen. Cory Booker can also attract 200,000 unique donors by the deadline). Getting enough qualifying polls, on the other hand, will be challenging. So far, Gabbard and Steyer are closest with two surveys each, while Yang has one to his name. Booker is in real trouble, though. He hasn’t hit 4 percent in a single debate-qualifying poll since late August, so reaching that threshold in four surveys will likely be difficult. But for Booker and the others still short of qualifying for December, their showing in November could give them the boost they need — or, then again, it could be all she wrote.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Over the course of this election cycle so far, 25 major presidential candidates1 — by FiveThirtyEight’s definition — have entered the race for the Democratic nomination. That gobsmacking number sparked criticism that there were perverse incentives to run for president even if a candidate plainly had no shot at winning — namely, that the exposure from a national run would help them sell books or land them a cable-news gig. But as 2019 has worn on, it’s become clear that running for president to raise one’s national profile isn’t without its risks. Some candidates have suffered adverse effects from their presidential runs: It’s hurt their political standing back home.
I dug up as many polls as I could find of the 2020 presidential candidates’ popularity — not nationally or among Democratic primary voters, but among all respondents in their home jurisdiction (the state, district or city that they represent2). Then I looked for polls conducted shortly before they announced their presidential campaign and compared the before and after pictures. What I found was that almost everyone has seen their net popularity decline, although some candidates have suffered more damage than others.
Take, for example, Sen. Kamala Harris. In a September 2018 poll by the Public Policy Institute of California, 44 percent of adults approved of Harris’s job performance, while only 27 percent disapproved — a net approval rating of +17 points. One year later, however (and after Harris had been on the national campaign trail for nine months), 40 percent of adults approved of her job performance, while 37 percent disapproved — a net approval rating of only +3 points. At least two other pollsters, Morning Consult and Quinnipiac University, also show that Harris’s net approval rating at home has dropped over the past several months.
Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren may be winning the hearts of Democratic primary voters nationwide, but she is losing support among her own constituents in Massachusetts. In May 2018, a WBUR/MassINC poll found that Massachusetts voters had a favorable impression of Warren, 53 percent to 33 percent. But by October of this year, her favorable rating was 48 percent and her unfavorable rating was 35 percent. Morning Consult’s recurring poll also found the same 7-point drop in her net job approval rating since she started running for president.
It’s the same story with former 2020 candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. According to the Siena Research Institute, her net favorability rating (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) in New York has declined from +17 in January to +5 in September. And Morning Consult has observed a 7-point drop in her net approval rating since late 2018.
In fact, this may help explain why Gillibrand dropped out so early. Hyped as a presidential candidate for years and possessing a sizable financial war chest, Gillibrand was not running a vanity campaign — she appeared in it to win it. But when it became clear that her campaign was not getting any traction, it probably made sense for her to drop out early and rebuild her relationships at home; at age 52, she still has a long political future.
Sen. Cory Booker may be approaching this point as well. According to Monmouth University polling, in April 2018, 54 percent of New Jersey voters approved of his job performance and 31 percent disapproved; in September 2019, though, only 45 percent approved and 40 percent disapproved. Unlike California, Massachusetts and New York, New Jersey is not so blue that any Democratic nominee can be considered a sure bet to win a Senate race, so Booker’s presidential run could prove to be a real liability to his reelection campaign if his approval continues to fall. (Unlike Harris, Warren and Gillibrand, Booker is also up for reelection in 2020.) That said, Morning Consult, the only other pollster I found that asked about Booker in New Jersey this year, finds that his net approval has declined less precipitously — from +14 in the last three months of 2018 to +10 in July-September 2019.
Indeed, according to Morning Consult, which conducts quarterly polls of every senator’s and governor’s approval ratings, not every 2020 candidate has stirred discontent back home. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who dropped out in August, did not overstay his welcome in the race, and his image has largely remained intact; he sports the same +12 net job approval rating now as he did in late 2018. Morning Consult also pegs Sen. Bernie Sanders as the most popular senator in the country among each senator’s own constituents, in terms of raw approval rating. It would seem that his presidential ambitions haven’t bothered Vermonters, as his +35 net approval rating is only 1 point worse than it was before he launched his campaign.
On the other hand, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Sen. Michael Bennet and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock may have tarnished their images somewhat, though not too much, by running for president; per Morning Consult, their net approval ratings3 each fell by 4 points. And while Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s net approval rating took an 8-point hit in Minnesota, she remains extremely popular overall; she went from a 58 percent approval and 27 percent disapproval to 55 approval, 32 disapproval (still very impressive in a purple state like Minnesota).
Finally, no one ended their presidential campaign in a worse position at home than New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. According to the Siena Research Institute, in April 2019, a few weeks before launching his presidential campaign, 44 percent of voters in New York City had a favorable opinion of de Blasio, while 50 percent had an unfavorable opinion. But that somehow got even worse after he jumped into the race. In Siena’s September poll, de Blasio’s favorable rating in New York City was down to 33 percent, and his unfavorable rating was up to 58 percent. It’s little wonder that he pulled the plug on his campaign shortly thereafter.
One of the 25 (now 16) major candidates in the Democratic primary will (most likely) earn a place in history as the party’s nominee — and perhaps the 46th president of the United States. But the others will go limping home, and many will resume their prior political careers. As this data shows, most of them will be now worse off with their home constituencies. Running for president may carry the possibility of national fame (not to mention national office), but we ought to remember that there are real pitfalls to it as well — and one of the big ones is squandering your existing political career if you fail.

20 French bakery closures
A baguette may be as classically French as the Eiffel Tower, but many rural communities are losing their bakeries, as well as fewer young people enter the profession or eat bread. The New York Times reports the coastal department of Manche, for example, expects 20 more bakeries to close in the next year, on top of the 50 that have closed over the past decade. Some customers now get their bread from vending machines, but lament the loss of bakeries as local meeting points. [New York Times]
30 years in prison
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has sentenced Bosco Ntaganda to 30 years in prison after finding him guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity for offenses committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002 and 2003. Charges against the former Congolese rebel leader include murder, rape, enlisting child soldiers, pillage and intentionally directing attacks against civilians. The prison sentence sets two records — it is the longest handed down by the ICC, and Ntaganda is the first person to be convicted of sexual slavery. [CNN]
1,688 high-hazard dams
An investigation from the Associated Press has identified 1,688 high-hazard dams in poor or worse condition in locations that pose serious risk to homes, businesses, highways or even entire communities if the dams fail. The report notes that there is a strong likelihood that the actual number is much higher, after several states declined to provide condition ratings for their dams or didn’t rate all of them “due to lack of funding, staffing or authority to do so.” The federal data and reports came from 44 states and Puerto Rico. [Associated Press]
28 days
Only four weeks after Atatiana Jefferson was fatally shot in her home by a police officer, her father died of a heart attack at the age of 58. Marquis Jefferson passed away on Saturday at the Methodist Charlton Medical Center in Dallas, and a spokesperson for the family told the Washington Post that the death of his 28-year-old daughter had deeply affected Marquis’ health. “I didn’t know what a broken heart meant, but I feel like I’ve really witnessed a broken heart,” the spokesperson said.

35 Olympic swimming pools of radioactive matter
The legacy of the U.S.’s Cold War-era atomic testing program is still affecting the Marshall Islands at the Runit Dome, which holds more than 3.1 million cubic feet of U.S.-produced radioactive soil and debris, as well as lethal amounts of plutonium. An investigation between the Los Angeles Times and Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism reports that the dome is now at significant risk of collapsing from the effects of climate change. American officials have declined to help address the problem, but the news report says the U.S. government withheld important information about the contents of Runit and its weapons testing program, including the fact that 130 tons of soil from atomic testing grounds was shipped from Nevada to the Marshall Islands in 1958. [Los Angeles Times]
32 police officers
A coalition of news organizations across California have found 32 officers who were accused of committing domestic violence that were able to plead down to nonviolent misdemeanors, allowing them to keep their guns and stay on the job. These softer charges included disturbing the peace, vandalism and unreasonable noise, despite evidence of black eyes, bloody marks on limbs, as well as one spouse being knocked unconscious. Reporters uncovered a total of 84 cases of law enforcement officers that were convicted in connection with a domestic-abuse charge in the past decade, but also noted that state records on criminal conduct among police are “too flawed to illustrate the true scope of the problem.” [The Mercury News]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/jeff-sessions-might-struggle-to-win-back-his-old-senate-seat/,2019-11-11,,,features,"Nov. 11, 2019",Jeff Sessions Might Struggle To Win Back His Old Senate Seat,Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Senate Elections,"Last week, Jeff Sessions announced that he’s running for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, the same seat he held for 20 years before resigning to become U.S. Attorney General in 2017. But although Sen. Doug Jones is the most vulnerable Democrat up in 2020, and Sessions has had a long, successful history with the Alabama GOP, he’s far from a shoo-in for 2020.
At first blush, you might expect Sessions to get a warm welcome from Alabama Republicans. After all, he was well-liked in his Senate days — his net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating) in 2016 was nearly 30 points, according to Morning Consult. And he was reelected three times to the chamber, and each time by crushing margins — even going unopposed in 2014 — before he resigned to join Trump’s Cabinet in 2017. So in theory, Sessions could swoop in and become the leading Republican contender by way of his outsized political profile, as there isn’t a clear front-runner yet. There’s just one problem: President Trump.
Trump is still angry at Sessions because when he was his attorney general, Sessions recused himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, leaving Trump without an attorney general to defend him. So Trump’s disdain for Sessions could undermine his bid, as the president remains very popular in Alabama. In fact, Trump had a +22 net approval rating there in September, the president’s highest mark in any state, according to Morning Consult. What’s more, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has expressed concern about Sessions’s bid. That’s because a chaotic primary could potentially hurt the party’s chances of winning a seat the GOP should be favored to win back in strongly Republican Alabama.
So far, we only have one primary poll to go on that includes Sessions, but it provides some positive news for him, albeit from a friendly source. The Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group that pushed for Sessions to run, released a survey that found Sessions leading the Republican field with 36 percent of Republican primary voters supporting him, ahead of former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville’s 23 percent, while Rep. Bradley Byrne and former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court Roy Moore (who lost the 2017 special election to Jones) each had 11 percent. And although he led that poll, Sessions’s support would still be insufficient to avoid a primary runoff, as Alabama is one of seven states that requires a candidate to win a majority of the vote in order to capture the nomination. The runoff system could be a real problem for Sessions, too. While Sessions might garner the most votes in the primary — good enough to win in most states — Trump could end up endorsing his opponent in the runoff, making it tougher for Sessions to attract enough additional support to win a majority.
And other leading Republican candidates don’t appear likely to make way for Sessions’s entrance into the race. Just before Sessions announced, Tuberville said that Sessions “had a chance to help President Trump, and he failed him once.” “We don’t need him to fail him again,” he added. A pro-Tuberville political action committee is also running an ad calling Sessions a “traitor” to Trump. Meanwhile, Byrne said it would be tough for Sessions to win with Trump calling him “an embarrassment to the great state of Alabama.”
No Republican has Trump’s endorsement yet, but it’s pretty clear that Sessions’s opponents are angling for it. In his defense, Sessions is working to combat claims that he’s anti-Trump. In his announcement speech, Sessions said “the president is doing a great job for America and Alabama, and he has my strong support,” highlighting the fact that when Trump ran for president, Sessions was the first senator to back him. It’s clear that Sessions is wise to his greatest weakness (Trump); the big question is whether Alabama Republicans are willing to overlook Trump’s feelings to back him.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-is-great-at-everything-even-point-guard/,2019-11-11,,,features,"Nov. 11, 2019",LeBron Is Great At Everything — Even Point Guard,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"A handful of years ago, I analyzed which historical players LeBron James was most similar to in order to figure out how the legend might transition from his prime into the final phase of his career. As of his early 30s, James had played much like the perimeter stars of yesteryear, but his archetype had a few branching options going forward — including the potential to score less and focus more on all-around skills (think Scottie Pippen) or to morph more into a bruising, do-everything big man (think Karl Malone). The latter option seemed most intriguing, given that it appeared to be where James’s career was headed anyway and that it offered perhaps the most graceful long-term aging plan.
But James has proved once again that he is not bound by the constraints of ordinary basketball greatness. Just when it seemed like he might trend toward the paint, LeBron instead has veered further to the “guard” end of the playing-style spectrum — and thrived. First, he established himself as a master of the super-deep 3-point bomb, knocking down 33.6 percent of shots from 28 or more feet since 2017-18 (which ranks fifth among all NBA players1 over that span). And this year, when he was asked by head coach Frank Vogel to play point guard for a Los Angeles Lakers team without many other options, James has instantly become one of the league’s best at the position. As always, there doesn’t seem to be much that LeBron can’t do on the court when he sets his mind to it.
We can measure James’s effectiveness at the point in a number of ways, but the easiest is to simply look at his assist numbers. According to Basketball-Reference.com, James has been a helper on 51.8 percent of teammate baskets when he’s on the court, which both is a career high and good for second among all NBA players this season. An assist rate over 50 percent is pretty rarified territory; since the ABA merger in 1976, it’s been done only 17 times over a full season by qualified players. It’s typically a mark reserved for masters of the point guard craft, such as Chris Paul, John Stockton and Steve Nash.
James is also setting up high-quality looks with his passes. According to Second Spectrum tracking data, the expected effective field-goal percentage for teammates who shoot off of a pass from James is 54.5 percent, which ranks 18th-highest among the 196 players who have made at least 50 passes to shooters so far this season.
With James’s huge hike in assists have come extra turnovers — he now has a turnover rate of 14.0 percent, one of the highest in his career. But that’s to be expected, given his extra ball-handling workload. According to NBA Advanced Stats, James is currently second in the NBA in touches per game with 99.2, a 17 percent bump from what was already a very high rate a season ago. If we try to balance James’s assists against his turnovers with a single metric — in this case, John Hollinger’s Pure Point Rating, an enhanced version of the old assist-to-turnover ratio2 — James ranks third among qualified players this season, behind Indiana’s T.J. McConnell and Detroit’s Reggie Jackson. And neither of those guys are asked to do anywhere near as many other things (scoring, rebounding, defense, etc.) as the Lakers ask of James.
Finally, James’s effect on the Lakers’ offense this season has been immense. According to NBA Advanced Stats, Los Angeles is averaging 108.8 points per 100 possessions in the 316 minutes James has been on the court and a mere 89.7 per 100 in the 121 minutes he’s been absent. Even though James most often shares the court with Anthony Davis (another great scorer) and Danny Green (a deadly 3-point shooter), the Laker offense doesn’t suffer remotely as much without them as it does without James.3 It’s a big reason that James is tied for the sixth-highest offensive on/off rating in the league so far this year, according to FiveThirtyEight’s new RAPTOR player ratings.
Add all that up, and it’s surprisingly hard to find a point guard who’s been better than James this season when it comes to doing point guard stuff — such as setting up teammates, minimizing turnovers and making the offense run more efficiently.

And the scary thing is that in some aspects of the role, James is still learning how best to play the point.
“I’m getting better and better at the point guard position,” he told Spectrum SportsNet’s Mike Trudell after a recent win. “Just trying to know where my guys are, put them in a position to just be able to catch and shoot, catch and lay the ball up. Just making them as comfortable as possible out there, and coach Vogel is allowing me to run the show.”
The Lakers still rank just 19th in offensive efficiency, which, while an improvement over last season’s 24th-place finish, is still below where you might expect a team led by James and Davis to be. But L.A. is also tied for the best record in the Western Conference, and the team has to be thrilled with how quickly James has taken to his new role.
It’s just more evidence that, when it comes to playing the game of basketball, LeBron can still pretty much do whatever he wants — and do it well.

But it’s not totally clear from the polls which candidates can win a general election and, perhaps more importantly, which can’t. One set of polls released last week found former Vice President Joe Biden would only narrowly defeat Trump in six key swing states while the other top-tier candidates would be underdogs. Other polling finds all the top-polling Democrats — Biden, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders — would be very likely to defeat Trump.
So we’re left to mostly speculate. I’d expect electability talk to continue to be one of the defining features of this primary. But in my view, that conversation is lacking both nuance — at times veering too close to “Candidate X obviously can’t win” — and sophistication. Based on the coverage, you would think Medicare For All is the only policy position that really matters in terms of a candidate’s electability.
So I’m hoping, with less than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses, for a somewhat better discussion of electability. What might that sound like? Here are my three suggestions:
We should acknowledge and emphasize the uncertainty around electoral outcomes
Put simply, the amount we do know about the likelihood of different Democratic candidates defeating Trump may be greatly outweighed by what we don’t know.
Start with the polls, which have sparked much of the recent electability conversations. Surveys testing the eventual nominees conducted about a year before Election Day missed the actual margin by a huge amount, on average, in elections from 1944 through 2012.1 Year-out polls in 2016 and 2012 were closer to the mark, likely because partisan polarization has made presidential voting more predictable. Polls are inexact enough this far out that I just don’t think it’s worth making much of one candidate doing a few percentage points better than another against Trump in this or that poll.
That polarization, meanwhile, also probably limits the electability advantages or disadvantages of particular candidates. To put this bluntly, many voters are looking to back either a Democrat or a Republican — and that person’s party matters way more than their gender, race, sexual orientation or other individual factors.
“Electability is certainly still a thing, but the effect size has probably shrunk,” said Robert Griffin, an expert on voter demographics and the research director of the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group. He estimated that various presidential nominees from the same party would earn the same vote share, plus or minus 2 to 3 points, in a general election — although he emphasized that there is limited research on this question.
As Griffin’s estimate shows, there are surely some candidate effects on electability. Political science studies, particularly at the level of congressional elections, for example, have found that candidates closer to the political center do better in general elections. But even if that is true, I suspect that a fairly extreme candidate can still win in 2020 just by rallying co-partisans. Take 2016. It’s likely that a less controversial Republican, like former Ohio Gov. John Kasich or Sen. Marco Rubio, would have done better than Trump in the general election. But Trump still won.
Indeed, given Trump’s fairly low approval ratings and the high level of partisan polarization, Trump’s vote share likely has both a clear floor and ceiling. The 2020 Democratic nominee will probably enter the general election limited by a similarly narrow bound. Given this floor, Sanders and Warren are electable, even if they might be marginally less electable than Biden.
“It might make sense to talk about things in terms of a threshold, that someone is ‘electable enough,’” said Hans Noel, a Georgetown University professor and expert on party politics.
I’m not arguing that voters should disregard arguments about electability. I get why it matters. But I worry that some of the coverage in the press reads close to, “Candidate X can’t beat Trump.” Indeed, polling shows lots of Democratic voters have come to think about electability in those kinds of absolute terms. We need the coverage to hew more towards, “We don’t have much certainty about electability. Lots of candidates could win or lose. That said, Candidate X may have a slightly better chance against Trump than Candidate Y.”
It’s worth contextualizing electability
In addition to recognizing uncertainty, the electability conversation could use a lot more specifics, too. Democratic candidates could be “more electable” in different ways. Here are some common ones, all of which stem from areas where Hillary Clinton fell short against Trump in 2016:
Winning more white, working-class voters in the Midwest (the much-discussed Obama-Trump voters, especially in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the states Clinton narrowly lost) by taking more centrist policy positions.
Winning more white, working-class voters in the Midwest by being more populist.
Winning 2012 Obama voters, particularly blacks, who stayed home or voted for a third-party candidate in 2016 in the Midwest and in Florida in particular. I don’t think this strategy necessarily has an ideological bent — these voters might be reached by policy positions and perhaps just a candidate they connect with more, like Obama.
Winning states with big Latino (Arizona, Florida, Texas) or black (Georgia, North Carolina) populations by maximizing turnout among people of color.
Much of the electability coverage in the news media revolves winning the white working class. It assumes that Biden, in particular, is best positioned to win the general election because his more moderate ideological positioning will better appeal to white Obama-Trump voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. That might be correct. But the evidence we have now doesn’t totally support that conclusion: Biden (+10) is doing best in head-to-head polls against Trump, followed by Sanders (+8), then Warren (+7), then Harris (+5) and Buttigieg (+5), according to averages of national polls from RealClearPolitics. That doesn’t line up with being more moderate on policy making you more electable, since the candidates are probably Biden-Buttigieg-Harris-Warren-Sanders, in terms of who is most centrist, at least on the policy positions they have proposed in this campaign.2 It should also give some pause about relying so much on early polls. Since Buttigieg in particular is less well-known than Biden, that probably hurts the mayor’s numbers right now.
And the electability discussion mostly ignores the other options: being more populist, or winning over more black and Latino voters. (It also ignores other, more speculative ways to gain an electoral advantage, like, say, a surge in youth turnout.) Take running a more populist campaign or appealing to black voters, respectively: Casting Warren and Sanders as less electable than Biden essentially assumes that the two most populist candidates in the primary won’t be able to appeal to white working-class voters, and that the two most liberal candidates can’t win over Jill Stein voters or inspire young blacks who might have stayed home over backing Clinton. Those assumptions might be true, but I’m not sure.
Even the conversation about winning the Midwestern white working class may be missing the mark. I think it’s entirely possible that Biden is perceived to be a better general election candidate because of factors unrelated to ideology and harder to talk about in public. He may be perceived as more “likable” or relatable than other candidates, a quality that might carry gender or racial undertones. Is that perception because of his actual policy stances, or because he is an older straight white man? (Also, even perceptions of his ideology might be affected by his race and gender. Research suggests that voters view women and people of color as more liberal than their actual issue positions.)
Here’s another way that electability and policy might be being linked too closely. The news coverage I read about Warren often casts her as a risky general election candidate largely because of her left-wing positions. But when I talk to Democratic voters, they often worry that her gender is the problem and that some voters won’t back her because of sexism. This is a challenging subject to talk about — but if a big part of the election is electability, it’s worth being more explicit and detailed. In assessing Warren, Democratic voters are weighing policy positions but also gender and sexism. Why is this important? Because if Warren doesn’t win the nomination and a big factor was Democratic voters felt that her Medicare for All position was a potential general election killer, that’s Warren’s fault. If we learn that voters were wary of nominating Warren because she is a woman, that’s not really Warren’s fault and speaks to more general societal challenges.
We should talk more about trade-offs
In the context of a Democratic primary, some types of electability may come at a price — a price many Democratic voters might not want to pay. That price should be more of a factor in the electability debate.
Democratic candidates trying to maximize electability, for example, may be more cautious on policy, particularly by taking stands on racial issues that prioritize America’s white majority over its people of color. In his 1992 campaign, for example, Bill Clinton went out of his way to criticize a black rapper and activist named Sister Souljah at an event put on by Jesse Jackson Sr.’s civil rights group. Black scholars bemoaned how little President Obama spoke about poverty or racial issues from 2009-12, as he positioned himself for reelection.
When Biden was asked about the “legacy of slavery” in a debate earlier this year and segued into talking about black parents needing to play records to their children, that was covered as a gaffe by the candidate. It was. It was also Biden invoking racial language that might be more appealing to Obama-Trump voters than Black Lives Matter activists.
In this campaign, several candidates are supporting a proposal to study the idea of reparations for black Americans as restitution for slavery and Jim Crow-era discrimination. Biden, though, has been noncommittal about the proposal. Reparations aren’t popular: Only 29 percent of Americans support the idea, according to a recent Associated Press-NORC poll. (So that explains Biden’s wariness.) But there’s a huge racial split on the issue — 74 percent of black Americans support reparations, compared to 15 percent of white Americans.
When we’re talking about electability, it’s worth explaining this trade-off (“Biden is wary of embracing a reparations study, likely to preserve his electability”), particularly since the 2020 campaign has focused a lot on the reverse version of this dynamic (essentially, “Sanders embraces Medicare For All, potentially reducing his electability”). In other words, to maximize electability, what liberal goals are considered expendable by Democratic candidates? Some Democrats want a female president. But is that desire outweighed by the desire to beat Trump?


To conclude, I think it’s natural that, because Democrats desperately want Trump out of office, the Democratic nomination battle has turned into a debate over electability. I just want that debate to be more appreciative of the complexity and uncertainty around all of this.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

It was a week of surprise wins, including a Vikings victory that I 100 percent did not think was going to happen. In East Rutherford, someone had to win — and the Jets did!
neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): I like how the Jets wore the black unis a week after that black cat ran on the field.
New mascot!
joshua.hermsmeyer (Josh Hermsmeyer, NFL analyst): Transparent pandering to the football gods.
The Giants are dead last in yards per play and EPA per play against zone defense this season. The Jets gave them a heavy dose, and Week 10 they were again at the bottom of the league in yards per play.
neil: Every year, I’m like, “Hmm, I’d better write that story about how long it’s been since both the Jets and Giants were this bad at once.”
And it somehow is never too late.
Salfino (Michael Salfino, FiveThirtyEight contributor): I’m trying to mentally block out this entire Jets season. But 13 Saquon Barkley carries for 1 yard is one of the weirdest stats ever.
neil: One yard!
Amazing.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Inches per carry is my new advanced metric.
neil: That’s 2.8 inches per carry.

Salfino: Is that really the math? Hilarious.
The Jets are great at stuff that doesn’t matter, like run defense.
sara.ziegler: I was all ready for that game to be unwatchable, but the thing about two bad teams playing each other is that it can be pretty entertaining.
Salfino: Daniel Jones’s passing was top-shelf, but you have to think his inexperience is causing issues with Barkley’s running, as it relates to just getting into good looks and out of bad ones, pre-snap. But I’m speculating.
neil: Just to close the loop on Saquon: In 1974, Benny Malone lost 3 rushing yards on 14 carries. That’s the fewest ever by somebody with at least 13 carries in a game.
But Barkley’s performance is up (down?) there too.
joshua.hermsmeyer: If I were also speculating, I’d say that there’s a real lack of creativity in the running game. Saquon is clearly #good, and if he was in a system that wasn’t so “2019 vanilla,” I think they’d have more success in the run game, especially against defenses missing all their linebackers like the Jets.
neil: Yeah. Gotta stop running those “1974 Benny Malone” plays.
Salfino: That’s funny because Malone had arguably the greatest run in postseason history.
neil: Wow. Some shades of Marshawn Lynch, who had the other GOAT playoff run, in there.
sara.ziegler: That’s an interesting point, Josh, and I think it brings up something people don’t understand about running backs.
It’s not that the running game doesn’t matter. It does!
joshua.hermsmeyer: The running game matters very much, Sara.
sara.ziegler: I think people miss that when we talk about individual running backs being less important to the game overall.
neil: Although sometimes that is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the average run creates negative expected points added.
Salfino: Does the running game matter, though? Look at San Francisco, with their defense giving up almost 5 yards per carry. I mean, everything matters and everything at the extreme matters more, but if I were building a team, Job 1 is passing and Job 2 is stopping the pass. I don’t care about Job 3.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Yeah, the points can get conflated. The other misunderstanding I see regarding the argument for RB replaceability is that it’s not a negative assessment of talent. It’s really about overall excellence and talent evaluation at the position. Finding good backs is a solved problem at the NFL level.
Salfino: Yet we must endure Kalen Ballage.
joshua.hermsmeyer: LOL
neil: And even Ballage averaged 5.3 yards per carry last season, his rookie year. Running backs, smh.
sara.ziegler: Speaking of Ballage, how about those tanking Dolphins!
Salfino: The only RB in the post-merger NFL with fewer yards per carry than Ballage through nine games, with a minimum 50 carries, is Ron Johnson of the 1974 Giants. See, 1974 is a theme today. Like it!
sara.ziegler: LOLOL
Did the Dolphins forget that losing is a key component to tanking?
neil: The Dolphins really blew their shot at the No. 1 pick. Now they have to leapfrog three other teams! According to ESPN’s model, Miami has only a 17 percent chance of picking first next year.
Salfino: Brian Hoyer thought he was tanking.
sara.ziegler: Easy mistake to make when you’ve played for as many teams as Hoyer has.
Salfino: Maybe Jacoby Brissett isn’t bad.
joshua.hermsmeyer: He’s slightly above average!
I think the issue with the Colts heading into the season was that they risked the 8-8 prison of mediocrity. It seemed like perhaps they would escape it with Brissett, but Hoyer may drag them back down.
neil: The past few weeks have been really rough for Indy’s playoff odds.
The Colts were 67 percent to make it and 47 percent to win the division two weeks ago. Now those numbers are 32 percent and 20 percent, respectively.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Whew.
Salfino: What are the Steelers’ playoff odds? What an amazing turnaround. I never saw that coming without Ben Roethlisberger. I really have no idea how they’re doing it.
neil: Yeah, somehow they are now more likely to make it than not! We have the Steelers at 56 percent.
sara.ziegler: And then there’s Pittsburgh’s opponent on Sunday, the Rams. Eek.
Salfino: Jared Goff has a lower QBR than Sam Darnold, and Jets fans are checking the return policy on Darnold. But Goff’s offensive line is banged up and has been bad all year. No catches for Cooper Kupp on Sunday? That’s almost as shocking as Barkley’s day. What is the problem here? Are the Rams just dead now?
neil: But I thought Sean McVay was a generational talent! Shouldn’t he be able to scheme out of this?
Salfino: I would think so, if he were worthy of his hype, yes.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I think that when the scheme experts break down the Rams’ season the conclusion will be that Bill Belichick (and Matt Patricia’s scheme) broke McVay.
And while analytics types like me sometimes say the league is inefficient, this is clearly an example of it being wildly so.
Salfino: Is there an RBs-are-not-fungible thing going on with Todd Gurley? They can’t find anyone to replace what he’s lost.
neil: So it turns out CJ Anderson’s playoff success didn’t prove that Gurley was just a cog in the machine after all?
joshua.hermsmeyer: Aren’t they running OK?
neil: Ehhhhh … they’re 23rd in rushing EPA per game, 22nd in yards per carry.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Yeah, bottom third. But ahead of the Patriots.
Salfino: Plus zero explosion in the running game.
neil: Somehow they are actually tied for 13th in net yards per passing attempt.
Salfino: But Goff’s QBR is trash.
neil: His TD-to-INT ratio sucks.
sara.ziegler: He looks lost out there.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Ah, I found the stat showing the Rams aren’t horrible at running: eighth in success rate, which relates to plays that generate a positive EPA.
That said, without the explosive plays, as Mike mentioned, that’s not a really fearsome part of their offense.
Salfino: Bigger disappointment: the Rams or the Cowboys?
sara.ziegler: Well, the Rams are down to just 25 percent to make the playoffs, and the Cowboys still have a 50 percent shot.
Salfino: Dak Prescott looked so unstoppable that I’m shocked the Cowboys lost. Jerry Jones has put up with a lot, but this might be a new standard. Dallas is just 5-4 with all this talent on both sides of the ball: They lead the NFL in yards per play and overall offense, they’re seventh in overall defense and they’re third in net yards per pass play gained minus those allowed (the two teams above them in that measure have combined for one loss). Has any coach ever won less with more than Jason Garrett this year?
Would you fire Garrett?
joshua.hermsmeyer: No, I don’t think you can. But I would certainly tell him to not meddle in offensive play calling.
Salfino: Cowboys are plus-81 in points. Yet 5-4. Do we give the coaching credit for all the stats or crush it for the meh record?
sara.ziegler: I think that as long as they make the playoffs, it won’t matter.
Salfino: Getting to Josh’s point, Dallas should abandon the run more because Ezekiel Elliott seems to have lost a little, and Dak and the passing game has passed him by. This should be Dak’s team now.
neil: For the record, Dak continues to have an amazing season. He ranks third in our Elo QB metric, behind only Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson.
(Then again, both Mahomes and Dak played great and lost this week. Go figure.)
Also, the Cowboys lost to a GOOD TEAM.
aka Sara’s VIKINGS.
Salfino: Sara won’t admit it, but correct.
joshua.hermsmeyer: With a QB in the MVP discussion!
sara.ziegler: They’re FINE.
neil: Hahaha
Sara has an adjusted scale for the Vikings.
“Bad” = Average
“OK” = Pretty good!
“FINE” = Great
joshua.hermsmeyer: That scale is uniquely Minnesota.
Salfino: I think the Vikings have problems in the defensive backfield, but they somehow get away with it. Not just yesterday but more generally, too.
sara.ziegler: This game went a long way toward me getting my hopes up way too high before they are eventually dashed. So that’s fun.
neil: The thing I worry about for them is that they’re still not favored to win the division. We only give them a 34 percent shot.
So that means a wild card date and … probably some kind of season-ending kicking mishap.
😬
sara.ziegler: LOL, sigh.
neil: Trouble is, those darned Packers keep winning.
sara.ziegler: Green Bay impressed me on Sunday with one of those classic, snow-in-Lambeau wins.

neil: I love the snow at Lambeau. Is there anything more “football” than that?
joshua.hermsmeyer: Nope. There’s something very backyard football about it. It’s awesome.
Salfino: The Vikings are better than the Packers, but that may not matter in winning the division.
sara.ziegler: The Vikes get another shot at the Packers — and another shot at losing inexplicably to the Bears.
neil: Yeah, I think we said at the time that earlier Bears loss could haunt them.
sara.ziegler: ^^^ evergreen
Salfino: Can’t get excited by the Packers notching a home win against Kyle Allen.
neil: At least you can get excited about them stopping Christian McCaffrey in a game-deciding situation!
Salfino: Well, you want to put the ball in his hands with the game on the line.
neil: The Panthers certainly were determined to do that.
sara.ziegler: The game that confused me the most on Sunday was Saints-Falcons. Atlanta’s defense looked … good? How?
neil: That was basically the Falcons team that has been MIA all year. Or, like, two years.
Salfino: Drew Brees was sacked a Saints-high six times for the third time in his career, and they’re 0-3 in those games. He’s been sacked five or more times seven times, and they’re 1-6 in those. We all know sacks are bad, but few understand how truly terrible they are. They are like mini-turnovers.
neil: That was also the biggest upset of the entire season per Elo. It gave ATL only a 12 percent chance to win. (And that was knowing Matt Ryan would play.)
In fact, two of 2019’s five biggest upsets happened yesterday: The Falcons over the Saints (12 percent), and the Dolphins over the Colts (20 percent).
joshua.hermsmeyer: Well, it’s become increasingly hard to accuse Miami of in-game tanking.
neil: The funniest thing in the Falcons’ win was that Ryan didn’t even play very well. He only had a 78.5 passer rating.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Boo passer rating!
neil: I mean, it’s shorthand.
His adjusted yards per attempt was 5.06. Still subpar by his standards.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Yeah, that’s not great.
Salfino: Yes, Atlanta’s offense was generally underwhelming. They won the game on defense. Alvin Kamara did not look like himself off the leg injuries, and while Michael Thomas is super efficient, he does not produce a lot of points with big plays/touchdowns. The longest of his 13 catches was 18 yards.
neil: The Falcons have lost games where Ryan had passer ratings (I know, I know) of 145, 121 and 103 this year.
They win the one where he has a 79.
Salfino: Passer rating generally correlates pretty well to winning, FWIW.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Gase said recently that the Jets were sacrificing stats to try and win. Perhaps Matty Ice sacrificed his for the Falcons.
neil: Certainly he was having one of the all-time “great stats, no wins” seasons up to this point. Maybe he took on a Costanza Strategy?
Salfino: The 2019 Cowboys are one of the all-time stats teams without the winning.
neil: Nothing will ever top the 2010 Chargers, but we’ll see how close they can get.
sara.ziegler: To Josh’s point about the Dolphins and their lack of tanking, why are they starting Ryan Fitzpatrick over Josh Rosen? It’s bad on every level: You’re not giving Rosen the chance to develop, and you’re not actually losing games to get the top pick to replace Rosen next year.
Salfino: But who even is the top pick? I think that’s the problem with tanking in the NFL. I know Josh says it’s about draft capital throughout the draft, but then why does it matter that much if you pick first or fourth overall? Unless you want to trade the QB pick, then you clean up.
neil: Yeah, is Tua Tagovailoa really the clear-cut home run guy you tank for?
Salfino: And Joe Burrow is very old for a QB prospect. He’s older than Darnold, for example.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I’ve seen arguments that the Dolphins could still trade up, and perhaps that explains why they are less concerned with a smattering of wins this season. But I think there’s a simpler explanation: It sucks to be on a team that’s losing. I was talking to a guy with a team over the weekend and he said, “Man I get the tanking argument, but do you know how terrible it is to spend a year losing?” So living through that hell in the hyper-competitive NFL can take its toll. These two wins might be beneficial despite the loss of draft capital.
Salfino: Plus the coaches want to win. You tank and your career is probably over. The fans will demand it.
neil: I could see that. Baseball and basketball offer up more total losses for tankers, but the physical and emotional toll of playing football — destroying your body and losing — is on another level from those other sports.
Salfino: The Bengals are probably unintentionally executing the perfect tank. They snuck up on us.
Benching Andy Dalton was a master stroke. The Bengals are bageling for Burrow?
neil: Dalton currently has a higher QB Elo than Mitch Trubisky. LOL
sara.ziegler: Oooh, that Bengals game. At least it gave us a Lamar Jackson spin move for the ages.
neil: I loved this moment in the postgame presser:

Salfino: Ironically, the people who said Jackson is a great running back were right. He just also happens to be a quarterback.
joshua.hermsmeyer: * WR
Salfino: Oh, that makes zero sense.
neil: The lines between QB and RB are blurring in Baltimore. They used RGIII at RB yesterday.
Salfino: That’s going to mess up game logs forever, Neil.
joshua.hermsmeyer:  I mean they said he was everything other than what he is: a great QB. Since we talked about passer rating, Lamar is the first QB since 2007 to have two perfect passer rating games in one season on his resume.
neil: At one point, they had three Heisman winners — Jackson, Griffin and Mark Ingram — in the backfield at once.
That has to be a record.
Salfino: Love that stat.
joshua.hermsmeyer: My only comment — and the only comment needed, really.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/icing-the-play-caller-really-doesnt-work/,2019-11-09,,,features,"Nov. 8, 2019",Icing The Play-Caller Really Doesn’t Work,Josh Hermsmeyer,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"With four seconds left until halftime, trailing the San Francisco 49ers in a 14-7 game, the Arizona Cardinals defense had forced a fourth and goal at the 1-yard line. In what turned out to be a pivotal moment in the game, Niners quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo handed off to Jeff Wilson Jr. for a run up the middle that was stuffed for no gain. But what should have been cause for celebration for the Cardinals defense quickly turned into disappointment. The refs waived off the result; Arizona head coach Kliff Kingsbury had called a timeout before the play began.
San Francisco made Kingsbury pay on the next play, with Garoppolo tossing an easy touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders as time expired. After the game (which the Cardinals ended up losing 28-25), Kingsbury explained his reasoning behind the timeout, saying that the stoppage was to get a better look at what the 49ers might be planning offensively and that he “wanted them to hopefully burn their best play.”
Unfamiliar with the concept of burning a play, I reached out to a handful of coaches and experts to understand what Kingsbury might have meant. I was told that teams will often carry just three or four 2-point conversion plays into a game because of the rarity of the situation. Since the inventory of available plays is limited, a coach will usually call his favorite one first. Once a team lines up, some of the surprise is lost, so calling a timeout could force the play-caller to abandon the best play in favor of one the defense hasn’t yet seen.
One obvious problem with this explanation is that goal-line stands aren’t 2-point conversions. A play run on fourth and 1 at the goal line has some similarities with a 2-point conversion attempt — they’re both near the end zone, after all — but I was told that teams won’t necessarily limit themselves to their 2-point playsheets in goal-to-go situations. And if that was true of the 49ers, a timeout wouldn’t exhaust play inventory in the way Kingsbury might have assumed. For the gambit to work, it seems that a coach would need to have fairly detailed information about how an opponent organizes and prepares its game plan.
This made me wonder: Is there any evidence to suggest that icing the play-caller is a successful tactic? Do defenses tend to fare better following a timeout on fourth and goal at the 1-yard line? To find out, using data from Armchair Analysis, I looked at every play run on that down and distance from 2000 to 2018 in both the regular season and playoffs. I separated timeouts called by the offense from those called by the defense and compared the touchdown rate on plays with timeouts to plays with no timeouts called. The results were surprising.

On goal-line stands after the defense calls a timeout, offenses score a touchdown about 17 percentage points more often than when no timeout is called, on average. Defenses have called timeouts in these situations just 46 times in the past 18 years, so there is still uncertainty about the true difference in touchdown rates, but there’s also no evidence that the touchdown rate after those timeouts is lower. In other words, the benefits of icing the play-caller appear to not exist — and the call may backfire more often than not, just as we saw with Kingsbury against the 49ers.
Perhaps this result shouldn’t be surprising. We’ve known for a while that icing the kicker is likely ineffective. In their book “Scorecasting,” Tobias Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim found that when they adjusted for distance, field goals attempted in high-pressure situations weren’t affected by defensive timeouts. If athletes aren’t affected, why would we think coaches would be rattled by a little gamesmanship? A play-caller’s job is to choose plays, and a timeout probably just gives him more time than usual to do it.

Poll(s) of the week
Just a few weeks ago, the future of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign was fairly uncertain. On Oct. 1, Sanders was hospitalized and suspended campaign events “until further notice,” and it wasn’t until days later that his campaign confirmed that he had had a heart attack. Questions about whether Sanders would stay in the race or skip the October debate abounded, but ultimately Sanders stuck it out and returned to the trail. And it seems as if his debate performance may have helped him bounce back in the polls.
In fact, this week, a new poll from Reuters/Ipsos found Sanders ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 15 percent to 11 percent.1 To be clear, in national polling averages like RealClearPolitics and The Economist, Sanders is still in third behind Warren, but when we compared Sanders’s pre- and post-debate polls, we found what looks like a small post-debate bounce.
We looked at all the national primary polls conducted in the three weeks before the Oct. 15 debate and three weeks after and calculated the pre- and post-debate averages for all the candidates who participated in the debate (excluding former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has since dropped out of the race). We first created a pollster average by averaging together all the polls from a single pollster in each time period, and then we averaged those pollster averages together to get one pre-debate and one post-debate number for each candidate. (This average of averages method means that if one pollster ran a lot of polls, it wouldn’t skew the overall average.) Although only a few polls showed Sanders ahead of Warren like in the Reuters/Ipsos poll, it certainly seems like his strong debate performance may have eased voters’ concerns about his health.
Of the three leading candidates in the race, Sanders had the largest gain in the polls after the debate, and Warren actually saw a slight decline in support. In fact, with Warren’s drop and Sanders’s gain, the gap between second and third place shrank by about 3 points in our average, from 6.8 points to 3.6 points. Technically, Buttigieg saw the largest gains following the debate — 1.7 points — but his national average is still 10 points lower than Sanders’s.

The fact that Sanders has made gains after the debate is bullish news for his campaign, though, because heading into the debate, the public was pretty wary about his health. In a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted the week after his heart attack, just 17 percent of Americans thought the senator was healthy enough to serve effectively as president, and the share among Democrats — 26 percent — was not much higher. By comparison, 60 percent of Democrats said former Vice President Joe Biden, who is just a year younger than Sanders, was in good enough health to serve.
Americans were also not pleased with how the Sanders campaign handled news of his heart attack. In an Economist/YouGov poll conducted after Sanders was released from the hospital, the largest share of respondents — 39 percent — said they were unsure if the campaign had been transparent about the heart attack. The rest of the respondents were fairly split: 33 percent said the campaign was transparent, while 27 percent said it was not.
So going into the last debate, it really did seem as if Sanders’s health scare had set him back in voters’ eyes. And while Sanders didn’t see huge gains in his post-debate average, what’s really important here is that his average didn’t fall. In other words, Sanders’s heart attack may not wind up costing him much in terms of his campaign. That said, it’s not all sunshine and daisies for Sanders. While he seems to have a solid hold on third place, it’s unclear whether he can expand beyond his base and make a play for second or first. One thing that is certain, though, is that Sanders is a successful grassroots fundraiser, so he can definitely afford to keep campaigning in search of a bigger base.
Other polling bites: 
Facebook continues to take a hands-off approach toward political ads by refusing to regulate or fact-check them. Unfortunately for CEO Mark Zuckerburg, most voters — 59 percent — “somewhat” or “strongly” oppose the idea of social media platforms choosing not to remove advertisements that include lies, according to a recent Morning Consult poll. In fact, 77 percent of voters — including 81 percent of Democrats and 77 percent of Republicans — said they either “strongly” or “somewhat” support a law that ensures advertisements on social media (including political ads) are factual.
According to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll, 54 percent of Americans think Trump deserves a “great deal” or “some” amount of credit for the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. By contrast, when the Washington Post asked about President Obama’s role in the death of Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida’s then-leader, in 2011, 76 percent of Americans thought Obama deserved “a great deal” or “some” amount of credit.
In a Fox News poll released on Sunday, 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters said they would definitely vote for former first lady Michelle Obama if she entered the race. Twenty-seven percent said the same about Hillary Clinton, and just 6 percent said that about Michael Bloomberg.
According to that same Fox News poll, 57 percent of respondents who said they do not support the impeachment of President Trump said “nothing would cause [them] to support impeachment.” However, 34 percent said that “new evidence could make [them] support impeachment.”
Young Americans seem to be more politically engaged this election cycle than in 2016, according to a poll from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School. In total, 30 percent of Americans under 30 consider themselves to be politically engaged, which might not sound like a lot, but that’s up 10 percentage points from this point in the last presidential election cycle.
We set the clocks back last Sunday — and it’s now dark at 5 p.m. in New York, I’m sad to report. It turns out many Americans feel similarly. According to an AP-NORC poll from late October, just 28 percent of Americans prefer switching back and forth between standard time and daylight saving time over a system where the clock stayed the same year-round. Another 40 percent favored using standard time all year and 31 percent preferred daylight saving time all year.
There is a general election coming up in the UK on Dec. 12, and in the latest Opinium/Observer poll, the Conservatives comfortably led the Labour Party 42 percent to 26 percent. In third place were the Liberal Democrats at 16 percent, followed by the Brexit Party at 9 percent, and a few other parties polling below 5 percent. If the Conservatives hold this lead, they would have a majority in parliament.
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 41.4 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 54.3 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -12.9 points). At this time last week, 41.1 percent approved and 54.1 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -13 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 41.5 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.7 percent, for a net approval rating of -12.2 points.
Generic ballot 
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 5.4 percentage points (46.7 percent to 41.3 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 5.5 points (46.4 percent to 40.9 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.9 points (46.9 percent to 40.0 percent).",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

In many ways, Tuesday’s elections were a dress rehearsal for those a year from now: The parties’ performance relative to partisanship can tell us which way the political winds might be blowing, and obvious trends from 2019 — like the widening urban-rural divide — provide clues as to where the battles of 2020 will be fought.
As I wrote in April and again in September, special elections in 2019 have not shown the same clear, overwhelming pattern of Democratic dominance as they did in 2017 and 2018. But the sample size was relatively small — until Tuesday, when Virginia held elections in all 40 of its state Senate seats and all 100 of its House of Delegates seats. Although they’re not full-fledged special elections, you can analyze these races in much the same way, looking for how each party performed relative to the base partisanship of the districts. And in Virginia, Democrats not only did well in absolute terms (they flipped two Senate seats and six House seats), but they also outperformed the FiveThirtyEight partisan leans1 of their districts in most of those races. (Elections also took place on Tuesday for the Mississippi state Senate, Mississippi state House and New Jersey General Assembly. However, we did not include these races in our analysis because 2016 and 2012 presidential results by legislative district are unavailable in Mississippi and because New Jersey Assembly districts elect two legislators each, with all candidates in the district running in the same race.2 This irregular arrangement makes Assembly races too different from typical elections to compare.)
Specifically, in the Virginia state Senate, the average winning margin was 4 points more Democratic than the average partisan lean.

Includes only races where both a Democrat and a Republican were on the ballot. Results are unofficial and as of noon Eastern on Nov. 7.
FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric is the average difference between how a district votes and how the country votes overall, with 2016 presidential election results weighted at 50 percent, 2012 presidential election results weighted at 25 percent and results from elections for the state legislature weighted at 25 percent. Partisan leans do not incorporate the results of this year’s elections.

Includes only races where both a Democrat and a Republican were on the ballot. Does not include HD-80, because an independent received more than 10 percent of the vote. Results are unofficial and as of noon Eastern on Nov. 7.
FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric is the average difference between how a district votes and how the country votes overall, with 2016 presidential election results weighted at 50 percent, 2012 presidential election results weighted at 25 percent and results from elections for the state legislature weighted at 25 percent. Partisan leans do not incorporate the results of this year’s elections.

Because partisan lean is meant to represent a district’s partisanship in a neutral political environment, that’s consistent with a somewhat Democratic-leaning national mood, like the one we see in polls of the generic congressional ballot — though not nearly as Democratic-leaning as 2018, when Democrats won the House popular vote by almost 9 points.
Any discussion about Virginia and partisan lean, though, should include the caveat that the state is well-educated (only five states and D.C. have a higher share of the population over age 25 with a bachelor’s degree or higher) and highly suburban (nine of its 11 congressional districts are classified as some level of suburban, according to CityLab) — traits that might make it more likely to rebel against the Republican Party in the age of Donald Trump. Indeed, most of the few seats where Republicans did better than partisanship would suggest were in more rural areas. Meanwhile, districts Democrats flipped were largely suburban.
But that in and of itself is an important takeaway of the 2019 elections: Rural areas got redder, and urban and suburban ones got bluer — and not only in Virginia. Even for centrist Democrats like Mississippi gubernatorial candidate Jim Hood, the old, pre-Trump Democratic coalition has been replaced by one that increasingly relies on suburban voters to make up for losses among rural whites. Four years after being elected Mississippi attorney general with 55 percent of the vote, Hood won just 47 percent on Tuesday — yet he still managed to improve his vote share in DeSoto County (the Memphis suburbs) by 6 points, more than in any other county. And Madison County (the Jackson suburbs), the county with the highest per-capita income in the state, was the one county he lost in 2015 but carried in 2019. Meanwhile, his vote share dropped precipitously in the rural white counties of northeast Mississippi — from 54 percent to 21 percent in Itawamba County, for example.
In Kentucky, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andy Beshear turned in a more impressive performance overall, turning a 9-point Democratic loss in the 2015 race into (probably) a half-point win. According to an exit poll conducted by a consortium of political scientists,3 he did so by winning 16 percent of Republican voters and defeating (admittedly unpopular) Republican Gov. Matt Bevin by 27 points among independents. But Beshear’s strongest overperformances relative to his 2015 counterpart, Jack Conway, came in urban and suburban areas. Beshear won Jefferson County (home of Louisville) with a whopping 67 percent of the vote, while Conway won Jefferson with just 58 percent. And perhaps most impressively, Beshear won a combined 47 percent in the three most populous counties in the Cincinnati suburbs: In 2015, Conway got only 37 percent across Boone, Campbell and Kenton counties. In the rest of the commonwealth — mostly rural areas — Beshear won 42 percent of the vote, not too much better than Conway’s 39 percent. So it’s fair to say that Beshear won where Conway lost because of his strength in metropolitan areas.
Elsewhere in the country, Democrats’ suburban victories seemed to confirm that there is still ground for the party to gain in suburban congressional districts, even after the inroads it made in 2018. In Hamilton County, Indiana, for instance, Democrats unexpectedly won three seats on city councils that have not had Democratic members in living memory. These Indianapolis suburbs are the anchor of Indiana’s 5th Congressional District, whose GOP representative is retiring in 2020. In the suburbs southwest of St. Louis, Democrats flipped Missouri House District 99 in a special election. The district had a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+11, and the Democratic candidate won by 8 points, making for a dramatic 19-point margin swing. If the same thing happens in Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District, which covers Missouri House District 99, it would be enough to flip the seat from red to blue (the 2nd District’s FiveThirtyEight partisan lean is R+16). Finally, in the northern suburbs of Philadelphia, Democrats put Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick on notice by winning every row office and a majority on the board of commissioners in Bucks County, which makes up most of Fitzpatrick’s Pennsylvania 1st Congressional District. (Democrats also seized control of county government in the other two major Philadelphia collar counties — Chester and Delaware — for the first time in more than 150 years.)
There’s one last lesson that the 2019 results suggest about 2020, but it’s one that we already knew: Turnout is likely to be through the roof. In Kentucky, we estimate based on preliminary data that 43 percent of the voting-eligible population cast a ballot for governor; not only is that much, much higher than the 30 percent of the voting-eligible population that we estimate turned out in 2015, but it’s also higher than the 42 percent who voted in the Senate race in the regular 2010 midterm election. In Virginia, we already know that more people voted than in any state-legislative-only election since at least 1976 — and The Washington Post estimates that there could be thousands of votes left to count. If we see a corresponding spike in turnout between 2016 (already a pretty high-turnout election by recent standards) and 2020, polling places could be overwhelmed with voters. Americans are telling pollsters that their levels of interest in the upcoming election are at unprecedented highs — and according to one recent poll, they are already more excited about voting than they were on the eve of the 2016 and 2012 elections!

HIV-1 Group M subtype L
A new, extremely rare strain of HIV, called HIV-1 group M subtype L, was discovered by a research group from the health care and medical device company Abbott. One expert says the new study indicates that the HIV epidemic is “still evolving.” More than 37 million people live with HIV worldwide. [Scientific American]
1,300 flights
If they weren’t already sick of cramped seats and baggage fees, approximately 180,000 passengers will now also experience travel disruptions after Lufthansa cancelled 1,300 flights scheduled to leave on Thursday and Friday. The company lost a last-minute legal bid to prevent a strike by its cabin crew, and the union’s vice president has warned there may be additional strikes. Lufthansa is offering rail tickets and alternative flights to affected passengers. [BBC News]
$15 monthly cell phone plan
T-Mobile has promised to offer 2 GB of monthly data for as little as $15 a month if its planned merger with Sprint is allowed to proceed. The cheap data plan, along with other discounted services like free wireless service for first responders, was offered as a response to concerns that the merger will reduce competition. T-Mobile’s current cheapest data plan costs $30, and a similar 2 GB plan is currently available from competitor AT&T for $30 per month. [The Wall Street Journal]
32 percent of recruits
The New York Times reports on Amherst College’s multi-year initiative to overhaul how it recruits student-athletes so that its teams will better reflect the diversity of its overall student body and include more underrepresented ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Three years ago, only 23 percent of recruited players were people of color, so the recruiting strategy branched beyond the usual youth sports tournaments to include athletic clubs in mixed neighborhoods, small urban gyms and athletes in other countries. The college says athletes of color account for 32 percent of its most recent recruiting class, a significant change from 2002, when that number was only 11 percent. [The New York Times]
47 percent passage rate
New analysis of government data by BuzzFeed News shows that Border Patrol agents conducting initial screenings of asylum-seekers are granting far fewer people preliminary access to the country — Border Patrol agents are approving 47 percent of cases, compared to an 80 percent approval rate for the Citizenship and Immigration Services officers who normally conduct the screenings, according to publicly available data. Initial asylum screenings are used to determine whether a person has a legitimate fear of persecution in their home country; if it is determined that they do, their case is referred to an immigration judge who will hear their case in detail. But Trump administration officials have criticized the screening process for being too lenient and assigned around 60 Border Patrol agents to conduct screenings in June. [BuzzFeed News]
Low wages for 44 percent of workers
Indicators like the unemployment rate and workforce participation might appear to show a strong labor market, but a new report from the Brookings Institution shows that 44 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 are earning low wages. That includes an estimated 53 million Americans, who make a median wage of $10.22 per hour and an annual income of only $17,950. There’s also not a lot of upward movement either, with the survey showing that even when workers who earn low wages switch jobs, they have a 52 percent chance of remaining in the $10-to-$15-per-hour wage bracket. [Bloomberg]
24 pounds of sea scallops
The effects of climate change are wide-ranging, including shifting water temperatures and mass die-offs of sea creatures. For hundreds of years, bay scallops from the Peconic Estuary fed Long Islanders, but when the scallop season opened Monday, it became clear that most of the adult scallops were dead, likely because the water got into the mid-80s Fahrenheit several times this past summer, which is hot enough to kill scallops. One longtime distributor only sold 24 pounds of local Peconic scallops on the first day of scallop season this year, compared to the 2,000 pounds he sold last year. [The New York Times]

Enigmatic, chain-smoking manager Maurizio Sarri left the club after just one season at the helm, returning to Italy to coach Juventus; it sold its best player (and perhaps the best player in all of the Premier League), Eden Hazard, to Real Madrid for a fee north of $100 million; a transfer ban meant the club couldn’t use any of that Hazard money to match its top-six rivals in pursuit of another superstar; and former Chelsea midfielder and club legend Frank Lampard was brought in to fill the void left by Sarri’s departure despite questions about his tactical expertise.
This was thought to be a transition year for the Blues, but a quick glance at the table indicates that this isn’t a rebuilding year at all: Through match week 11, Chelsea’s youthful squad and inexperienced manager sit in fourth place, comfortably among the Champions League spots and 6 points clear of London rivals Arsenal. They have a 77 percent chance of finishing in the top four, according to FiveThirtyEight’s model.1 Chelsea, it seems, might just be the real deal — or at least some version of it. And though it took longer than some American fans might have hoped, Christian Pulisic appears to be firmly at the center of this exceptional young soccer team’s plans.
Pulisic’s Chelsea career got off to a quick start — the American attacker started in three of his club’s first four Premier League matches — but seemed to stall as swiftly as it began. Chelsea’s calendar got very busy between Sept. 14 and Oct. 2 — it played six games in just more than two weeks — but aside from one start Pulisic was nowhere to be found. Pulisic stans really began to panic when the kid from Hershey, Pennsylvania, failed to make the matchday squad in a Champions League game against French club Lille.
It was one thing for Pulisic to get overshadowed — and eventually replaced — at Borussia Dortmund last season by an up-and-coming world beater like Jadon Sancho; it was an entirely different thing for him to lose opportunities to old-timers like Willian and Pedro, each of whom has been around since Pulisic was in grammar school. A narrative was taking shape: Pulisic’s incredibly young Chelsea career had already reached an impasse.
But the narrative — as is so often the case — wasn’t that simplistic. Lampard told Sky in October that Pulisic’s summer workload with the United States men’s national team played a role, and he assured anyone who was listening that Pulisic was going to be a “big, big player” for Chelsea Football Club.
That patience is beginning to pay off. Since being left out of the squad against Lille, Pulisic has been featured in all seven Chelsea matches across three different competitions, scoring in his two most recent Premier League matches, including a hat trick against the usually hard-to-puncture Burnley. The goals are beginning to come, and the underlying numbers don’t look too bad, either — among forwards and midfielders who have played in at least five Premier League games this season, Pulisic ranks 10th in shots on target per 90 minutes, 19th in big chances2 created per 90 minutes, 22nd in take-ons per 90 minutes and 32nd in expected goals (xG) per 90 minutes — and 23 of the players ranked higher than Pulisic on the xG list are center forwards.

None of this should come as a shock: The quick and crafty American finished in the top 20 in the Bundesliga in big chances created per 90 minutes in two of the four seasons he played there. Pulisic fell out of favor with Dortmund coach Lucien Favre last season, but not because he wasn’t doing everything well — it was because Sancho was doing everything slightly better.
Because Pulisic is nearly as good at kicking a ball with his left foot as he is with his dominant right, there’s a not-too-distant-future version of Chelsea that sets up with Pulisic on the right wing, Hudson-Odoi on the left wing, Tammy Abraham up top and Mason Mount floating behind and between all three. None of those players are older than 22; the rest of the Premier League could be in a lot of trouble for a long, long time.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-seriously-should-we-take-michael-bloombergs-potential-2020-run/,2019-11-08,,,features,"Nov. 8, 2019",How Seriously Should We Take Michael Bloomberg’s Potential 2020 Run?,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Like any self-respecting election nerd, I keep a spreadsheet of prospective 2020 presidential candidates, which includes a column called “Odds They Run.” When a candidate declares, I move it to 100 percent; when a candidate passes on the race, I move it to 1 percent.
The reason I move it to 1 percent and not 0 percent is people like Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg announced in March that he would not run for president, but on Friday, he is expected to file paperwork to become a candidate in the Democratic primary in Alabama, as today is the state’s filing deadline. This move doesn’t mean Bloomberg is definitely running, however. At this point he’s just keeping his options open, although Bloomberg advisers told The New York Times on Thursday that he would decide for sure whether to run within a matter of days, not weeks.
Even so, Bloomberg’s move is a big surprise given just how late it is in the electoral calendar. (Since 1976, the latest an eventual nominee has launched his or her presidential campaign was August of the year before the election.) Now there are fewer than three months before the Iowa caucuses, and if Bloomberg does end up running, he’ll have to scramble to make the debate stage, let alone get himself in a position to win any states.
The reason, though, why Bloomberg is considering a last-minute bid is that he is reportedly worried about the way the Democratic primary is unfolding, as one adviser told the Times. Back in March, Bloomberg said he believed that it was essential that the Democratic nominee be able to defeat President Trump, and last month it was reported that he would reconsider his decision not to run if former Vice President Joe Biden continued to struggle. Presumably, Bloomberg has now changed his mind after seeing Sen. Elizabeth Warren — whose ideas, especially the wealth tax, he has lambasted as socialism — gain ground in the polls and Biden struggle with fundraising.
But there is arguably very little appetite among Democratic voters — donors may be a different story — for yet another presidential candidate. In October, a YouGov/HuffPost poll found that 83 percent of Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters were either enthusiastic or satisfied with their presidential choices. And it looks like there is even less appetite for Bloomberg specifically. According to last week’s Fox News poll, just 6 percent of likely Democratic primary voters said they would definitely vote for Bloomberg should he enter the race. And a hypothetical Harvard-Harris Poll of Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Bloomberg mixed in with the rest of the Democratic field gave Bloomberg the same 6 percent of the vote.
And those polls would probably qualify as good news for Bloomberg, given that he was generally registering around 2 or 3 percent in national primary polls before first taking his name out of consideration in March (which is also when pollsters largely stopped asking about him).

In a field this crowded, entering the race in the high single digits wouldn’t even necessarily be a bad thing, but the problem is that it might be harder for Bloomberg to build on that support than it would be for other candidates. In an average of polls from January and early February, I found that 62 percent of Democrats knew enough about Bloomberg to form an opinion (which was pretty high), but his net favorability (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) was only +11 (which was pretty low). As you can see in the chart below, Bloomberg was a real outlier — for as well known as he is, we would have expected him to be much better-liked, with a net favorability of about +35, not +11.

And history suggests Bloomberg’s low favorability ratings would be a major obstacle to winning the nomination. Our past research indicates that people who win presidential primaries tend to either be (a) already well known and well liked or (b) relative unknowns to start off the campaign. Only one nominee since at least 1980 has been in Bloomberg’s position (well known but not well liked), and that’s Trump himself.
Assuming Bloomberg does decide to run, where would he fit into the race? Well, as the former Republican-turned-independent mayor of New York City (he reregistered as a Democrat last year), he would be running as a moderate alternative in the Democratic primary. He favors liberal but not progressive solutions to issues like health care and climate change, and he can be downright libertarian on fiscal issues, like the regulation of banks and, of course, taxes. (It’s little wonder that he has denounced Warren for years.) That said, he has become a progressive leader on the issue of gun control, founding and investing millions in the group Everytown for Gun Safety, which has emerged as a powerful political counterweight to the National Rifle Association. Unfortunately for Bloomberg, though, candidates from the more moderate end of the party (other than Biden) have struggled to gain traction in the polls, so there’s a real question of how much support he can reasonably expect to attract. His candidacy may depend on eating into Biden’s support (which, ironically, could make it likelier that someone like Warren wins the nomination).
Thanks to his successful financial services and media company, Bloomberg will at least have money at his disposal (he has a net worth of $52 billion) to help him overcome his late start. It’s not hard to imagine Bloomberg doing what fellow billionaire-turned-presidential-candidate Tom Steyer has done — use his own money to saturate the early states with advertising and augment his state-level polling numbers just enough to qualify for the debates. However, as we noted when Steyer entered the race, wealthy self-funders don’t actually have an electoral advantage. For example, in 2018, we found that self-funders1 in congressional and gubernatorial races won Democratic primaries at about the same rate as non-self-funders did. And getting 4 percent in four individual polls (the polling threshold for the December debate) is a far cry from being in legitimate contention to win the nomination.
Instead, it seems likelier that Bloomberg will affect the race primarily because of the effect he will have on other candidates. For example, he could cause Biden to slip in the polls by chipping away at his moderate base or throw cold water on the ascent of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. He could also turn voters away from Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders by becoming the designated attack dog against progressive policies. Or he could fail to make much of an impact at all, leaving the current state of the race unchanged. We’re getting ahead of ourselves, though; it’s still possible he won’t run at all. Either way, there’s a long way to go before Bloomberg is a factor in this race.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

I mean, sure, the Washington Nationals just beat the Astros to win the World Series in seven games. But still, the Astros were your official Elo champs for the 2019 season. (Somehow I doubt the Astros will throw a parade or put up a banner for the honor.)
Because Elo takes a long view of the entire season, being the best in it is a pretty good proxy for being the best team in the league “on paper.” And it’s actually not uncommon for Elo’s Paper Champion and the team that wins the World Series not to be one and the same. Including Houston this year, it’s happened 28 times — or in a whopping 52 percent of seasons — since the late 1960s, when MLB expanded to a division-based playoff format. Simply put, baseball is a sport in which the best team doesn’t always win. (Or even if it does, maybe we don’t always know who the best team is anyway.)

*Using the version of Elo found in our “Complete History of MLB” interactive, which does not adjust for the quality of pitchers.
Ratings include results from all regular-season and postseason games.
Other sports have their own Paper Champs. (Although none happen anywhere near as frequently as in MLB.) I went back to the start of the Super Bowl era in 19661 and looked at the other sports for which we keep Elo — the NFL, NBA, college football, and men’s and women’s college basketball. Using the versions of our Elo that contain no adjustments for trades or players being in and out of the lineup,2 I found each case where the champion at the end of the season3 was not the team that finished atop the Elo leaderboard. Across all of these sports, these Paper Champs come up more frequently than you might think:
Since 1966, all but seven seasons4 (2013, 2009, 2005, 1998, 1989, 1979 and 1967) contained at least one Paper Champion across these five sports. Some years featured a lot more: In 2011, for instance, there were four Paper Champs — the Yankees in MLB, the Patriots in the NFL, and Ohio State (men’s) and UConn (women’s) in college basketball. (The only champs that actually led in Elo were the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA and Alabama in college football.)
In general, there is about a 50-50 chance that a given baseball season would produce a Paper Champ and somewhere between a 20 and 30 percent probability each of the other sports will as well.

What does all of this mean? Well, it could be that Elo is broken. Even though it is calibrated to be the best predictor for a team’s next game — given its recent form, long-term expectations, wins and losses, scoring margin, opponent quality and game locations — maybe there are certain aspects of each sport’s postseason that aren’t captured by the algorithm. (This is the “Billy Beane’s Shit Doesn’t Work In The Playoffs” theory.)
A fundamental challenge of forecasting is the balancing act between considering a large amount of information — some of which may be of less relevance than others — and a more specific one that is more relevant, but also more prone to factors such as random variance in a small sample. Our Elo models attempt to straddle this divide, but it’s impossible to find the perfect mix of information that works in every single case.
Then again, maybe the real issue is that playoff systems are too small of a sample to determine the best team. Perhaps the best we can do is be content believing the champion was simply one of the top teams in a given season, nothing more.
Still another way of reconciling Paper Champs to postseason reality, though, is to consider that most of these actual champions vanquished their on-paper rivals head-to-head along the way. When there was a Paper Champ in baseball, for instance, 46 percent of the time that team lost directly to the eventual champion in a postseason game or series. (See: Nationals over Astros.) In the NBA, that number was 60 percent; in men’s college basketball, 79 percent; and in the NFL, a whopping 91 percent. Although Elo still wasn’t convinced that the matter was settled afterward, the Paper Champ at least had a chance to make its case on the field or court.
And in most of the cases where things weren’t settled head-to-head, you only have to zoom out a little to find a path of head-to-head superiority between the actual champ and the paper one. Like in the 2017 NCAA Women’s Tournament, when UConn finished as Paper Champ … but lost in the national semis to Mississippi State, which then lost to South Carolina in the title game. Almost every disagreement between Elo and the official championship can be settled either directly head-to-head or in this manner — with the exceptions of a few pre-wild-card MLB seasons (in which the Paper Champ didn’t even make the postseason at all) and a number of older college football campaigns that underscored just how broken the sport’s pre-playoff system truly was.
In 2007, famously one of the weirdest college football seasons ever, USC was Elo’s choice, while LSU prevailed in the BCS. To find a head-to-head path that put LSU over USC, even if you open up the possibilities to include the regular season,5 you needed to follow a trail of four games: LSU beat Ohio State, which beat Washington, which beat Stanford, which beat … USC.
But at least the BCS existed by then. Before it came along, the 1970s and ’80s often required even more ludicrous daisy-chaining of head-to-head results to reconcile the championship. In 1976, the path from actual champ Pitt to Paper Champ USC required a string of five games. And in 1983, the chain went like this: Actual champ Miami beat Notre Dame, which beat Boston College, which beat Clemson, which tied Georgia, which beat Texas, which beat Auburn, Elo’s Paper Champion. No wonder college football fans clamored for a proper playoff (even if the one they have now could also probably stand to be expanded).
But even with the perfect playoff system, you can never really avoid Paper Champs. Random variance and matchups — plus a million other factors — will always cause teams to play better or worse than they look on paper. And would we really want it any other way? If we look at who would have benefited most over the past half-century if Elo perfectly aligned with actual championships, the rich would mostly have gotten richer:
Who has beaten their on-paper odds most (and least) often?

Although I feel bad for the Orioles and Indians, who would have won multiple extra championships if Elo had been perfectly predictive, other teams that have won plenty of real titles — Alabama football, UConn women’s basketball, the Patriots, the Yankees, the Spurs, etc. — “should” have even more under Elo.
Oftentimes, it’s the unpredictability of sports that make them great — just ask the Nationals. So we’re sorry, Astros. Although the first-ever Elo Championship pennant would be something to behold.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-a-blueprint-for-stopping-lamar-jackson-but-teams-arent-using-it/,2019-11-07,,,features,"Nov. 6, 2019","There’s A Blueprint For Stopping Lamar Jackson, But Teams Aren’t Using It",Michael Salfino,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"Stopping Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens is a chore. The second-year quarterback is on pace to throw for 3,626 yards and rush for 1,274 more for an offense that’s leading the NFL in points per game and rushing efficiency. That rushing total would crush the all-time quarterback record of 1,039 yards, set by Michael Vick in 2006.
While a New England assistant described Jackson as “a running back who can throw,” that running ability “opens up (throwing) avenues everywhere,” according to a league exec. That was the case in Week 1 when Jackson had a perfect passer rating against the Dolphins, tossing five touchdowns on just 20 attempts.
There is a cheat code for stopping Jackson, both as a runner and a passer. But teams are refusing to use it, choosing instead to defend Baltimore’s offense conventionally.
The code was unlocked by the Los Angeles Chargers in two games at the end of last season. If you key on stopping Jackson’s running, you risk overplaying him and opening up running lanes for the Ravens running backs — and that’s exactly what happened to the Chargers last year in Week 16. So it was assumed that Los Angeles would have little chance of doing better in a postseason rematch two weeks later.
But spurred in part by an injury to starting outside linebacker Jatavis Brown, the Chargers opted to defend the Ravens with seven defensive backs on 58 of 59 snaps. The plan caught Jackson and the Ravens flat-footed, and Baltimore averaged just 3.9 yards per play in the 23-17 wild-card round loss, well under the NFL average of 5.6.
When you’re more concerned with stopping the run, putting smaller, faster defenders on the field seems counterintuitive; adding defensive backs to the defensive huddle is typically a strategy for stopping the pass. But the Chargers approached the problem of Jackson with speed. “Lamar Jackson ran a 4.3,” L.A. safety Rayshawn Jenkins told Sports Illustrated. “We needed some fast guys, right? We needed guys who could run sideline to sideline and still help in the passing game if they got fooled. Not saying our linebackers couldn’t do it, but let’s be honest, DBs are faster than linebackers.”
It was widely assumed that this unicorn defense was the blueprint for stopping Jackson’s unicorn offense, in which the quarterback is the top rushing threat. And this particular defense also functions naturally as an optimal pass defense. In retrospect, it was clear that the more defensive backs were on the field, the lower Jackson’s play success rate was. The Chargers just took a strategy typically used on passing downs and applied it to every down.
Yet here we are at the halfway point of the 2019 season in a copycat league, and no team has fully attempted to replicate the Chargers’ winning defensive strategy against Baltimore.

The Ravens have faced seven (or more) defensive backs on just four plays all season, according to ESPN’s Stats & Information Group.1 And none of those plays came on first or second down.
Bill Belichick is famous for leaving no stone unturned in film study. And a Belichick trademark is taking away the team’s best player, which obviously for the Ravens is Jackson, a leading MVP candidate. But though the Patriots dressed seven defensive backs on Sunday night, they were all on the field on only one play, according to ESPN, while at least three linebackers were on the field for 64 of Baltimore’s 65 plays. Belichick deployed five or fewer defensive backs on 58 snaps. This more conventional approach proved unsuccessful. The Ravens’ offense scored 30 points against New England in the 37-20 waxing, including two scores on Jackson jaunts. Baltimore rolled up 26 first downs, nearly three times as many as the Patriots’ previously dominant defense had yielded per game in 2019.
Clues to why teams haven’t copied the Los Angeles playoff strategy perhaps can be gleaned from the Chargers’ postgame comments then. “It was a great job by our whole defense to buy into it, and that’s what (we) did,” safety Adrian Phillips said. “Nobody was selfish. … They just said, ‘Hey, this is the best chance we have to win.’ The coaches felt like this was the best chance we had to win, and we went with it.”
Maybe it’s one thing to do that in a do-or-die game on the heels of your standard starting defensive unit failing against the same offense. But it’s another thing entirely to bench your starting linebackers for a mere regular-season game.
So Jackson rolls on, into Week 10 against the winless Bengals, a team with nothing to lose except their ninth game of the season. They’ve even had a bye week to prepare for Jackson — not that a team needs extra time to find a way to stop him. The blueprint is an open secret, just waiting to be followed again.
Looking Ahead: Week 10
Best matchup:2 No. 5 Minnesota at No. 9 Dallas (-1), 8:20 p.m. ET Sunday
Two of the NFL’s best teams collide Sunday, when the Vikings visit the Cowboys for the marquee game of the week. Dallas appears to have recovered from its back-to-back-to-back losses of a month ago, coming off a bye to shellack the Giants on Monday night and bring its record to 5-3 on the season. Dak Prescott remains one of the league’s elite QBs in our Elo ratings, and the Cowboys have the most efficient offense in the league according to Football Outsiders’ DVOA metric. We give them a slim edge (54 percent) against a Minnesota team whose recent four-game winning streak was interrupted by an upset loss to the Matt Moore-led Chiefs last week. Most conversations around the Vikings usually focus on whether QB Kirk Cousins can play well — and how much his team even needs that — but the bigger question in this matchup might be on the other side of the ball. Minnesota has a solid defense, ranking seventh in defensive DVOA, including ninth against both the pass and the run. But Dallas’s offense ranks among the top five in each category, with Ezekiel Elliott running well and the offensive line re-emerging as one of the most dominant in the league. Anything Minnesota can do to slow down the Cowboy offense will go a long way toward determining if the Vikings can pull off the crucial road win here.

Game Quality is based on the Elo Ratings of both teams. Evenness is based on how close the game is to 50-50 pregame odds. A game’s importance is based on how much it swings the playoff odds of the teams involved. A game’s Quarterbacks are judged on the QB Elo ratings of the two starters.
Biggest playoff implications: Vikings at Cowboys
Potential shift in playoff odds: 30.6 total percentage points
The best game of Week 10 is also the most important one. Both Minnesota (67 percent) and Dallas (59 percent) are currently in solid enough playoff shape, but they can’t feel too comfortable because of pressure from tough division rivals in Green Bay and Philadelphia, respectively. A loss for the Vikings would still leave them with a 53 percent chance to make the postseason, but it would drop their division odds to a remote 17 percent. (A win, meanwhile, would bolster Minnesota’s playoff chances all the way up to 84 percent.) As for the Cowboys, they have even more to lose with a defeat here, as their playoff probability would fall to just 42 percent if they don’t beat Minnesota. This isn’t quite a “must-win” for either team, but the NFC is looking pretty cutthroat at the moment — with eight teams carrying at least a 40 percent chance of making the playoffs and, obviously, only six slots to go around. Whoever loses this one, whether it be Vikes or Cowboys, could end up looking back on it with regret.

Home teams are in bold.
The scoring system is nonlinear, so readers’ average points don’t necessarily match the number of points that would be given to the average reader prediction.
In Week 9, the readers claimed a nice victory when they banked on Moore’s Chiefs to give the Vikings more of a fight than expected. But mostly it was the algorithm’s time to shine. The week was highlighted by Elo’s outright pick of Oakland over Detroit — defying the prognosticators — and a variety of hedges toward potential upsets by the Dolphins, Steelers, Ravens and Chargers (all of which happened). By the end of play Monday night, the computer had crushed the typical reader by an average margin of 45.9 points, the most lopsided win of the entire season. Elo now has a 7-2 record against the field so far in 2019 and has won in each of the past five weeks.
Congratulations are in order, though, for Coleen C, who led all readers in Week 9 with 187.1 points, and for Aaron DiGenova, who took the full-season contest lead with 759.0 points.

Elizabeth Warren has kept gaining ground, and she’s now tied with former Vice President Joe Biden.” But the thing about narratives is that last month’s might not be true this month. (Never mind that last month’s might never have been true to begin with.) And while Warren is still doing pretty well overall — for one thing, her prospects in Iowa and New Hampshire look as good as or better than Biden’s — her standing in national polls looks like it has plateaued; it might even be a few points lower than it was a few weeks ago. She’s also pretty clearly trailing Biden.
First, let’s take a look at Warren’s movement in the polling averages over the past several weeks. We haven’t released an official FiveThirtyEight polling average of the primary yet (we’re working on it), but according to RealClearPolitics, as of the afternoon of Nov. 6, Warren was averaging 21.4 percent in national polls. That’s good for a solid second place, but it’s still comfortably behind Biden, who was at 28.6 percent. And it was a drop from Warren’s high of 26.8 percent, which came on Oct. 9.
The Economist is also out with a polling average of the primary this year, and while its average is a lot smoother (that is, less sensitive to individual polls) than RealClearPolitics’s version, it tells a similar story about Warren’s standing. As of Nov. 6, she was averaging 23 percent to Biden’s 25 percent, and the curve representing her polling average had turned slightly south after peaking in early October.
Another way to look at the primary is to group it into chunks organized around the four debates so far. It’s a bit rudimentary, but I calculated an average of pollster averages — I averaged each of the top five candidates’ level of support in polls from a single pollster and then averaged together those averages1 — for national polls in five roughly monthlong windows starting on June 1, which was about a month before the first debate.2 And my findings were the same: Warren steadily improved her polling average in each phase — reaching a high of 23 percent between the third and fourth debates — but has stagnated since the fourth debate. Her average for the most recent phase of the campaign is 20.7 percent, 7.5 points below Biden’s 28.2 percent.
(Most candidates’ polling averages have been quite steady, with the exception of Sen. Kamala Harris, who spiked after the first debate, in which she had a powerful moment attacking Biden on racial issues. Also noteworthy is that Biden has really not lost as much support as some media narratives would have us believe.)
We can also measure movement in the primary by looking at trend lines from individual pollsters — but again, they tell us largely the same thing: Warren’s support has leveled off and may even be ticking down.3 For example, Warren rose from 16 percent in Fox News’s mid-September poll to 22 percent in its early October poll, but she remained at 21 percent in its most recent survey, conducted just last week. And according to Investor Business Daily/TIPP polling, 17 percent of Democrats supported Warren in late July, 27 percent supported her in late September and 23 percent supported her last week. Quinnipiac offers the clearest trend, with Warren going from 14 percent after the first debate, to 21 percent after the second, to a high of 30 percent earlier this month, to 28 percent in the most recent survey.
As FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver noted over the weekend, individual polls are also in near-universal agreement that Biden currently leads Warren nationally. Of the 23 polls conducted since the fourth debate, all but two found Biden ahead of Warren — one poll showed Warren slightly ahead and the other showed the pair tied. (Although in roughly half of the polls where Biden was ahead of Warren, his lead was within the margin of error.)
All this, of course, raises the question of why Warren’s ascent has been arrested. Given the timing, it’s fair to wonder whether the fourth debate had anything to do with it; after all, Warren did come under increased fire from Buttigieg, Biden and others, perhaps due to her perceived status as a front-runner in the race. At the very least, it certainly didn’t seem to help her as much as the third debate, which was followed by particularly big spikes for Warren in the RealClearPolitics average, my experimental average and several individual polls.
More broadly, criticism of Warren’s lack of a concrete health care plan may have finally gotten through to voters. Both at the debate and on the campaign trail, she evaded questions about how she would pay for her “Medicare for All” plan until her campaign, tacitly acknowledging the pressure, released a more detailed plan last week. On the other hand, maybe it has nothing to do with Warren at all and just reflects other candidates holding their own or picking up ground. For example, some of the polls and polling averages show Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg ticking up a point or two in recent weeks; that support had to come from somewhere.
On the flip side, this could also just be a momentary blip for Warren. She has hit polling plateaus before (see her RealClearPolitics average in July) and they proved to be temporary. In particular, debates — with the exception of the fourth one — seem to lead to Warren upticks, and we’ve got plenty more of those ahead. So although Warren’s support has leveled off, it’s premature to say she has hit a “ceiling”; she may have plenty more support out there waiting in the wings.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

3,600 students scammed on Instagram
There’s another side to Instagram beyond selfies and influencers. The New York Times reports a digital media company called I’m Shmacked convinced more than 3,600 students to pay $45 to $500 to participate in a “college ambassador program” in which they would run affiliate Instagram accounts. Students were told their work on the social media platform could generate profits through a variety of sales channels, but many students have concluded they will never be paid or make their money back.

31 percent increase in depression
Millennials have been blamed for killing dozens of things, including power lunches and diamonds. But a new report from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association says significantly more people born between 1981 and 1996 are suffering from chronic health problems such as depression, hypertension and high cholesterol. Between 2014 and 2017, the rate of depression in this demographic — approximately 73 million people in the United States alone — rose by 31 percent. [Bloomberg]
640,000 metric tons of plastic
A new report from Greenpeace says more than 640,000 metric tons of lost and abandoned fishing gear account for the majority of the large plastic pollution found in the oceans. The items include nets, lines, pots and traps from commercial fishing operations, and the gear can kill animals. According to the report, abandoned fishing gear has washed up on Arctic coastlines and remote islands in the Pacific Ocean. [The Guardian]
2.5 million names
Every year, millions of high school students take the SAT and submit their scores to colleges as part of their applications. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that the College Board, the nonprofit that owns the SAT, has been charging universities 47 cents a pop to access test-takers’ names and personal information so the schools can inflate their application pools and rejection rates. All those rejection letters may break students’ hearts, but low admission rates improve colleges’ reputations as elite schools. [The Wall Street Journal]
3 times the generator sales
Disaster capitalism has come to California after utility company Pacific Gas and Electric announced it would implement rolling blackouts across the state to help prevent wildfires. A company called Generac dominates the home generator market, and its CEO said sales have tripled since last year. California is temporarily allowing sales of generators that don’t meet the state’s strict emissions standards, and NBC News reports that environmental advocates are concerned about the risks of increased pollution, carbon monoxide poisoning and fire result from the machines’ extended use. [NBC News]
69 percent approval
After a week that included a shooting at a Halloween party and a journalist at VICE exposing a nationwide rental scam, Airbnb was dealt another setback on Tuesday: a loss in a municipal referendum vote in Jersey City, New Jersey, a popular rental area close to New York City. Preliminary totals show that 69 percent of voters cast their ballots to preserve an ordinance regulating short-term rentals. The online rental company spent more than $3 million on the election, but it was a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of business the company does there: Airbnb said hosts in Jersey City made more than $16.7 million last summer alone.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-some-democratic-voters-reluctant-to-support-a-gay-candidate/,2019-11-07,,,features,"Nov. 7, 2019",Are Some Democratic Voters Reluctant To Support A Gay Candidate?,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"There’s nothing like a national election to illuminate the complex and slippery nature of bias at work in the country today. Just ask Pete Buttigieg. Always something of an underdog in the Democratic primary, Buttigieg has started to poll well in Iowa and New Hampshire relative to his national numbers and has proved to be a formidable fundraiser. But as his profile has risen, murmurs about how his sexual orientation might affect his bid have gotten louder and louder.
There are plenty of reasons, of course, why Buttigieg might struggle to gain traction among more voters. His lack of statewide or national political experience is one potential stumbling block. Voters of all races may also balk because he has faced criticism for his handling of the predominantly white police force in South Bend, where a white officer recently shot and killed a black man, and for implementing economic policies that some feel ignore or harm communities of color. And another scapegoat has emerged: Last month, a leaked memo described the results of a focus group conducted by Buttigieg’s own campaign in July, which found that some black voters in South Carolina were uncomfortable with his sexual orientation.
It’s hard to know how much that discomfort truly matters — even a number of the skeptical focus group voters were still open to supporting Buttigieg — and to the extent that it exists, it’s certainly not confined to one group. But regardless of the reasons behind his depressed support, Buttigieg’s candidacy is a case study in the dilemma facing gay and lesbian candidates running at all levels of office today. It’s remarkable, in one sense, how little Buttigieg’s sexual orientation has come up in the primary so far, considering that only 10 years ago, the election of a lesbian woman as Houston’s mayor was enough to make national headlines. Voters’ willingness to support gay and lesbian candidates is at an all-time high, and multiple studies by political scientists have suggested that Democrats are especially unlikely to discriminate against candidates like Buttigieg. “If anything, there are some subgroups of Democrats who would be more likely to vote for a gay candidate,” said Gabriele Magni, a political science professor at Loyola Marymount University.
Stop there, and you’d have a pretty rosy electoral prognosis for Buttigieg — focus group skepticism notwithstanding. But it also isn’t the full story. Some Democrats haven’t moved as quickly to the left as others on gay rights issues. And a substantial chunk of Republicans are still comfortable saying they wouldn’t support a gay candidate. As ever, it’s difficult to know what actually keeps a voter for pulling the lever for a particular candidate, but Buttigieg’s sexuality could be a sticking point for some. Experts like Magni said Buttigieg might find it tough to draw support from the most conservative or religious corners of the Democratic primary electorate, not to mention Republicans in the general election. And in a primary driven by voters’ concerns about how electable the candidates are, the perception that a significant slice of voters would never support a gay candidate might be an even bigger hurdle than the reluctant voters themselves.
Just a few election cycles ago, a debate about the electoral impact of a gay candidate’s sexual orientation would have had a clear answer — because being gay was a dealbreaker for almost half the country. As recently as 2007, only 55 percent of Americans said they would vote for a gay or lesbian candidate for president, which is only slightly higher than the share who currently say they would vote for a socialist. But many voters’ qualms about the prospect of a gay or lesbian president evaporated over the following decade, and 76 percent of Americans — including a majority of Republicans — now say they wouldn’t have a problem supporting a gay candidate for president. That’s still not the near-uniform level of hypothetical support the same polls show for a female or black candidate, but it’s also not obviously disqualifying. After all, only 63 percent of Americans say they’d vote for a candidate over the age of 70, which describes the three top-polling candidates in the Democratic primary.
There are plenty of signs, too, that a Democratic primary is particularly friendly terrain for a gay candidate. Political scientists have found in studies and interviews with candidates that gay and lesbian candidates overwhelmingly run as Democrats, in part because Democratic voters don’t seem to penalize candidates for their sexual orientation. A recent experimental study co-authored by Magni found that voters who identify as very liberal and nonreligious were more likely to support a gay candidate over a straight candidate.
The impulse to size up the electoral landscape and run where their support is strongest can partially help explain why gay and lesbian candidates often don’t find their sexuality to be a serious barrier. “When you talk to gay and lesbian candidates, they’ll generally tell you their sexual orientation didn’t matter much in their race, and that’s in part a function of the fact that they tend to run in more liberal areas, like cities,” said Donald Haider-Markel, a political science professor at the University of Kansas and the author of “Out and Running: Gay and Lesbian Candidates, Elections, and Policy Representation.”
But there are still pockets of the Democratic electorate where voters’ views of gay people aren’t as liberal. And that poses a few potential problems for Buttigieg, who has to run a national campaign. A significant chunk of his base is composed of white college-educated Democrats; this is also a subset of voters where his sexual orientation is highly unlikely to be a roadblock, given that several decades of data from the General Social Survey shows that people in this group are especially likely to say that homosexual relationships are never wrong.
But as my colleague Nathaniel Rakich wrote recently, Buttigieg has some fierce competition from Elizabeth Warren for white college-educated voters. And while the groups with whom he might be hoping to expand his support — like religious voters or whites with lower levels of education — are certainly not uniformly opposed to gay candidates, they are groups where his sexual orientation might be more of an issue. People who attend church frequently are much less likely than non-churchgoers to believe same-sex marriage should be legal, according to the Pew Research Center. Likewise, lower levels of education tend to come with lower levels of support for gay marriage.
Voters’ feelings about gay candidates could show up in more nuanced ways as well. The specter of electability, for example, could turn out to be a bigger roadblock for Buttigieg than outright hostility toward gay people. For instance, a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll found that voters were basically split on whether the country was ready for a gay or lesbian president, and only 26 percent said that their neighbors were ready.
To be clear, several experts told me these electability concerns don’t have a lot of evidence to support them, although that may be partially because there hasn’t been a lot of research on how gay candidates perform in real-life elections, and candidates may also avoid contests — like Republican primaries — where they’re all but destined to lose. But discomfort with gay marriage or homosexual relationships won’t necessarily stop voters from ultimately supporting a gay candidate. And Haider-Markel pointed out that the people with the strongest prejudices against gay people are also highly unlikely to vote for any Democrat, which means that in a general election, Buttigieg’s sexuality would probably matter less than the “D” next to his name. Dislodging gut-level intuitions about electability can be tricky business for a candidate, though. That’s particularly true when significant chunks of the electorate — including almost 40 percent of Republicans — are still perfectly comfortable telling a pollster they wouldn’t vote for a gay candidate. It’s hard not to assume that a neighbor’s stubborn opposition to gay marriage will shape their vote in some way — even though in reality, the forces that influence our choice of candidate are far more complex.
This complexity makes it nearly impossible to say for certain whether it’s Buttigieg’s sexual orientation — rather than his age, or his political inexperience, or his policy positions, or some ineffable combination of factors — that has kept him from rising further in the polls. And that will also make it hard to assess, when all the ballots are cast and the Democratic nominee is chosen, just how much Buttigieg’s electoral chances were affected by his sexuality.
But it also means that even if some voters are being held back by Buttigieg’s sexual orientation now, other parts of his biography, like his military service or Christian faith, could still change the way they think about him. The good news for Buttigieg is that there are months to go before the primaries begin, and he has plenty of cash to spend on introducing himself to voters who might currently know next to nothing about him. “At a very basic level, Buttigieg could reduce some bias just by getting voters to see him as a gay man who was also in Afghanistan and goes to church on Sunday,” Magni said. “Sexual orientation is less likely to play a role in vote choice when people move past the stereotypes they have in their mind about who gay people are supposed to be.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

That means your seasonal depression is settling in for the long haul, the 2020 election is a year away, and the Congressional Democrats are taking the impeachment inquiry into its next, very public phase. This week, some transcripts of formerly closed-door testimony were made public, and televised hearings will now follow.
Given that there are three months until the Iowa caucuses and the official kickoff of voting season — aka, political consequences time! — we’ve been thinking about the various ways that impeachment might affect each party’s 2020 electoral prospects. And there are a lot of them. So while we’re not oracles over here, we can already divine how this could end. Think of this as your wham, bam thank you ma’am primer on impeachment and its potential 2020 outcomes.
I) Things Are Bad For Trump And Very Good For Democrats
This set of scenarios imagines a black and white version of the moral-political universe: the American people believe Trump abused his power and they push to punish him personally and his party more broadly.
1) Trump loses everything: In this version of events, the public impeachment hearings become appointment viewing for the nation, attracting tons of attention and meaningfully shifting public opinion. The Democrats pull off the synthesizing of facts and narrative in such a way that a majority of independents and a healthy swath of Republicans turn against President Trump. (Right now, FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls asking about impeachment and removal from office shows 47.5 percent of Americans in favor, 45.6 percent opposed. Currently, only 11.1 percent of Republicans think the president should be impeached.) So much does the tide turn, in fact, that Trump loses his congressional allies and is forced to resign. Think Nixon. Mike Pence becomes president, but only for a few months; the public sees Pence as irrevocably linked to Trump. Like Gerald Ford’s eventual fate, but all sped up. Even sympathetic Republican voters stay home in key states, while key swing demographics move toward the Democrats. Pence loses the election and what’s worse, the GOP loses the Senate, as vulnerable senators are seen as having done too little, too late. Ouch. 
2) Voters abandon Trump but stick with the GOP: Congress remains split along partisan lines and few in the Republican Party end up pulling a Fredo on Trump. He doesn’t need to resign and stays at the top of the GOP ticket in 2020. But the televised hearings are damning to Trump — the public doesn’t like what it sees, and remembers that come November. The impeachment proceeding lowers morale among Republican voters who aren’t part of Trump’s hardcore base (the president currently has a 41.3 percent approval rating and a 54.6 percent disapproval), leading to lowered turnout particularly among reluctant Trump voters in key states. (We first identified reluctant Trump voters in the wake of the 2016 election as Republicans who had cast their ballot for the president unenthusiastically. This group tends to be better educated than the rest of Trump voters, though like most of the president’s voters, they are white, and middle-aged or older.) This scenario might look like the 2018 midterms, when independent voters went for Democrats by a 12-point margin. In this scenario, Trump loses the election but things are a little better for GOP as a whole; it keeps the Senate. Democrats get two houses: the White House and the House of Representatives.
II) Things Are Bad For Trump But OK For Republicans
This set of scenarios imagines a post-impeachment political landscape that has rid itself of Trump. The Republican Party is in a state of flux, trying to figure out what comes next after the end of an administration and party platform driven by a single, powerful personality.
1) President Pence: Impeachment hearings go really badly. The tide of public opinion turns against Trump and he loses his allies in Congress and is forced to resign. This scenario is a little like the one we started with, except with one key difference: Pence becomes president and wins the general election. He draws huge turnout from Republican voters who love Trump — the campaign charges them up about the unjust fate of Trump — while also reassuring reluctant Trump voters that he, Pence, will make for a steadier hand on the till. Currently, it should be noted, Pence has a net average approval of -5.5 percent according to a Real Clear Politics average; Trump is at -12.0 percent.
2) The Republican Civil War: The tide of public opinion turns somewhat against Trump, but not enough to shake the faith of leading GOP figures — Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham still watch the Super Bowl with Trump. But certain rebellious GOP figures are fed up and have had enough of hiding their concerns: Mitt Romney joins Jeff Flake (remember him?) in calling for Trump’s impeachment and removal. The moderate GOP caucus falls in line with these figures and the whole lot of them decide to throw their support behind the candidacy of Bill Weld, or, even better, back Romney in a longshot primary bid. They know they probably won’t win, but they siphon off support from Trump and lodge enough attacks for the president to be mortally wounded come general election time. He loses, and Romney et al finally settle in to implementing the 2012 GOP post-mortem plan to win back Latinos.
III) Things Go Very Well For Trump And Backfire On Democrats
Oops. The Democrats took a gamble on impeachment and lost. Their narrative doesn’t gel on TV; the details of the Ukraine scandal are too mired in diplomatic minutiae. People can’t keep track of the cast of characters. Who’s Kurt Volker again? Wait, what did Gordon Sondland do that was so bad? The Fox News apparatus proves to be a powerful story-telling voice for the president’s side of things, and Democrats can’t push their advantage.
1) Trump wins: The House remains split along partisan lines — nothing really changes after the vote to open the inquiry. Few if any Republican senators vote against Trump during his Senate trial. And after watching a whole lot of CSPAN-style television, the American public is divided over what they’re seeing, a la Brett Kavanaugh. (Republican support for now-Justice Kavanaugh only increased following his testimony while Democratic opposition ramped up.) The election is a squeaker. A combination of semi-ambivalent Republicans and low-energy Democrats — perhaps their base isn’t entirely thrilled about their nominee? — leads to Trump winning the election. The Democrats keep the House, the Republicans keep the Senate. Late night shows’ writer’s rooms get a little ‘70s retro, firing up the cocaine to fuel them through four more years of comb over jokes.
2) Utter chaos and destruction for Democrats: Congress remains split along partisan lines and the televised hearings leave the American public divided, a la Kavanaugh. Republican voters are angry, though. Really angry. The election is a squeaker but Trump pulls through, thanks to his enthused base, reluctant Trump voters and independents who think that the Democrats have led the country through a national pain in the neck for naught. (Independents are the real surprise, given nearly half of them supported impeachment in early November 2019.) The Democrats not only lose the White House, but also the House, as Democratic members from more moderate districts are punished for having put the president on trial. The Democratic gains of the 2018 midterms are all but completely reversed as college-educated whites from the suburbs — the Trump era’s stereotypical swing voter — make their way back to the GOP side of the dividing line.
3) The weird mixed-bag: The public hearings are damning but Republican voters and elected officials stick with Trump. Democratic voters nationwide are ready to dump Trump, though. Turnout on both sides is high. In certain key swing states, vulnerable Republican senators are ousted (a recent Morning Consult poll shows sliding net approval ratings for some Republican senators up for reelection). The Democrats keep the House, miraculously win the Senate and come out ahead in the popular vote, too. But in a re-hashing of the 2016 election, Trump wins the electoral college. The nation goes to bed confused on Nov. 3, 2020, and spends the next four years wondering whether there was ever any other way things could have ended.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

It’s still very early in the season, of course. On average, teams have played 7.4 games — or just 9 percent of a full-season schedule. Although teamwide stats will start stabilizing shockingly soon, it remains to be seen if some of the biggest early-season surprises on the player side will hold up as the long schedule grinds on. Here are the players whose performances have most over- (and under-) shot our projections from before the season:

The Suns and Lakers are maybe the two most improved teams in the league so far this year, so it’s fitting to see them represented on the “biggest surprise” player list. At the other end of the list, the Warriors and Rockets are among the least improved teams in the league, and a few of their players show up among the biggest disappointments. Some of these numbers will surely regress to the mean before long — or did you actually think Thompson and Will Barton will be All-NBA players this year? — but it will be fascinating to watch the leaderboards to see which aberrant performances do end up sticking by season’s end.
Whatever happens, as part of our rollout, we’ll now be updating player talent ratings in-season the same way we did last year — so players who show great improvement will have that factored into their RAPTOR projections as the season goes on. (And players who flop will be punished!) As a tweak for this season, we’ve changed the way we do in-season rating updates to account for a player’s age and experience in addition to his previous minutes, so young players will see bigger changes to their projections — and sooner — than they did last year.
As we wrote going into the season, we hope you’ll use RAPTOR as a resource all year long — whether to settle barroom debates about which player is better, or to figure out who is most responsible for your favorite team’s success.

His teams have competed in seven of the past 11 and won six, and the event has been a ticket to the College Football Playoff in each of its first five years. But on Dec. 2, 2017, Saban had the day off — from coaching, at least. That night, after Georgia beat Auburn to win the SEC, Saban called into Scott Van Pelt’s show on ESPN to stump for his team to make the playoff. “I think if the four best teams get in this, we’ll get a lot of really strong consideration, and I think our team deserves to be in it,” he said.
In 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018, the Crimson Tide won the conference title game and rolled into the playoff. But that one weekend in 2017, after a loss in the regular-season finale at Auburn, remains the only one in which Alabama ranked outside the top four of the playoff committee’s rankings since Week 12 of 2014. Saban’s wish came true, and Alabama snuck into the playoff. But if the committee sticks to the precedent it set this week, Saban could have more lobbying to do.
In the committee’s first rankings of the season, Alabama (8-0) is No. 3, below No. 1 Ohio State (8-0) and No. 2 LSU (8-0) but ahead of No. 4 Penn State (8-0) and No. 5 Clemson (9-0). Alabama has been its usual dominant self — ranking No. 2 in ESPN’s Football Power Index and winning every game by at least three scores — but Saturday brings its toughest test of the season: a showdown against LSU and its record-setting offense. If Alabama were to fall in this matchup, it’s harder than ever to see a path for the Crimson Tide back into the top four.
Granted, this predicament hinges on Alabama losing a regular-season home game — something it has done only four times in the past 12 seasons. But there’s reason for concern: LSU has been every bit as dominant this season, has already won tough road games at Texas and Auburn and has a healthier quarterback.1 The Tigers haven’t beaten Alabama since 2011, but they haven’t had an offense like this year’s in that span.
If Alabama loses and both Penn State and Clemson win this weekend — at Minnesota and North Carolina State, respectively — Alabama would likely fall out of the top four. And at that point, there wouldn’t be much time or opportunity for the Tide to jump back in. The team’s next two weekends will see a trip to below-.500 Mississippi State and a guarantee game against Western Carolina. Then there’s the Iron Bowl at Auburn, which would be the last chance for Alabama to impress the committee against a top-25 team. Unless LSU were to lose twice in its closing stretch against Ole Miss, Arkansas and Texas A&M, the Tigers would advance to the SEC title game and deprive the Tide of another such opportunity.
If the regular season ends that way, the committee will have an even more controversial decision than the Alabama case from 2017. Saban’s team would likely be 1-1 against opponents ranked in the playoff committee’s top 25,2 with five of its other six SEC foes currently under .500. Its nonconference schedule is similarly ugly: Duke, New Mexico State, Southern Mississippi and Western Carolina. Alabama’s current strength of schedule ranks 53rd, and history has not been kind to one-loss, nonchampion teams in that position — so much so that the FiveThirtyEight playoff model gives a bonus to conference champions. The 2017 Alabama team was an outlier, along with the 2016 Ohio State team, because of their overall body of work. But there’s no precedent for a one-loss nonchampion qualifying with one top-25 win.

With four weeks of the regular season left, so much depends on what happens to every other contender. Three SEC teams (LSU, Alabama and No. 6 Georgia) are now ahead of every team from both the Big 12 and the Pac-12. The committee showed some confidence in the oft-maligned Pac-12, ranking Oregon and Utah seventh and eighth, respectively. Then there’s Oklahoma, which just suffered its first loss at Kansas State. All three of those teams stand to gain if Alabama goes down this weekend, but they can also leave the door open for Alabama with another loss of their own.
Much of Saban’s case two years ago rested on the uninspiring competition: He told Van Pelt, “I would say that if we lost to a team in our conference that was not ranked by 30 points, that we wouldn’t be having this conversation,” referencing Ohio State’s 55-24 regular-season loss to Iowa that year. Saban also said, “We lost to Auburn at Auburn, which is a rivalry game for us, tough place to play. Georgia lost there by a whole bunch, too, a lot more than we did.” If history repeats itself, there would be plenty of room to gripe with Oregon’s season-opening loss to Auburn.
It’s likely that, for now, three playoff teams will be the Alabama-LSU winner, the Ohio State-Penn State winner3 and Clemson, which must only wipe out the rest of the weak ACC. If Alabama loses this weekend, the Tide can hope for some damage elsewhere — a second loss for the Pac-12 champion and perhaps a Georgia loss at Auburn next weekend — and then have a chance to back into the fourth spot. And the Tide could well deserve it, being a juggernaut as usual. After all, the 2017 team that Saban campaigned for ended up winning the national title.
No matter how November plays out, we could see in December exactly what the committee values, especially if it’s a choice between a one-loss SEC nonchampion, a one-loss Big Ten nonchampion, a one-loss Big 12 champion and a one-loss Pac-12 champion.
That might be the committee’s toughest ranking yet, and it would spark disagreement across the sport in any case. A scornful Pac-12 might argue that the playoff should expand and include automatic bids for every Power Five champion. In the SEC, meanwhile, nine of 14 coaches favor the current four-team setup, but leaving out one or two of the SEC’s top teams could change some minds. Saban said two years ago, “You want to get the four best teams in the playoff, and I think you got to look at the total body of work that the team did for the entire season,” and many would agree. But it’s not clear, for now, how the committee plans to do that.

†Total swing includes every team in the country — not just those listed here.
What, were you expecting a game other than this to be the most important of the week? With a potential swing of 54.6 total points of College Football Playoff probability on the line, Saturday’s Alabama-LSU tilt is easily the most earth-shattering game of the season to date. Most of that swing is tied up in the two teams directly involved; although this isn’t quite a playoff elimination game, whichever team loses will see its playoff odds plummet into the teens, while the winner would rise to about 70 percent. (Among outside teams, Georgia would see a not-insignificant benefit from LSU winning, presumably because the Tigers would be slightly easier to beat if the two teams met in the SEC title game.) A playoff probability of 70 percent isn’t exactly a lock, either — there are other tough games waiting on each team’s schedule behind this one. But for now, this is one of those matchups to slap the ol’ “Game of the Century” moniker on.
That’s especially true with Tide quarterback Tua Tagovailoa looking ready to go after leaving Alabama’s Oct. 19 game against Tennessee early — and missing the following week entirely — due to an ankle sprain. Tagovailoa versus LSU’s Joe Burrow is a battle between the nation’s best and fourth-best QBs, respectively, according to ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating, and the field will be littered with plenty of other talent destined for high NFL draft picks. With home-field advantage and a statistical edge on defense, we give Alabama a 63 percent chance of winning. But just as importantly, given the caliber of both offenses, this one should hopefully be a lot more fun to watch than the last two LSU-Bama games that looked as great on paper.

Riddler Express
Suppose I asked you to generate the biggest number you could using exactly three nines. Specifically, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiate or write them side-by-side. Given this challenge, 9×9×9 is a pretty good start — it equals 729. Better yet is just writing the nines side-by-side, giving you 999. The biggest number is 999, which equals 9387420489. If you were to write one digit of that number every second, it would take you more than a decade to write the whole thing.
Now let’s up the challenge: What’s the biggest number you can generate using exactly four threes?

Riddler Classic
This week’s Riddler Classic comes to us from Oren, who asked not to be further identified:
Now that Halloween has come and gone, your chances of getting free candy have similarly disappeared. Desperate for sugar, you wander into the candy store, where three kinds of candy are being sold: Almond Soys (yummy, sounds vegan!), Butterflingers and Candy Kernels.
You’d like to buy at least one candy and at most 100, but you don’t care precisely how many you get of each or how many you get overall. So you might buy one of each, or you might buy 30 Almond Soys, six Butterflingers and 64 Candy Kernels. As long as you have somewhere between one and 100 candies, you’ll leave the store happy.
But as a member of Riddler Nation, you can’t help but wonder: How many distinct ways are there for you to make your candy purchase?

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏 Julian, Peter and Rose Champkin, 👏 winners of last week’s Riddler Express.
Last week, six snails were situated at the corners of a regular hexagon whose sides were all 10 meters. Each snail was determined to reach its clockwise neighbor, and they all traveled at the same speed. But as each snail moved along, slowly but surely, the snail it was traveling toward was also moving toward another snail. The result was six snails — and six trails of slime — that spiraled inward toward the center of the hexagon. How long was each snail’s slimy trail?
As the Champkins noted, rather than looking at all six snails at once, it’s simpler to consider two snails A and B, one of whom (A) is pursuing the other (B). Suppose they start 10 meters apart, and they each travel at a speed of 1 meter/second. If B were moving directly away from A, then A would never catch B; instead, they’d always stay 10 meters apart. If B were moving directly toward A, they’d each travel 5 meters before reaching each other. But what about cases when B is traveling in other directions?
As solver Sameer Gauria observed, it’s all about how much of B’s velocity is in the same direction as A’s velocity. As shown in the animation below, the angle between A’s and B’s trajectories is always 60 degrees (that is, 360 degrees divided by the number of sides, six). That means B is moving away from A at half the speed with which A is pursuing B, since the cosine of 60 degrees equals 0.5.
So how does that get us to an answer? Well, if snail B weren’t moving, then A would travel 10 meters to reach it. But since B is moving away from A at half of A’s speed, A will have to travel twice as far — 20 meters — to catch B.
This math worked out rather nicely for six snails. Solver Beau Baker took this a step further, finding the general formula for how long the trails are for N snails, arranged in an N-gon with side length 10: 10/(1-cos(2𝜋/N)).
Just for fun, here’s what that looks like for 20 snails:
Slimy!
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏Chris Reedy 👏 of Bellingham, Washington, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic.
Last week, the sultan asked her vizier to present her with 10 candidates for marriage. The vizier searched the kingdom for the 10 most desirable partners but didn’t know whom the sultan would prefer. If she saw them all at the same time, she would easily rank them from 1 (the best partner) to 10 (the worst partner). But the vizier could only present the candidates one at a time and in a random order. Upon seeing each candidate, the sultan had to reject or accept him. If a candidate was rejected, the sultan could not pick him again. But on seeing each new candidate, she knew exactly where he’d stack up relative to the candidates she had rejected. If she strategized, what was the highest rank she could expect her chosen candidate to have, on average?
Chris solved the problem by working backwards from the end, starting with scenarios in which the sultan made it to the 10th and final candidate (presumably because she wanted to make sure she wasn’t settling with any of the others). At this point, she marries this candidate no matter what. His rank could be any value from 1 to 10 with equal probability, so his average rank will be 5.5.
Next, Chris went back in time to when the sultan was considering the ninth candidate. If she determines that his average will be better than 5.5 (i.e., your typical 10th candidate), she’ll do the math and marry him. If not, then she’ll reject him and take her chances with the 10th candidate.
Solver Scott Wu came up with a general formula for the average overall rank of the Nth candidate being considered when he’s the kth best among those seen so far: 11k/(N+1). (The 11 in the numerator comes from that fact that 11 is one more than 10, the total number of candidates that will be seen.) With Scott’s formula in hand, let’s return to the sultan’s consideration of that ninth candidate. If he’s the best one she’s seen so far (better than the eight she already rejected), his average overall rank will be 1.1. That’s impressive — she should marry him! If he’s the second best she’s seen so far, meaning only one of the eight rejects was better, his average overall rank will be 2.2, and so she should still pick him. It turns out as long as he’s one of the four best among the first nine she sees, she should marry him. Otherwise, she might as well pass on the ninth candidate and marry the 10th. Averaging all these cases together (when the ninth candidate is the best of those she’s seen, second best, third best, etc.), she can expect to achieve a rank of approximately 4.28 by the time she sees the ninth candidate.
Phew! We’re getting there. Continuing with this analysis, Chris found that when the sultan faced her eighth candidate, she could achieve an average rank of about 3.59. Working all the way back to the beginning, when the sultan is considering the very first candidate, the average overall rank of her ultimate spouse winds up being roughly 2.558, our final answer. All things considered, that’s pretty amazing — she’ll usually wind up with a top-tier candidate!
How does the math shake out if we change the number of candidates? Sure enough, the average selected candidate becomes less desirable, which makes sense — it’s harder to pick a needle out of a haystack as the haystack gets bigger and bigger. But surprisingly, the sultan still does really well for herself. The chart below shows how she’ll do when there are anywhere from one to 20 candidates.
But even with 100 candidates, she can achieve an average of about 3.6; with 1,000 candidates, that number jumps to a whopping … 3.83. Needless to say, this sultan must be an excellent judge of character.

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): All right, we’re back with a 2020 draft — but with a twist. This time we’re not interested in discussing who we think will win the Democratic nomination; we want to debate who we think will drop out next.
Already the days of a debate stage maxed out with 20 candidates seem to be a thing of the past: As Geoffrey wrote on Tuesday, only nine candidates have qualified for the third debate so far. So we’re interested in debating how the field will (or won’t!) winnow in the coming weeks.
Welcome to the first 2020 “Dropout Draft”!!!
The rules are simple: Three rounds (with three of us playing, that means nine picks in total) in which we pick from among the candidates FiveThirtyEight considers “major.” No 🐍 draft, because, well, that would be nuts. Whoever’s “team” includes the most candidates who drop out by the October debate (or by the time Iowa rolls around, if we want to be a bit more judicious and save face) will be the winner.
The order:
Geoffrey
Nathaniel
Sarah
OK, Geoff, you’re up! End our suspense and let me and Nathaniel know how royally screwed we are.
geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, elections analyst): OK, so my first pick is former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. He had just 13,000 donors at the end of June and is very unlikely to make the September debate, considering he also has just one qualifying poll (he still needs three more). Plus, he has an exit ramp available to him: running for Senate in Colorado.
And it seems like Hickenlooper might be open to the idea of mounting a challenge to GOP Sen. Cory Gardner. There’s also some evidence that this might be a good move for Hickenlooper, too. A poll released Tuesday found him ahead of Gardner, 51 percent to 38 percent, and another survey this week showed Hickenlooper leading the crowded primary field by about 50 percentage points.
nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): Good pick.
Yeah, Hickenlooper has resisted calls for him to run for Senate for a loooong time.
He even said back in February that “I’m not cut out to be a senator.” It seemed pretty definitive.
But then last week, he appeared to subtly change his tune when his communications director said “he hasn’t closed the door to anything.”
To me, that’s a sign that he may be preparing to jump ship.
sarahf: Do we think Hickenlooper is jeopardizing his Senate chances by continuing to stay in the presidential primary?
geoffrey.skelley: Sarah, he might be, but the Colorado Democratic primary field for the Senate race is crowded, too, with no obvious front-runner, and that is good news for Hickenlooper. It means he doesn’t have to rush to get into the race.
sarahf: And I guess with Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold ruling out running (she’d been speculated as a possible contender) … there really isn’t a clear front-runner yet.
geoffrey.skelley: Bingo. And maybe her avoidance of the race is a sign that she’s not sure Hickenlooper won’t end up running.
nrakich: This was kind of a silly story, but it was also reported a couple weeks ago that a firm that had previously worked for Hickenlooper registered domain names like “HickForSenate.com.”
geoffrey.skelley: Oh, I love a good domain registration story.
nrakich: None of these pieces of evidence is strong on its own, but in total, they might be pointing to something.
sarahf: OK, Geoff … so does Hickenlooper drop out before October? Or … before Iowa?
geoffrey.skelley: I think he drops out before October after failing to qualify for the September debate.
sarahf: All right, you heard it here first folks! You’re up next, Nathaniel.
nrakich: OK, with the second overall pick, I choose Rep. Seth Moulton.
sarahf: 😴 He’s still running?
nrakich: Haha, indeed. I’m a bit surprised that he is.
He didn’t even qualify for the first two debates, which every other major candidate without a good excuse (i.e., jumped in the race after the qualifying deadline for the first debate) did.
He’s almost certainly not going to make the September debate.
In addition, he reportedly had to let go of half his campaign staffers, indicating his campaign might be in financial trouble.
Finally, although he can legally run for president and for reelection to his House seat at the same time, it’s not a good look.
sarahf: Yeah, I imagine his calculus has to be pretty similar to Eric Swalwell — a House member who also ran for president but has since dropped out to focus on his 2020 reelection bid.
geoffrey.skelley: All this makes sense to me, though I wonder if Moulton might hang around awhile longer. After all, the candidate filing deadline for Massachusetts isn’t until May 2020, whereas Swalwell had a December 2019 deadline to worry about if he was going to seek reelection.
nrakich: I hear that, Geoffrey, but Moulton is also already attracting primary challengers in the Massachusetts 6th District.
And he was already catching flak back home after he led a failed attempt to deprive Nancy Pelosi of the speakership after Democrats took back the House in 2018.
So I think he’d be smart to focus on his House primary, which I think he could be in real danger of losing.
geoffrey.skelley: But when does he drop out?
nrakich: Yeah, the one thing that gives me pause is the fact that he hasn’t already.
But I would say soon — particularly if he is indeed running out of money.
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, hard to get people to work for you if you can’t give them a paycheck.
Now let’s see if Sarah will take my preferred next pick…
sarahf: Haha. l think I might get the first “bad pick” of the draft.
geoffrey.skelley: There are no bad picks … until there are bad picks. Lol.
sarahf: But first a step back to explain my rationale. I think there are two big groups of candidates when we’re talking about who drops out before Iowa.
You’ve got your unconventional, “never stood a chance” candidates like Mike Gravel, who simply don’t have the resources (or interest) to stay in any longer.
And then you’ve got your “also rans” like Swalwell (and Moulton), who I think could have held out until Iowa if they wanted to, but purposefully chose not to in order to avoid jeopardizing their political reputation. Like I wouldn’t be surprised if Swalwell mounts a Senate bid when Dianne Feinstein’s seat is up in 2024.
A candidate I think that falls into that category (although arguably, she shouldn’t) is … Kirsten Gillibrand!!!
nrakich: Outside the box!!
geoffrey.skelley: Now that is an interesting pick.
sarahf: She’s a talented career politician — she’s been in the Senate since 2009 and was in the House before that. And she maybe even picked up some momentum after the second debate (e.g., she now has one qualifying poll where she’s cracked 2 percent).
But to be clear, she’s still polling at 0.3 percent nationally, on average, according to RealClearPolitics.
So I think Gillibrand and her campaign are going to have some tough talks in the lead-up to October about her campaign and whether to fold it, because she’s got too many Senate colleagues in the race with whom she has close working relationships. In particular, I’m thinking Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, but even Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
And so if she stays in too much longer without earning more support, I think there will be a lot of internal pressure from the party asking her to drop out.
Now … if she makes the September debate, discount everything I’ve said. But I don’t think she’ll make it. And I’m not convinced she’ll hang around for the October debate either, even though the DNC has said it will keep the polling and donor threshold the same as the September debate. As I’m not sure how much those few extra weeks would matter to her.
nrakich: I think that’s totally defensible. She was one of my late-round sleeper picks.
geoffrey.skelley: On the one hand, I think Gillibrand has the resources to fight on. But on the other hand, she really might miss the September debate and maybe decide to pull the plug.
sarahf: I totally agree on the resources front. I just think she’ll care more about exiting when it’s still the “no hard feelings” period.
nrakich: To me, Gillibrand is the one candidate who was supposed to be in the top tier but who has flopped the most.
So she might be the Scott Walker of 2020 — the big-name candidate who drops out because it just didn’t come together.
geoffrey.skelley: Though at least Walker led the polls in Iowa early on. But yeah, Gillibrand has never caught fire. The fact that Gillibrand pushed for former Sen. Al Franken’s resignation over allegations of sexual misconduct could be part of it, but there are also just a lot of top-tier candidates in the race.
nrakich: She has an outside shot to make the October debate, as Geoffrey wrote yesterday. If she makes that, I agree, she’ll obviously stay in. But if she doesn’t, she’s not one of these vanity candidates like Steyer or de Blasio. She really thought she could win, and if things aren’t going according to plan, I wouldn’t be surprised at all to see her pull the plug.
geoffrey.skelley: Right, she’s a politician who wants to win office. She’s not running just to bring an issue or two to the forefront.
sarahf: OK, Geoffrey, you’re up.
geoffrey.skelley: Well, Sarah didn’t take my pick, so I’m going with Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. He’s already suspended his campaign once in the wake of the shooting in Dayton to return to Ohio, and he’s definitely not going to make the September debate. So I can see him dropping out by October.
Something to keep in mind with Ryan is that a successful reelection bid in the House is probably more important than sticking out the presidential race, as it could set him up to run for the Senate in 2022, when Republican Sen. Rob Portman’s seat is up, or for governor against GOP Gov. Mike DeWine.
I’m sure Ryan figured that a presidential run would help expand his name recognition and make connections for a potential future statewide bid. He’s routinely floated as a potential candidate for higher office, and with redistricting after the 2020 census, Ohio might lose a seat in reapportionment and put Ryan’s seat on the chopping block. Seeking to be Sherrod Brown 2.0 isn’t the worst strategy for an Ohio Democrat.
nrakich: Yeah, Ryan is an obvious pick … although personally I’d rank him below the person I’m going to choose next.
But Ryan did run with a clear purpose: He really seems to believe in winning back the white factory worker for the Democratic Party. He also doesn’t face pressure to drop out to run for reelection, because Ohio law allows him to run for both.
On the other hand, he raised less in the second quarter — and had less cash on hand — than any other candidate FiveThirtyEight considers “major,” so he may not have the option to keep going.
sarahf: True. OK, Nathaniel, you’re up!
nrakich: My next pick is … Washington Gov. Jay Inslee!
The debates seem very important to Inslee. He tried to get one debate organized solely around his pet issue, climate change.
Yet he seems quite unlikely to make either the September or October debates.
I’m not sure why he would continue running if that happens.
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, he’ll likely get the donors for September and October, but it seems unlikely he’ll get the polls he needs.
nrakich: Crucially, Inslee has the ability to run for a third term as governor in 2020.
But legally, he cannot be on the ballot for both governor and president.
And the potential gubernatorial field in Washington is in a holding pattern waiting for Inslee to make up his mind.
As a sitting governor, he is probably aware of pressures back home.
sarahf: Wow, two of the governors in the race out by October.
geoffrey.skelley: Inslee is a good pick. Once again, a candidate with some home-base electoral considerations. And as a governor who can run for a third term, that’s a pretty attractive alternative.
sarahf: When does Inslee have to decide if he’s going to run for a third term?
nrakich: The candidate filing deadline isn’t until May. But politically, that is untenable. He knows he needs to give other Democrats in Washington the chance to build up their campaigns before then if he’s not going to run.
geoffrey.skelley: Right. And this is a good moment to remind folks that a lot of states have multiple primaries: one for president and then a separate one for Congress or state offices. We’ve already talked about some states where this is true — Colorado, Massachusetts and Washington.
But there are also some states with consolidated primaries — their presidential and state-specific primaries take place the same day, which is the case in states like California, Illinois and Texas. Anyway, I mention this because the differences in filing deadlines can play a big part in the decision-making process for many of these candidates when it comes to deciding whether to drop out.
sarahf: OK, I’m up!
My second pick is less bold than my first but arguably more likely to happen, at least by October anyway — Bill de Blasio.
De Blasio always had a tough road ahead of him, and as much as I can’t believe that the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, stands more of a chance than the mayor of New York City, that’s where I think we currently are. De Blasio strikes me as a candidate who never really stood a chance, or wasn’t running to win — although, I can’t exactly tell you what issue he was running on, per se.
And the most damning stat of his candidacy was his popularity at home — New Yorkers don’t like him and didn’t want him to run!
It’s like if those at home, who in theory know you best, don’t like you all that much, why try to catapult yourself onto a national stage? Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was at least popular when he mounted his 2008 presidential bid.
nrakich: Oh, see, Sarah, that’s kind of why I don’t think he’ll drop out anytime soon.
De Blasio strikes me as the kind of candidate who isn’t really running to win, just to throw some rhetorical bombs and maybe have a good time.
So why let having almost no chance of winning the nomination stop you?
Reportedly, de Blasio doesn’t like his day job as New York City mayor. So I think he’ll try to prolong his presidential campaign as long as possible — to stay away from City Hall.
geoffrey.skelley: Resources could be a problem though — de Blasio raised only $1.1 million by the end of June and had just 6,700 donors. Yeesh. So yeah, I can see him leaving just because he can’t afford to stay in.
sarahf: Yeesh is right. OK, Geoffrey. Last round! Make it count.
geoffrey.skelley: All right, I think there’s an easy pick that I would take if we had four rounds, but given we only have three picks, I think I’m going to go for my sleeper choice: former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke. I think it’s possible that he might actually consider running for Senate again. He’s polling at 2 percent nationally with no obvious path for improvement, and he’s even worse off in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Not to mention that O’Rourke abandoned the campaign trail to go home to El Paso after the mass shooting there. So if I squint, I can see him deciding to drop the presidential bid for a more winnable race — at least in terms of his party’s nomination. At this point I think he would be much, much more likely to win the Democratic nomination for Senate in Texas than the presidency, and given his performance in the 2018 Senate contest, maybe he could even win the general. He’d be an underdog, but he’s been there before.
nrakich: Yesssss. I’m so glad someone chose him!
Mostly so I wouldn’t be tempted to waste my own pick on him. 😜
But I totally agree. O’Rourke has been home in El Paso helping his community heal. And that’s the kind of campaign break that leads to self-reflection — maybe the people at home are the ones you’d rather be trying to help.
To be more crassly political, it might also be a chance to step back and see that your campaign has been a pretty big flop so far — after you entered the presidential race expecting to be one of the four or five front-runners.
sarahf: Right, has anyone experienced a bigger flop in the polls?
nrakich: At one point, O’Rourke registered in the double digits — sometimes in third place! — in some polls right after his announcement. Now he’s at 2 points in the RealClearPolitics average.
geoffrey.skelley: Pete Buttigieg’s campaign really stepped all over O’Rourke.
sarahf: Right, and Nate wrote about this last month, but something tricky about O’Rourke is that his base (young, white, moderate Democrats) is smaller than you’d expect, so he’s running to attract a segment of the party that isn’t all that big to begin with. It doesn’t help that he’s faced stiff competition in candidates like Buttigieg or Warren in trying to diversify his appeal.
nrakich: O’Rourke also seems to be a guy prone to a lot of soul-searching. So if any candidate who has already made the September debate (as he has) is going to drop out for personal reasons before then, I bet it would be him.
geoffrey.skelley: And while he’s not leading in most Texas presidential primary polls, he still does OK, so I think he could successfully pivot to the Senate race. Anyway, I wouldn’t take it to the bank, but his leaving to go to El Paso really made me wonder if he might drop out.
sarahf: Good pick.
All right, Nathaniel, you’re up!
nrakich: OK, I’m going to go with the easy pick, then (thanks, Geoffrey!): Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.
sarahf: Ahh!! Stole my pick.
nrakich: Bullock will continue to face a lot of pressure from party elders (and even in his Twitter replies!) to switch to the Senate race.
He’s similar to Hickenlooper in that regard, although frankly I think Democrats’ chances in Colorado’s Senate race don’t change that much if they nominate Hickenlooper vs. someone else. Whereas in Montana, Bullock is legitimately the only candidate who can probably put that Senate seat in play.
Now, like Hickenlooper, Bullock has denied any interest in the Senate.
But maybe, if he doesn’t make the September or October debates, that will change.
He is term-limited as governor, so the alternative is basically to go home and retire.
geoffrey.skelley: But unlike Hickenlooper, Bullock would probably enter a Senate general election in Montana as a clear underdog against Republican Sen. Steve Daines. The state did reelect Democratic Sen. Jon Tester last year, but Tester was an incumbent and it was a favorable environment for a Democrat. And even still, it was close! Bullock probably wouldn’t have as favorable as national environment working in his favor.
nrakich: That’s true.
sarahf: OK, last pick!! This pick is also not that surprising, but it speaks to a similar trend of many of our picks (although, not all) — another lesser-known moderate in the party dropping out: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet.
He’s done a good job cracking 1 percent pretty consistently in the polls, but he hasn’t achieved more than that, so I don’t see his campaign catching on otherwise.
That said, there’s not necessarily a good reason why he’d be the next to drop out (no pressing filing deadline), but he also strikes me as someone who is going to approach this fairly pragmatically, so if he thinks he doesn’t have support, I do think he’ll bow out.
What do you make of many of the more moderate members of the party being some of the first candidates to go?
nrakich: Yeah, we didn’t name a single person of color in this draft, and only one woman! I think the “electable white men” are definitely the favorites to drop out soon.
geoffrey.skelley: Some of them were likely to be also-rans to begin with (Ryan, Moulton, former Rep. John Delaney), but the fact that statewide electeds like Bennet, Bullock and Hickenlooper are struggling probably has a lot to do with both the mood of the party as well as Joe Biden’s presence in the race.
nrakich: Right, at the risk of stating the obvious, I think part of what we’re seeing is there’s already a popular electable white man in the race sucking up all the oxygen: Biden.
geoffrey.skelley: Though I will say that it’s hard for me to see some of these guys being able to pick up Biden’s mantle if the former vice president weren’t in the race. The fact that they’re ideologically similar to Biden could help, but sharing the same moderate approach as Biden will only take these candidates so far. It’s not like all of Biden’s backers would just default to these candidates.
nrakich: Agreed, but that’s why I think it’s less about being moderate and more about being a white man/being seen as “electable” (which is probably related).
Like, de Blasio and Inslee aren’t moderate.
But I agree, Geoffrey — the field is so crowded that I don’t think any one of them would be doing significantly better if Biden weren’t in the race. Biden’s support would probably spread out evenly rather than going entirely to, say, Hickenlooper.
But even in that case, maybe someone like Inslee would be polling at 3 percent and would make the debates. So it could have made a difference for some of these candidates.
sarahf: OK, let’s recap. Here’s our teams. Who wants to vote first?
Who will drop out before the October debate?

I think I’m going to go with the safe pick here. Nathaniel’s draft picks seem the most likely on average to actually drop out before October.
nrakich: Yeah, I like my team. But I appreciate how you guys were willing to pick some dark horses! You should get extra credit if those turn out to be true.
geoffrey.skelley: I agree that Nathaniel’s team probably has the best overall chance to go three for three on dropping out.
nrakich: But let’s be real — will even two of these nine candidates still be in the race come Iowa?",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): All right, we’re back by popular (?) demand with our second 2020 “dropout” draft. That’s right, we’re not discussing who we think will win the Democratic nomination; instead, we’re debating who we think will drop out next.
On Friday, Former Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke became the ninth candidate to drop out since California Rep. Eric Swalwell dropped out in July. So now the question is: How many more candidates do we think will join their ranks before the Dec. 19 debate?
The rules are simple: Three rounds (with three of us playing, that means nine picks in total) in which we pick from among the candidates FiveThirtyEight considers “major.” No 🐍 draft, because, well, that would be nuts. Whoever’s “team” includes the most candidates who drop out by the December debate will be the winner.
The order:
Nathaniel
Sarah
Geoffrey
OK, you’re up, Nathaniel!
nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): I’d just like to take a moment to congratulate Geoffrey on winning our first dropout draft.
All three of his picks dropped out.
Who will drop out before the October debate?

Steve Bullock
Michael Bennet

sarahf: Hahaha, but technically two of his picks dropped out after the October debate though.
So …
nrakich: I think this draft is a lot harder, too, because a lot of the obvious dropout candidates have, well, dropped out.
But with my first pick, I choose former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro.
Castro is almost certainly not going to make the November debate — he has gotten zero qualifying polls, and there’s only a week left to qualify.
sarahf: Good pick (furiously reorders roster).
nrakich: And Castro got in this race to win — i.e., he’s not a John Delaney who’s just running for the heck of it.
So for a candidate like Castro (and O’Rourke before him), there’s really no point to continuing your campaign if you’re not in the debates.
sarahf: I mean Castro has essentially said as much — he’s sent at least one email to supporters where he’s said that if he did not qualify for the November debate, it would “be the end of my campaign.”
nrakich: He also has an incredibly high burn rate and ended the third quarter with just $1.1 million on hand.

His recent campaign moves (laying off staffers in New Hampshire and South Carolina) also suggest to me that he’s running on fumes.
Also… Just gonna leave this here… The filing deadline for the Texas U.S. Senate race is Dec. 9.
Now, Castro has said that he wouldn’t run for Senate. But, as John Hickenlooper can tell you, talk is cheap.
geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, elections analyst): Oh, that would be a particularly crazy curveball!
nrakich: On the other hand, he’d be a pretty natural VP choice for any of the current presidential front-runners, which could be a reason for him to just sit at home and wait by the phone.
sarahf: Oof, I guess that means I’m up.
I’m going with the other low hanging fruit out here … Sen. Cory Booker.
geoffrey.skelley: Oh! My pick. Dang.
nrakich: Whoa!
Interesting — I had him ranked seventh on my board.
This is a Gillibrand-esque pick, Sarah. Which probably means you’ll be right.
sarahf: Ha, I don’t know about that. But no matter how you slice it, this primary has not had a lot of breaks for Booker. Despite being a talented politician, he’s continually languished at what — 2 or 3 percent in the polls? Granted, he has made the November debate. But I do think making the December debate — while not impossible — will be a stretch for him with the higher thresholds (4 percent support in four national or early-state polls or 6 percent in two early-state polls). After all, he doesn’t have a single qualifying poll yet.
And similar to Kirsten Gillibrand, he still has a career in the Senate, so if it looks like he won’t make December (hitting that 4 percent threshold is going to be hard), I think he bows out. I mean, when was the last time Booker even hit 4 percent in a poll?
geoffrey.skelley: Booker last hit 4 percent in a debate-qualifying poll from Monmouth University in late August. He hasn’t managed to pull that off in a November or December debate poll yet.
sarahf: So tell us, Nathaniel, why did you have him so low on your draft list?
nrakich: I guess I didn’t realize how long Booker’s odds were to make the December debate.
I do think he’ll last another month, though, since as you said he’s qualified for November already.
And I think there are other candidates who will drop out first.
It’s worth noting, though, that Booker’s net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating) among registered voters in his home state of New Jersey is down to +5, per Monmouth. That’s a decrease from +23 last year!
Mind you, I don’t think he’s in serious danger of losing reelection (he’s up in 2020), but he might not want to keep letting that discontent fester.
sarahf: Eesh, yeah. OK, Geoff you’re up!
geoffrey.skelley: Hmm, well you guys took the top two people on my list:

nrakich: Haha.
I used pen and paper. Old school.
geoffrey.skelley: So unlike Castro and Booker, my pick is someone who may not be thinking about her political future: Marianne Williamson. And her exit comes down to money, in my mind.
nrakich: Yes, good pick.
geoffrey.skelley: She had about $700,000 in the bank at the end of the third quarter, and a burn rate of nearly 90 percent. This makes me wonder if she can keep things going. I know she has a lot of small-donor potential, but we also haven’t heard her campaign talking about passing debate donor thresholds in a while, either.
sarahf: It does seem as if a lot of the most likely candidates to drop out are the ones with money woes (see O’Rourke, Ryan).
nrakich: And she hasn’t made any debates since the thresholds increased.
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, the last debate she made was in July. She hit the donor requirements for the September and October debate, but didn’t meet the polling threshold. So it’s hard to imagine her making the November or December debate given that.
nrakich: Yeah, I agree — if Williamson wants to keep running, she’s going to have to run a leaner campaign. We’ll see how much her heart is really set on being president, I guess.
geoffrey.skelley: “Leaner” is probably a good lead-in to some of our next choices, I would guess.
sarahf: I’d argue she had Tulsi-Gabbard energy in terms of building a dedicated following, but I suppose her fan base had its limitations.
OK, you’re up, Nathaniel!
nrakich: With my second pick, I’ll go with my one pick from the last draft who’s still in the race: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.
The same reasons still apply: His campaign has not gained traction. He hasn’t made a debate since July. Eventually, you ask yourself, what’s the point?
And considering the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is probably whispering in his ear about running for U.S. Senate in Montana — where he’s basically the only Democrat who could make that seat competitive — there’s a strong argument for him dropping out soon.
Although he, too, has denied interest in running for Senate, I could see him pulling a Hickenlooper.
geoffrey.skelley: Democrats would certainly welcome that development in Montana. Election forecasters seem pretty confident that Republican Sen. Steve Daines will win reelection. Bullock entering the race could make things interesting, though.
nrakich: Yeah. Basically, he’s one of the few presidential candidates left with a political incentive to drop out sooner rather than later.
He’s not doing great on the money front, either ($1.4 million on hand), although he’s running a pretty lean campaign (he spent $2.4 million last quarter).
sarahf: OK, I’ve got a ~ risky pick. ~ Risky because she did just qualify for the December debate, but … Kamala Harris.
nrakich: Readers, Sarah has flown too close to the sun.
geoffrey.skelley: I’m not so sure, Nathaniel — Harris was higher than I expected on my list, too.
nrakich: Wow, outnumbered.
sarahf: Ha, Nathaniel is probably right. But hear me out! Harris seems stuck at around 4 percent in the national polling averages, and considering she once hit 15 percent nationally, it seems as if the trend for Harris after the first debate has been losing supporters. She was once fourth nationally, but Pete Buttigieg has edged her out, I think. And as Geoff noted in his piece on Warren’s rise in October, it’s possible that much of Harris’s support has shifted to Warren, as there is some demographic overlap in their support — both candidates have a fair amount of backing from college-educated voters and more progressive voters, meaning it could be really hard for her to win this support back, especially if Buttigieg does well with some of the same voters.

And similar to Castro, Harris has also been cutting staff operations, putting all her eggs in the Iowa basket, it would seem.
nrakich: So, here’s the difference for me between Castro and Harris. Castro’s decision seems to be clearly motivated by lack of cash. But Harris raised $12 million last quarter and had $10 million cash on hand. Her campaign staffing move doesn’t strike me as dire, but more so as strategic.
geoffrey.skelley: She’s only polling at around 3 percent in the Hawkeye State, though, so her campaign might be on the brink.
nrakich: But with all that money, Harris isn’t going to drop out for financial reasons. And she’s not going to drop out for debate reasons since, as you said, she’s already qualified for November and December. So why drop out?
sarahf: It’s a fair point, and obviously she’s in much better shape than some of the other candidates still running (cough, Joe Sestak), but I don’t think Harris has run a good campaign. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why, but I thought our colleague Perry Bacon did a nice job outlining some of the pitfalls of her campaign. Namely, I think flip-flopping on issues like health care has cost her — and with a field this large, any misstep can have pretty big consequences, especially if, as Perry notes, the field already has a lot of good candidates. And since she’s yet another Democratic senator who has too much of a political career left to stay in if it becomes clear that the party is coalescing around one or two other candidates, I think it makes sense for her to make an early exit — especially if this November debate doesn’t move the dial for her.
geoffrey.skelley: There’s certainly a world where President Trump wins reelection in 2020 and Harris is a leading candidate for the 2024 Democratic nomination.
nrakich: I dunno, I just think she still has a lot of potential — and a lot of runway to convert that potential into reality. I agree that it’s bad for her that she’s only stood out in one out of the four debates. But I think she has the talent to make another splash, and then she’s right back in it given her twin appeals to college-educated whites and black voters.
geoffrey.skelley: Fair point. Plus, Warren’s upward movement in the polls may be ebbing as she’s attracting more scrutiny as a front-runner, so perhaps Harris can take back some of the support she may have lost to Warren.
sarahf: It was a risky pick! OK, Geoff — you’re up.
geoffrey.skelley: Hmm, well, there’s one name left from our last dropout draft who’s still in the race, and I’m going to pick him: Michael Bennet. Similar story to Bullock in that he’s barely graced the debate stage and doesn’t have a ton of resources to keep a fledgling campaign going.
But unlike Bullock’s potential Senate consideration, Bennet isn’t faced with an electoral choice seeing as he was reelected to the Senate in 2016 and isn’t up again in Colorado until 2022.
And given the remaining names, I think he’s the most likely to drop out by mid-December.
sarahf: Good pick. I should have picked Bennet again!
nrakich: Agreed, Geoffrey. He was next on my board. Not a sexy pick, but he has a political career to tend to, and he can’t keep up a hopeless presidential run forever.
sarahf: He has gotten some interesting media coverage for someone who hasn’t made the debate stage in awhile, though. I thought this Politico piece where a reporter watched the last debate with Bennet was … a good profile for someone polling so poorly.
And I guess given Buttigieg’s success with his moderate pivot, I’m kind of surprised someone like Bennet didn’t do better?
geoffrey.skelley: Buttigieg is certainly more dynamic on the stump, and he’s got some interesting aspects to his bio that differ quite a bit from Bennet. Young, veteran, gay. Bennet, on the other hand, is sort of white bread.
Still, he’s only 54 years old and has a political future to worry about.
nrakich: Bennet is a conventionally qualified candidate, though. Experience in local and federal government. Son of a Carter and Clinton administration diplomat.
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, we may well hear from him again on the national stage. He’s a battleground-state senator, so he might be on a VP shortlist, depending on who the nominee is.
See: 2016 — Tim Kaine, Virginia.
sarahf: OK, Nathaniel, you’re up.
LAST PICK.
nrakich: I pick former Rep. Joe Sestak.
Now, I have mixed feelings about this pick.
Sestak by far has the least cash of any major candidate — $204,561. So you’d think he’d be forced to drop out any day now.
BUT, you want to talk about lean campaigns. … He has spent only $169,634 since May. So at that rate, he could keep going if he wants to.
geoffrey.skelley: I suspect his campaign apparatus is basically him and maybe two other people.
nrakich: Ha, right.
The question is just how long he is going to continue a bare-bones presidential campaign that has basically consisted of him walking across states and meeting with a handful of curious voters in each town.
geoffrey.skelley: Could drop out tomorrow and it wouldn’t surprise me. Could also stay in until Iowa votes and it wouldn’t surprise me.
nrakich: Exactly.
sarahf: Yeah, I agree. It could go either way with very little repercussion.
sarahf: Oof, OK, for my last pick I’m going to try and be a little more measured — Tom Steyer.
geoffrey.skelley: Ohhh, interesting. This is definitely getting hard after Sestak!
sarahf: Indeed. And I know he has made the November debate, and heck, with all the money he’s dropping in the early states (which is where all his qualifying polls have come from), there’s reason to believe he could make the December debate, too. His burn rate is high, but again, given he’s a billionaire who’s largely self-funding his campaign, money doesn’t seem to be an obstacle.
But! He didn’t seem to wow people after his first debate performance. In fact, in our poll with Ipsos, he received one of the worst marks on average — and sure, he’s got money to burn, but I think if he can’t inch up his national support by December, he’s got to see the writing on the wall and bow out.
Of course, as I think about this more, maybe he’s the perfect candidate to cling on and wage a campaign of attrition, but I like to think he’d take the Bill de Blasio route and exit quietly.
nrakich: I don’t know. In the “self-funders” category, I think former Rep. John Delaney is likelier to drop out than Steyer. At least Steyer’s money is getting him into debates.
Delaney, on the other hand, has loaned his own campaign more than $24 million total for the cycle and has nothing to show for it.
At what point do you say, “Hm, I think I’d rather keep my money”?
geoffrey.skelley: I don’t know. He seems dedicated. Delaney completed the “Full Grassley” — named for Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley — by visiting every county in Iowa, and obviously, he has a ton of personal wealth to keep him going, so who knows.
sarahf: Ha. OK, Geoff, if not Delaney, who??? LAST LAST PICK.
geoffrey.skelley: So, in my mind, there are three candidates left to choose from — Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang. None are very likely to drop out by mid-December. But I’d argue only one of them has anything to lose by staying in longer, and that’s Klobuchar. So she’s my pick, though I doubt she’ll drop out by mid-December.
I just don’t see Gabbard or Yang dropping out before her. Gabbard has decided she isn’t running for reelection in the House, and considering she’s no friend of the party establishment, it seems like she’s in it for the long haul. And Andrew Yang is an outsider pushing a pet issue — universal basic income — plus he has the Yang Gang propping him up, so I don’t see him leaving anytime soon either.
nrakich: Makes sense. But yeah, Klobuchar was way down my list because she’s actually just one poll away from making the December debate. And she may be experiencing an uptick of sorts on the heels of her fourth-debate performance, so I don’t expect her to just walk away from that.
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, it wasn’t an easy choice. I just had an easier time seeing her leaving than Gabbard or Yang.
sarahf: Fair enough! This was hard — so we’ll see how we do this time around.

Will Others Do The Same?,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"The Nationals ended a 95-year World Series drought in Washington, D.C., by employing a different type of road map than that of most MLB champions this century. The blueprint? Consolidate dollars and postseason innings into the best pitchers you can sign.
As free agency gets underway, there are elite arms available, including two main cogs of the World Series rotations: Gerrit Cole, most recently of the Houston Astros, and postseason star Stephen Strasburg, who opted out of his contract with the Nationals. Rival clubs could easily copy Washington’s plan this winter — it would just be expensive.
While most World Series winners this century committed between 10 and 16 percent of total payroll to their top-paid player, the Nationals spent 19.4 percent of their $197 million payroll (the league’s fifth largest) on Strasburg ($38.33 million).1 This is the highest share of dollars spent on one player by a World Series-winning club since the 2003 Miami Marlins gave 22.2 percent of its payroll to Iván Rodríguez, according to FiveThirtyEight analysis of Cot’s Baseball Contracts database.
The Nats’ second highest-paid player, another ace in Max Scherzer, was signed to a then-record free agent deal in 2015. He isn’t far behind Strasburg, earning $37.4 million this year. In total, the $75.7 million the Nats spent on their two aces represents 38.4 percent of the team’s payroll. Add in Game 7-winning pitcher Patrick Corbin ($12.9 million), whom the team turned to last winter after being spurned by Bryce Harper, and the Nationals spent 44.9 percent of their payroll on three pitchers.
The lucrative deals paid off in October. Strasburg had a postseason for the ages, winning two World Series games and accumulating a 5-0 record in the playoffs. Scherzer won Game 1 of the World Series and allowed just two runs in Game 7 against the vaunted Astros offense. Corbin contributed three scoreless innings in the series clincher.
The nature of play changes in baseball’s postseason. With more off days and more urgency, teams can spread work around by going to the bullpen or electing to concentrate more innings in fewer arms. The five Nationals pitchers with the heaviest workloads, in terms of innings pitched this season, accounted for 57.5 percent of regular-season innings and 70.3 percent of Washington’s postseason innings — the greatest share among teams in the postseason, and way beyond the MLB average in recent years. That group included rotation stalwarts in Scherzer, Strasburg, Corbin and Aníbal Sánchez.
Many teams have moved away from concentrating significant portions of payroll in one player, perhaps because of injury risks or the decline in performance often witnessed in 30-something free agents. But the Nationals bet on consolidating their resources in established, experienced players — the pitching staff is tied as the second-oldest in baseball — and it paid off. (Though it obviously helped to have a young star like Juan Soto delivering 4.8 wins above replacement on a salary of just $578,300.)
So will other teams follow Washington’s lead and pay more for top players? Those that are serious about winning may be ready to reconsider spending more. The correlation between payroll and winning this season was the seventh strongest since 1984, according to salary data from Baseball-Reference.com.
Notable pitchers who will hit the market this offseason include Madison Bumgarner, Hyun-Jin Ryu, Dallas Keuchel and Zack Wheeler. But the biggest by far is Cole, who seems ready to test the open market. Instead of wearing a Houston Astros cap after the Game 7 loss, Cole spoke to reporters while sporting a hat from the Boras Corporation, which represents him.


Gerrit Cole, an impending free agent, was resistant to talk after Game 7. 
“I’m not an employee of the team,” he said to an Astros spokesperson. “I guess as a representative of myself…” Then he spoke.
— Hunter Atkins (@HunterAtkins35) October 31, 2019

There could actually be a bidding war for Cole’s services, something that has been lacking in recent offseasons. Cole, 29, developed into an ace in Houston, coming off a season of 326 strikeouts and 7.4 WAR. He figures to have a chance to set the record for a free agent pitching contract, potentially besting the $217 million contract David Price received from the Boston Red Sox after the 2015 season. Scherzer and Zack Greinke, Houston’s Game 7 starter, are the only other pitchers to have exceeded $200 million deals in free agency.2
Strasburg could be close behind Cole in terms of top-dollar contracts. The San Diego Padres are reportedly considering making an offer to the Southern California native, who has been the eighth most valuable pitcher in baseball since his debut in 2010.
It remains to be seen if clubs like the pitching-needy Padres will try to follow the Nats’ consolidation plan. It can work — but it could cost them.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/national-polls-and-state-polls-show-pretty-much-the-same-thing/,2019-11-06,,,features,"Nov. 6, 2019",National Polls And State Polls Show Pretty Much The Same Thing,Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"A common refrain in coverage of the Democratic primary campaign is that the race looks much different in the early states than it does nationally, with a wider playing field, greater strength for upstart candidates such as Pete Buttigieg, and signs of weakness for the leader in national polls, Joe Biden.
The refrain is true if you look only at Iowa or only at New Hampshire, but it’s mostly not true overall. Taken collectively, polls in the four early states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — tell almost the same story as national polls: Biden leads, Elizabeth Warren is in second, Bernie Sanders is in third, and Buttigieg is still a fairly distant fourth.
There are some differences: Tom Steyer, who has poured millions of dollars into advertisements in the early states, is notably stronger in all four of them than in national polls. But Biden’s position is pretty much the same in the four early states taken together as in national polls. If anything, Warren and Sanders lose slightly more ground in early-state polls relative to national ones than he does.
Overall, among the nine Democrats who have qualified so far for this month’s debate, the correlation between national polls and early state polls (weighted by the number of Democratic voters in each state) is .99, or nearly perfect. It seems like perceptions to the contrary derive from ignoring South Carolina (a strong state for Biden) and Nevada (strong for Biden and also Sanders’s strongest early state) and their more diverse and moderate electorates at the expense of white and liberal voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Let’s look at some data. Below, I’ve calculated a polling average in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina using polls in FiveThirtyEight’s polling database. Polls are weighted based on their sample size and their pollster rating (please don’t hesitate to check out our newly-updated pollster ratings!). Because recent polling is a bit sparse in some of these states — and because the race doesn’t seem to be changing that much anyway — I’ve gone back and included all polls since the September debate, but polls since the October debate are weighted double. If a polling firm surveyed a state multiple times in this period, only its most recent poll is included. I’ve also calculated a national polling average using the same method. (All polling averages are through early Tuesday.)

The Iowa numbers do look quite a bit different than national polls, with Buttigieg much stronger and Biden much weaker. Interestingly, Warren isn’t doing appreciably better in Iowa than in national polls, perhaps because she loses support to Buttigieg (both are competing for white, college-educated voters). Sanders is a tiny bit weaker in Iowa than he is nationally. Steyer and Amy Klobuchar are slightly stronger.
In New Hampshire, some of the same patterns hold, although less profoundly. And Warren slightly overperforms her national numbers.
But Iowa and New Hampshire’s Democratic electorates are both quite white and quite liberal, which plays to the strength of some candidates more than others. It’s disadvantageous for Biden, who relies on a coalition of black Democrats and moderate, usually non-college-educated white Democrats.
Nevada, which is more working-class and more racially diverse, is a stronger state for Biden, as well as for Sanders, who like Biden does better among voters who did not attend college. And South Carolina, which has both a lot of African-American voters and a lot of moderate white voters, is a very strong state for Biden, as his polling average there (35.7 percent) more than doubles that of the second-place candidate, Warren.
Overall, if you weight the early-state polling averages by the number of Democrats in each state,1 they show Biden at 27.5 percent — similar to his national polling average during this period, which is 28.6 percent. Warren, at 19.5 percent in the early-state average, and Sanders, at 14.2 percent, are actually a bit weaker in early states overall than in national polls. And Buttigieg is at best slightly stronger in the early states; his good numbers in Iowa and to a lesser extent New Hampshire are counteracted by weak ones in Nevada and South Carolina.
The one candidate who really does appear stronger in the early states is Steyer, who averages at least 2.5 percent in each of them — but only registers at 0.9 percent in national polls.
Of course, Iowa and New Hampshire vote first — and could therefore affect voting in the subsequent states, including Nevada and South Carolina. But the media ought to be careful about implying that Biden is especially weak in the early states or that Buttigieg is especially strong in them. Those characterizations only hold if you look at Iowa and New Hampshire, which have electorates that are highly unrepresentative of the Democratic Party as a whole. Biden does just fine in the more diverse early states, conversely.
Put differently, there isn’t much evidence that Biden does worse with voters who see him up close and personal, as often seems to be the implication of coverage that focuses heavily on Iowa and New Hampshire. Instead, he does worse with liberal, college-educated whites, who are plentiful in these states. Intentionally or not, the intense media focus on Iowa and New Hampshire serves to give more influence to liberal, college-educated whites at the expense of African-Americans, Hispanics, moderate Democrats and working-class Democrats, groups that are also key parts of the Democratic coalition.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-score-election-victories-in-virginia-and-probably-kentucky/,2019-11-06,,,features,"Nov. 6, 2019",Democrats Score Election Victories In Virginia And (Probably) Kentucky,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2019 Elections,"There’s nothing like election night, with its twists and turns. And this year’s contests offered up a fine appetizer to prepare us for the multiple courses to come in 2020. We saw one governor’s seat (probably) change hands while another state handed full control of power to one party. Here’s what went down last night:
The race for governor in Kentucky is still too close to call, according to the Associated Press, but with 100 percent of precincts reporting, Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear leads Republican Gov. Matt Bevin 49.2 percent to 48.8 percent, or a margin of a little more than 5,000 votes. And Bevin told supporters last night that he won’t concede, which could complicate things and lead to a recount if Bevin presses the matter. But in a state that otherwise elected Republican candidates for statewide offices last night, Beshear’s possible victory is notable for Democrats, as it’s evidence that split-ticket voting does still occur.
Beshear claimed victory in a speech on Tuesday night, laying out his policy priorities as governor. Within his first week in office, Beshear said, he would drop Bevin’s plan to require certain Medicaid recipients to work in order to receive health coverage, which could have resulted in 95,000 fewer people receiving Medicaid. And he also vowed to follow through on his campaign pledge of restoring the right to vote to 140,000 felons convicted of nonviolent crimes who have completed their sentences — about 4 percent of Kentucky’s citizen voting age population. (Kentucky is one of just two states where all felons permanently lose the right to vote unless it is individually restored by the governor.) However, Beshear’s policy impact may be limited to executive action, as he is still largely powerless to stop Republican legislation. Both chambers of the Kentucky legislature are still Republican-controlled, and in Kentucky, a simple majority is all that’s needed to override a gubernatorial veto.
Democrats achieved an even clearer victory in Virginia, where Democrats now control both the Senate and the House in the Virginia General Assembly. The Democrats gained two seats in the Senate to take a narrow 21-19 majority in the upper chamber, and six seats in the House for a 55-45 majority there. With Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam already in charge of the commonwealth’s executive branch, Democrats now have a “trifecta” — complete control over law-making in Richmond, and the first time Democrats have had full control of Virginia government since the early 1990s.
This shift could have all sorts of policy implications for Virginia, too. One big-ticket item could be gun control legislation. After a shooting in Virginia Beach in May, Northam tried to push through legislation in July that included universal background checks on gun purchases and an assault weapons ban but the GOP-controlled legislature refused to take it up. Democrats could also take up raising the minimum wage to $15, as most Democrats in the legislature previously backed the idea. Democrats have also promised to expand voting rights, protect the rights of LGBTQ Virginians, improve health care affordability, and ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. And last but not least, Democrats could have the final word on redistricting after the 2020 census, though a pending constitutional amendment for a redistricting commision might alter how the state draws lines.
But, of course, not everything went Democrats’ way. Republicans salvaged the night by holding onto the Mississippi governorship. There, Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves defeated Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood 52 percent to 47 percent, with 99 percent of precincts reporting. But this was always considered the longest shot of the night for Democrats, with nonpartisan polls and election handicappers all agreeing that Reeves was favored. Still, a win’s a win, and Republicans will hold onto their governing trifecta in the Magnolia State.


What did all three of these races have in common? Well, at a high level, the results provided further evidence for a widening urban-rural political divide. In particular, Democrats’ successes on Tuesday (and we’re including their narrow Mississippi loss as a “success”) were driven by their remarkably strong performances in suburban areas. For example, Democrats’ gains in Virginia pretty much all came in suburban seats, and Beshear and Hood ran up huge margins in suburban counties compared to what the Kentucky and Mississippi maps looked like in 2015. And there was even more good news for Democrats in the suburbs in local races. We’ll take a closer look at those results in an upcoming article, in which we’ll explore the question of what these results mean for 2020.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clemson-keeps-making-the-playoff-but-the-rest-of-the-acc-is-a-mess/,2019-11-05,,,features,"Nov. 4, 2019",The ACC Is A Weak Conference That Keeps Winning Championships,Santul Nerkar,FiveThirtyEight,College Football,"In the midst of a blowout win over Boston College two weekends ago, Clemson defensive end Logan Rudolph saw a chance to put his mark on the game. After teammate Chad Smith ended an Eagles drive with a strip-sack of quarterback Dennis Grosel, Rudolph pounced on the loose ball, shrugged off a Boston College lineman and thundered to the purple-and-orange-clad end zone. The sophomore from Rock Hill, South Carolina, scored the first touchdown of his collegiate career, and the Tigers’ lead mushroomed to 45-7.

The lopsided score, along with Rudolph’s near-unaccompanied waltz into the end zone, is perhaps a microcosm of the modern Atlantic Coast Conference. Despite technically owning two of the past three national championships and appearing in four of the past six title games, the conference usually boils down to one team and “everyone else.”
Back in 2014, it was the Florida State Seminoles, led by Heisman winner Jameis Winston and a cast of other future NFL draftees, that laid waste to the conference en route to an appearance in the inaugural College Football Playoff, following the team’s national title in 2013 and ACC title the season prior. These days, the Atlantic Coast Conference might as well be renamed the “All Clemson Conference”: Since the Tigers arrived as national title contenders in 2015, head coach Dabo Swinney has led his program to absolute domination in the conference, going 36-2 over that stretch. This season, the Tigers are well positioned for a fifth consecutive playoff appearance, as our model gives them an 84 percent chance of making the sport’s final four.
Clemson’s best stretch in program history, though, has obscured the mediocrity of the rest of the conference. Clemson has mastered its opponents in the Atlantic Division, losing just once — to Syracuse in 2017 — and maintaining its hold on the division’s spot in the ACC Championship Game since the days of Winston and Company. Meanwhile, the Coastal Division has had no back-to-back winners since 2010-11 and has seen five different champs in the past five years. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Coastal Division champion has not won a single ACC title game since 2010, with its representative losing to Clemson in 2011, falling to Florida State during the Seminoles’ three-peat of 2012 to 2014, and then losing to Clemson again in 2015 through 2018. In some respects, the Coastal’s poor performance has seemed like a vicious cycle.

The Coastal Division hasn’t always been defined by chaos and weakness at the top. In fact, at the beginning of the ACC’s two-division era — after the conference expanded in 2005 — Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech commanded the Coastal, accounting for all division titles from 2005 to 2012.1 And in six of the seven seasons from 2005 to 2011, ACC Atlantic teams’ win totals against conference opponents fell within a narrower range than Coastal teams’ conference win totals,2 suggesting that, the Atlantic was more balanced than the Coastal at the time.
Since 2011 — the beginning of the Atlantic’s winning streak in the championship game — the relative separation between Coastal teams has narrowed slightly, while the gap between Atlantic teams has increased.3 The year-to-year excitement over the Coastal Division winner may have come at the expense of producing a viable contender for ACC hardware in December, let alone for a national title. If the Atlantic Division has been a case study in hegemony, the Coastal has been one in extreme parity — and ignominy.
The conference has also languished in terms of overall performance. Since 2011, the ACC has had just 23 teams finish in the final top 25 of Simple Rating System (SRS). For reference, the SEC West Division by itself has had 34 teams4 in the top 25 over the same time period. Granted, the SEC West is arguably the best single division in college football, but the ACC’s mark is the lowest of any Power Five conference over this period. Nobody doubts that the ACC is capable of producing a single great team, but if the conference as a whole were matched up against any other Power Five conference, it would likely get trounced.
The ACC’s struggles extend to its difficulty in producing top-tier collegiate talent. Since its inception in 2005, the Coastal has produced just eight All-American selections, the worst mark of any single Power Five conference division.5 But aside from the dynasty in Death Valley and Florida State’s three-year run, the Atlantic hasn’t been much better. The Atlantic has produced 36 All-American selections since 2005 and 26 since 2011, but the accolades have gone mostly to the two dynastic programs, Clemson and Florida State, who have combined for 24 of the 36 selections and 19 since 2011.
Clemson and Florida State’s apparent hogging of the talent also seems to track with recruiting ratings over time: According to 247 Sports’ Team Rankings, there hasn’t been a drastic disparity in the overall incoming talent between the Atlantic and Coastal Divisions. In fact, from 2011 through 2018, there was hardly any difference between the average recruiting ratings of the two divisions, though the Atlantic came out slightly ahead, with an average score of 203.65 to the Coastal’s 201.26.6 Once again, however, the year-to-year ratings of Clemson and Florida State stand above the rest of the pack, with the occasional exception of Miami.
So while Clemson’s current run is impressive in its own right — its performances in the College Football Playoff are evidence that its routine inclusion in the playoff is justified — it is arguably facing a slate of opponents that does not rise to the standard of its competitors in the playoff. Even Florida State, which is the only other ACC team to feature on the national scene in the post-BCS era, has gone through a lull since Jimbo Fisher left, and Miami has consistently underachieved relative to its incoming talent (which often rivals that of Clemson and Florida State).
As a Tiger, Logan Rudolph has only ever known the bright lights of the playoff. For him and many other Tigers, every snap of every game until late December is just a prelude to playing for another banner. But for most of the ACC, a basic truth persists: The stakes and the strength of the competition could hardly be lower.

Trump’s allies have talked a lot about the unfairness of the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, in which, as they tell it, Trump is a beleaguered defendant deprived of his due process rights. In the words of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Democrats have cut Trump’s lawyers “out of the process in an unprecedented way.”
The basic sentiment is that the president is being railroaded. But the reality is that when it comes to impeachment, there aren’t any protections for the president laid out in the Constitution. In fact, experts told me that pretty much any rights Democrats give Trump are above and beyond what they’re required to do. Trump hasn’t been charged with a crime and impeachment isn’t a legal proceeding, so he doesn’t have any of the rights you hear about on “Law and Order,” including due process. In the world of impeachment, “fairness” means whatever the majority party in the House of Representatives thinks it should mean.
This means the impeachment process is pretty much destined to give the president less power than he would like, and Trump is no exception. Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton also fought for their lawyers to have a bigger role in the proceedings, and ended up with the ability to participate in some way. Similarly, the impeachment resolution that passed Thursday did lay out some ground rules that include Trump’s legal team. As was the case in both Nixon and Clinton’s impeachment proceedings, when the process moves to the Judiciary Committee, Trump’s lawyers will be able to cross-examine and suggest witnesses and present a formal defense.
But unlike previous impeachments, the first round of public hearings will happen in the House Intelligence Committee, where Trump’s legal team wasn’t given a role, before the Judiciary Committee begins to weigh articles of impeachment. That might seem like a break from the past, but it’s important to remember that House Democrats don’t have a special counsel investigation to work from, and they’re still in the process of collecting and presenting evidence. That doesn’t mean that Republicans won’t get some mileage out of continuing to hammer the Democrats’ procedures as unfair. Impeachment may inevitably seem like something of a one-sided process — because that’s how it was designed.
Constitutionally, the president has no rights in an impeachment inquiry
It’s easy to see a presidential impeachment as something akin to a criminal prosecution — evidence is marshaled, a trial is held, and the president’s fate hangs in the balance. But impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. As a result, it has entirely different rules that make certain protections that are reserved for criminal defendants — like due process — irrelevant. “As a matter of law, a president has essentially no claim to any kind of participation in the impeachment process,” said Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri and the author of “High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump.”
To be fair, the Constitution is pretty spare in its description of how impeachment works. It gives the “sole power of impeachment” to the House of Representatives and the “sole power to try impeachments” to the Senate but it doesn’t say much more, beyond the fact that Congress’s power is limited to removing someone from office — a point the founders wanted to stress, since in England at the time, an impeachment conviction could lead to execution.
And there hasn’t been much elaboration since. The Supreme Court weighed in on the Senate’s procedures for impeaching judges back in 1993, but the justices ruled that the question of how the Senate was conducting its impeachment trials was a political one, and therefore beyond their power to decide. “The consensus was that it would take something extraordinary, verging on deciding the outcome with a coin-flip, to allow the justices to intervene and say the Senate was doing things wrong,” Bowman said.
Trump isn’t trying to take the House impeachment inquiry to the Supreme Court — at least, not yet. But Bowman said the bar for challenging the House’s procedures would likely be even higher, because it doesn’t have the power to remove anyone from office.
But presidents do typically get some protections 
Of course, there are both high-minded and pragmatic reasons why Congress might want to allow the president to defend himself from impeachment — which is why Nixon, Clinton, and now Trump were all given some kind of role. After all, Trump is not the first president to claim that he is being treated unfairly, and a straightforward way to deflect that kind of criticism and shore up the perceived legitimacy of the process is to give the president’s legal team a voice in the process.
The protections outlined for Trump and his legal team in the House resolution are actually pretty similar to the rules laid out for Nixon and Clinton, according to Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University who studies Congress. If the impeachment process makes its way to the House Judiciary Committee, which seems likely, Trump’s lawyers will be able to question and suggest witnesses, request evidence, and ask questions — just as Nixon’s and Clinton’s lawyers did before him.
All of these protections only kick in when impeachment moves into the Judiciary Committee, though — and unlike past impeachments, a significant portion of the action this time around will happen outside that committee. Importantly, Trump’s lawyers won’t be allowed to participate in the next phase of the inquiry, which will involve public hearings run by the House Intelligence Committee. But Binder said that made sense, because unlike the House majority in the Nixon and Clinton impeachments, Democrats don’t have a voluminous special counsel probe to draw from, so the next round of hearings are arguably the public distillation of the House’s investigation, not its case for impeachment. On a practical level, though, it means that Trump’s legal team likely won’t be able to get involved for several weeks — which leaves plenty of time for his defenders to complain about how he’s been boxed out of the process.
There’s one big caveat that didn’t loom over past impeachment proceedings. The resolution specifies that those privileges can be yanked at any time if the Trump administration doesn’t willingly cooperate with providing witnesses for testimony or documents. It’s a pointed addition, given that the Trump administration has so far issued a blanket refusal to cooperate with the inquiry, including blocking a raft of witnesses from appearing for testimony.
How the Trump administration uses its protections, of course, remains to be seen. Nixon’s lawyer was integrally involved in the House Judiciary Committee’s investigations in 1974, although Clinton’s lawyer’s main appearance in Congress happened toward the end of the process, when the articles of impeachment had already been drafted. The Trump White House, to be sure, is still insisting the entire process is unconstitutional, and it’s hard to imagine them changing their tune anytime soon.
But even if Democrats aren’t actually prepared to follow through on their threat to cut off Trump’s lawyers’ access to the hearings — which could appear to validate the criticisms of their process — it’s a reminder that they are decidedly in the driver’s seat. Trump might feel that the impeachment process is unfair, but if it is, it’s because the Constitution made it that way.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-2019-elections/,2019-11-05,,,features,"Nov. 5, 2019",Everything You Need To Know About The 2019 Elections,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2019 Elections,"It may not be 2020 yet, but today is still Election Day for millions of Americans. You’ve probably heard about the major gubernatorial and state legislative races in Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia, but chances are your hometown is holding local elections, too (check the website of your local elections authority to find out). Not only will the 2019 elections allow us to take the country’s temperature ahead of the knock-down, drag-out clash of 2020, but full control of state government is on the line for 25 million Americans. Here’s your guide to the biggest races of the day:
1. Two competitive governors races in red states
Two states are holding gubernatorial elections on Tuesday, and despite the states’ dark-red hues, both races are competitive. Due to a dearth of polling in Kentucky, it’s not entirely clear who has the upper hand: Republican Gov. Matt Bevin or Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. But the bottom line is that in a state as Republican as Kentucky — it’s 23 points more Republican than the country as a whole, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric1 — Bevin’s standing as an incumbent Republican governor isn’t as solid as the state’s GOP tilt might portend.
Part of that may be due to the fact that Bevin has found himself embroiled in controversy throughout his tenure, including fights with his own party. He’s fought with the Republican-controlled legislature over public education spending and with public sector employees over pensions. But he’s also repeatedly put his foot in his mouth, perhaps most notoriously when he “guaranteed” that teacher protests had caused children to be sexually assaulted because they couldn’t attend school.
Accordingly, Bevin is one of the most unpopular governors in the country. Even his own party is lukewarm toward him — earlier this year, Bevin only won 52 percent of the Republican primary vote. However, President Trump’s net approval rating in the state remains relatively high, so connecting himself to the president could pay off. Trump even held a rally for Bevin the night before the election in Lexington. Beshear, the son of popular former Gov. Steve Beshear, has tried to make his candidacy a referendum on the incumbent by going after Bevin’s efforts to add work requirements to Medicaid and criticizing his attempts to cut education spending.
And as mentioned at the outset, it’s hard to know just how competitive the race is because we don’t have a lot of recent polls. But established pollster Mason-Dixon found Bevin and Beshear tied at 46 percent in mid-October, while Targoz Market Research, which came on the scene during the 2018 cycle, found Beshear up 19 points — 55 percent to 36 percent — about a week after Mason-Dixon’s poll. In general, Mason-Dixon’s polling is closer to how election forecasters have handicapped the race. Inside Elections and The Cook Political Report both rate Kentucky as a toss-up while Sabato’s Crystal Ball says it leans toward the GOP.
The first polls will close in Kentucky at 6 p.m. Eastern; two hours later, we’ll start getting results from Mississippi, which is hosting the day’s other gubernatorial race. There, the two next-highest officeholders after term-limited Republican Gov. Phil Bryant are vying to succeed him: Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood.
Mississippi is another typically deep-red state, with a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of R+15. But Hood has a track record of beating those odds, albeit by diminishing margins as national partisanship has crept into state politics. He won election as attorney general by 25 points in 2003, by 20 points in 2007, by 22 points in 2011 and by 11 points in 2015. Following that playbook, Hood has made conservative talking points like gun ownership and lower taxes a central part of his campaign. But he’s also trying to use health care as a way to reach Republicans who voted for Reeves’s primary opponent, former Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller Jr., who supported Medicaid expansion and actually refused to endorse Reeves after the primary. Reeves is countering by trying to tie Hood to national Democrats and paint him as an opponent of Trump, who is still popular in Mississippi (54 percent of Mississippians approve of Trump’s job performance and 42 percent disapprove, according to a recent Mason-Dixon poll). And as Trump did in Kentucky, he held a rally for Reeves in Tupelo on Friday night.
In general, handicappers agree that the race leans Republican. Reeves has outspent Hood $10.8 million to $5.2 million, with three recent polls giving Reeves anywhere from a 1- to a 7-point lead.2 But even if Hood manages to win the popular vote, that might not be enough to win the governorship. That’s because the Mississippi Constitution requires that winning candidates carry a majority of both the popular vote and Mississippi’s 122 state House districts. Otherwise, the state House will decide the winner, and given the chamber’s composition (74 Republicans and 44 Democrats3), it could vote to install Reeves should it come to this. The law is being challenged in court, and although a federal judge on Friday declined to strike it down before the election, he said that he would reconsider it if it affects the outcome of the election.
There is one more gubernatorial race later this year (Louisiana on Nov. 16), but the Kentucky and Mississippi races alone will test just how nationalized state politics has become. Will voters focus on the personalities of the candidates on the ballot, or will Republicans’ — and Trump’s — strength in these two states be all that matters?
2. One legislature that could flip
There’s even more action down-ballot on Tuesday as Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia hold contests for their state legislatures. There are a few additional special legislative elections around the country. But only in Virginia, where all 140 seats in the General Assembly are up for grabs, is party control of the legislature truly in play. If Democrats win both the Senate and the House of Delegates, this would be the first time Democrats have had full control of Virginia government since the early 1990s.
In the Senate, Republicans hold a 21-19 seat advantage, meaning Democrats need two seats for outright control.4 The GOP also has a two-seat edge (51-49) in the House of Delegates, meaning Democrats also need to pick up two seats here for a majority.5 The Senate, at least, looks likely to go Democratic, as Republicans are defending four seats in districts Hillary Clinton carried while Democrats are defending zero Trump-won seats. Democrats are favored to some degree in the House, too, but the GOP could surprise there with a number of strong Republican incumbents on the ballot. Still, court-ordered redistricting earlier this year changed the partisan makeup of 25 House seats, and the map seems likely to help Democrats — the number of Clinton-won seats increased from 51 to 56. Democrats also have outraised Republicans for the first time in an off-off-year since 2007.
Back in early 2019, the personal scandals embroiling Gov. Ralph Northam, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring — all Democrats — may have made it hard to believe Democrats would have the electoral edge in November. Yet two statewide polls found Democrats up by 7 or more points among registered or likely voters (although a survey of adults found Democrats up by just 1 point). And a poll testing four key Senate races found Democrats up 14 points on the generic ballot among likely voters.
While these polls seem at odds with the Democratic scandals, the likely explanation is Trump remains unpopular in the commonwealth. As of September, his net approval rating in Virginia was -6, according to Morning Consult, with a disapproval rating above 50 percent. And dislike for the president has already twice boosted Democrats in Virginia — a backlash to Trump helped Democrats sweep all three statewide offices and gain 15 seats in the House of Delegates in 2017, then Democrats picked up three U.S. House seats last fall. All in all, national forces could be outweighing local considerations in Virginia. And as with any election, turnout will be important, so be sure to check out the Washington Post’s live turnout model, which will estimate how many votes are left to count tonight.
Outside Virginia, there’s one state legislative contest that’s also worth your attention: a special election in Texas state House District 28. Trump carried it by 10 points in 2016, significantly down from Mitt Romney’s 30-point advantage there in 2012, and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz only carried it by 3 points in the state’s 2018 Senate race. So for Democrats hoping to turn Texas blue — and Republicans hoping to hold on to power — this seat is considered a bellwether of sorts.
3. Six ballot measures to watch
Finally, some states and cities could directly change policies through ballot measures, the consequences of which could reverberate far beyond their constituencies. For example, if Ballot Question 1 passes in New York City, it would represent the second big leap forward in two years for the ranked-choice voting movement.6 With 8.4 million people, New York City would be the largest jurisdiction to implement ranked-choice voting, after Maine (1.3 million people) did so last year. If Ballot Question 1 passes, it could help ranked-choice voting enter the mainstream through its use in the wide-open 2021 mayoral election, which will likely get national news coverage. Then again, if Ballot Question 1 passes but is implemented poorly, it could also set the movement back substantially.
Two ballot measures out west deal with the hot topics of discrimination and immigration. In Washington, Referendum 88 would backtrack from the state’s 1998 ban on affirmative action and allow the state to use race, sex, ethnicity, national origin, age, disability or veteran status as one of many factors in hiring, education and contracting decisions. And via Proposition 205, voters in Tucson will decide whether to become Arizona’s first sanctuary city. However, the proposal might have a hard road ahead of it, as politicians of both parties — including the city’s Democratic mayor — have come out against it.
Lastly, a lot of money is at stake in today’s elections. A couple measures in Colorado would significantly weaken the state’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights, a 1990s-era conservative policy experiment that requires that state revenue above a certain amount be returned to taxpayers. But if Colorado liberals succeed in passing Proposition CC, that revenue — estimated at more than $300 million a year — could be retained to fund transportation and education. Meanwhile, Proposition DD would raise money for the state’s water plan by legalizing and taxing sports betting, which would make Colorado the 14th state to do so since the Supreme Court ruled the federal ban on commercial sports betting unconstitutional in 2018. On the conservative side, Texas’s Proposition 4 would create a state constitutional amendment against an individual income tax. Although Texas currently has no income tax, Proposition 4 would make it harder to enact one in the future because it would require another constitutional amendment, which requires a two-thirds vote by the state legislature and approval in a statewide referendum. This could help Republicans retain veto power over a Texas income tax even if Texas eventually turns blue and Democrats control the legislature.



And if you’re a connoisseur of local elections, that’s just scratching the surface. No fewer than 39 states will host elections of some kind, choosing everything from mayors to attorneys general to county executives to district attorneys. We recommend the blogs Daily Kos Elections (on the left) and Red Racing Horses (on the right) for coverage that goes way deeper than you ever knew you wanted to go.

The nearly completed Week 9 saw a win for the Dolphins, a loss for the Patriots and FOUR losses for the NFC North.
Let’s dive right in: Anyone surprised that Baltimore took down New England?
neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): A little bit. There was a stat floating around that Bill Belichick had won 21 straight games against QBs in their rookie or second NFL seasons.
And yet, Lamar Jackson had the best game of the week according to our QB Elo! His development this season continues to be incredible.
Salfino (Michael Salfino, FiveThirtyEight contributor): I was not surprised. The Ravens are a unicorn team that’s tough to prepare for and impossible to tailor a roster to stop. Most teams can’t replicate the Chargers’ plan during the playoffs last year, borne out of injury desperation, to play seven defensive backs on base downs. Plus you have a very vanilla Patriots offense in terms of skill talent with a QB who is playing well for a 42 year old, but, let’s be real, is having quantifiably his worst season since at least 2006 (in terms of QBR).
joshua.hermsmeyer (Josh Hermsmeyer, NFL analyst): I don’t think the Ravens feared the Patriots offense, and as Mike said, they have a scheme and roster that can give a defense fits — even a defense as outrageously good as New England’s has been. They also executed their plan perfectly. One play sticks out to me: the Marquise “Hollywood” Brown jet motion pitch play:

https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/brown-play.mp4
It had all the components of the offensive strategy: Make New England account for Lamar, use misdirection and really lean on some great blocking
Salfino: Lamar — with two rushing TDs and 61 yards rushing on Sunday — continues after Week 1 to score more fantasy points with his legs than with his arm, which is extremely unusual. He did it last year, too. Only Bobby Douglass of the Bears (1972, 1973) has repeated this feat since the AFL-NFL merger was completed in 1970, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com.
I do think that it’s a bad break for the Ravens that they had to face the Patriots in the regular season. You wanted this to be the playoff game.
sara.ziegler: The Ravens got off to such a strong start that it seemed to shell-shock the Pats a little. I was still surprised New England didn’t make it all the way back.
neil: Especially once the Ravens gifted the Pats the ball on that muffed punt — that felt like a here we go moment, where the Pats would start their climb back. And NE got within 4 points, but the Ravens kept answering in the second half.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Fumble luck regression really helped.
Salfino: That kind of stuff never happens to New England. The Patriots have committed only 13 turnovers that resulted in the opposing defense returning the ball for a TD since 2010.
sara.ziegler: It was also interesting to me that Belichick was faced with a fourth down on the opponent’s side of the field and chose to punt, and he had a fourth-and-goal from the one and kicked a field goal.
The Ravens went for it on fourth down in the fourth quarter, got the first down and then a touchdown on that drive, and that put it away.
Salfino: Well, Belichick doesn’t believe in analytics, Sara.
sara.ziegler: LOL
joshua.hermsmeyer: “Less than zero”
sara.ziegler: Just more evidence we can add to the pile!
Salfino: Belichick uses Bret Easton Ellis’s analytics. Or Elvis Costello’s, if you prefer.
neil: And his aim is usually so true!
sara.ziegler: 🤣🤣🤣
Salfino: Awesome, Neil.
sara.ziegler: From one analytics move to another, what did you all think about the Chargers **taking points off the board** against the Packers?? Green Bay stopped Los Angeles on the 2-yard line but jumped offsides on the field goal attempt, giving the Chargers another fourth down. L.A. coach Anthony Lynn pulled the field goal unit off the field, sent his offense back out and Melvin Gordon ran it in for a TD.
Salfino: The game was over, so I like the macho move to make a point.
Lynn can build a whole narrative around that now, and it was not going to cost him anything. So, worth it.
sara.ziegler: But … giving Aaron Rodgers an opening?!?!?!?
Salfino: Rodgers was hopeless before the “home crowd” in Los Angeles.
joshua.hermsmeyer: It’s not always “correct” to be aggressive, but you’ll be right far more often than wrong if it’s your default mentality. For that reason alone, I liked the call.
Salfino: But wasn’t that free money, Josh?
joshua.hermsmeyer: I haven’t looked it up, but my intuition is yes, it was a no-brainer.
sara.ziegler: I liked the call too, though up just two touchdowns with 10 minutes to go against Rodgers doesn’t seem like a situation where the game is put away.
neil: Maybe given the Chargers’ difficulty actually closing out opponents, though, you’d think they’d be skittish about giving somebody like Rodgers a potential opening.
Salfino: Yes, but Neil, you are forgetting the Chargers rules. They shock us by falling out of the playoff race and then shock us again by charging back into it (almost). This is part two of their annual metamorphosis. I refuse to be played again.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I am fairly sure based on discussions with analytics people around the league that the Chargers are not a team that has a chart and uses it. So I think the touchdown call was all gut, and on those terms I agree with it.
Salfino: It’s good that the Chargers reject analytics, otherwise they would be mentally crushed by all the win probability they have frittered away.
sara.ziegler: If the Chargers don’t get the TD there, and the Packers answer with a touchdown, you can see things falling apart fast!
This is why these questions are interesting, right?
joshua.hermsmeyer: I’d look at it as if it had been a great punt instead and just get after Rodgers at his own 1 yard line.
neil: Maybe you can trick him into pulling a Ryan Fitzpatrick and kneeling down in his own end zone.
joshua.hermsmeyer: LOL
Salfino: Rodgers was already on the slab, IMO. Toe tag in place for Week 9. He will rise again, I guess, but the Packers are not a good team.
sara.ziegler: You know who else in the NFC North isn’t a good team?
Trick question.
NO ONE in the NFC North is a good team.
Salfino: The Vikings are good, Sara. Sorry to get your hopes up. They just ran into Matt Moore!
Seriously, the Adam Thielen injury was crippling. Without him, they are pretty easy for even the Chiefs to defend.
sara.ziegler: I’m sorry.
You can’t say “They just ran into Matt Moore” about a good team.
Them’s the rules.
neil: “They just ran into Matt Moore” 🤣
Salfino: Moore is showing that playing QB in KC is very good for your stats. Also, seriously, the Vikings lost on a fluke 91-yard TD run by a guy who usually takes 45 runs to string together 90 yards.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I mean, if the QB drives the bus in terms of what makes a good team, then Sara is right. By total QBR, the Packers are 12th and the Vikings are 14th.
sara.ziegler: (BRB, pinning “Sara is right” to this conversation.)
I always think Kirk Cousins will do something amazing at the end of a game, and he never, ever, ever does.

— Evan Kaplan (@EpKap) November 3, 2019

Salfino: I agree on Cousins at the end of games. He’s like Matt Ryan in that regard: He can be relied on to not get it done. I know Ryan has a lot of fourth-quarter comebacks, but we need the batting average, not just the hits. And it turns out he’s lost 81 games by a TD or less in the period.
neil: Sheesh, you lose ONE Super Bowl after leading 28-3 …
sara.ziegler: Hahaha
Salfino: As for the other NFC North QBRs, the Lions — and Matthew Stafford — are sixth. We won’t talk about Mitch Trubisky.
neil: Sara probably has a lot to say about ol’ Mitchie!
But can we print it?
sara.ziegler: Trubisky, ugh. Can’t believe I had to start him in my fantasy football matchup against Neil. Let this be a lesson not to let jokes interfere with good fantasy football decisions.
Salfino: Just burn money in the street if you’re starting Trubisky in fantasy, Sara.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Or Allen Robinson, it turns out.
Salfino: Well, I believe in a QB-centric WR-ranking system. (And air yards :))
joshua.hermsmeyer: My man.
neil: And I started Cousins! (Because we traded them for each other.)
He may have lost the game, but he had a pretty good fantasy performance. Which, as you know, is all that matters.
sara.ziegler: Neil
joshua.hermsmeyer: oh noes
sara.ziegler: Shut up
neil: Lol.
Salfino: Sara gets the Price Is Wrong sounder.

sara.ziegler: Hahahaha
ANYWAY
One more game we must discuss, and that’s the incredible, amazing, UNBELIEVABLE first win of the season for the Miami Dolphins.
Mike … can you speak for Jets Nation and express your feelings at this one?
joshua.hermsmeyer: Yes, please.
I have a feeling this will be a treatise
sara.ziegler: “Salfino is typing”
Salfino: The most alarming thing for the Jets right now is Sam Darnold. But this is the product of so many losing drafts. The Jets have not had a hit in the first round of the draft, never mind the other rounds, since Darrelle Revis in 2007. And we’re talking a lot of draft capital. Another top-10 overall pick has just walked out the door in Leonard Williams.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Sixth overall selection for a third- and fifth-round pick. Yikes.
Salfino: The sad thing is that was a good trade for the Jets.
I mean, the Giants were insane to offer it. Now we have the Jets vs. Giants on Sunday in East Rutherford, which should temporarily be declared a toxic dump.
neil: Is it time to wonder whether Darnold is going to be any good? He had his moments but was mostly bad as a rookie and has been much worse this year. Maybe it’s still too early, but we’re 18 starts in and only five have been above average, according to our QB Elo.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I thought the game was really really interesting. There was another pretty glaring example (or two?) of Miami perhaps attempting to tank in-game, and yet Adam Gase and the Jets foiled them at every turn. The announcers even commented on it!
Salfino: It’s reasonable to wonder if Darnold is going to be any good, for certain. But if football is environment, and I think much of it is, he’s got a lot to overcome. Plus, who knows how long mono really lasts.
sara.ziegler: It’s really too bad when you can’t do the thing you’re trying to do … especially when that thing appears to be “losing.”
joshua.hermsmeyer: So frustrating!
neil: Well, idk why Miami continues to insist on starting Fitzy. They have a tank-ready QB right there in Josh Rosen.
sara.ziegler: Really not following the Tanking Playbook.
neil: TankBook?

neil: Either way, Fitzy has turned in above-average Elo games in two of his past three starts since being reinstated as starter. Rosen never came within 150 Elo points of being average in any of his starts.
And you know that Fitzpatrick runs hot and cold — so he has upside potential that really hurts your tankability when he plays well.
sara.ziegler: Need a new QB rating that ranks them by tankability. Just as a helpful service for tanking teams.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I’d like to go on the record that having a team or two tanking each season adds a bunch of entertainment value. Situations like this with the unexpected win, the team drama — all of it is good for the game IMO.
neil: Josh coming in with the pro-tanking take!
sara.ziegler: “Tanking = Good” was not the take I was expecting today.
joshua.hermsmeyer: The haughty anti-tankers reek of the folks that offer takes about amateurism in college football.
This is my fire for the week.
Salfino: I don’t think tanking can be leveraged in football because we don’t know if the QBs are going to be good or even what order to take them in.

One indication of how well Democrats are doing, aside from the polls, is how their fundraising numbers are faring in some of the most hotly contested Senate races.
Money isn’t everything in electoral politics, but it can help make an underdog more competitive and an incumbent less vulnerable. And on the face of it, Democrats have continued to maintain their edge in the money race. In the 14 races deemed competitive1 by election forecasters at Inside Elections, Sabato’s Crystal Ball and The Cook Political Report for which we have FEC filings,2 Democrats outraised Republicans by $65.5 million to $51.4 million in total contributions through the third quarter of 2019.3

On the face of it, this isn’t a great sign for Republicans. They are defending nine of these 14 seats and have eight incumbents running, so they should be in a better position to raise money than Democrats. But if we dig deeper, a race-by-race analysis shows these numbers are really a mixed bag for both parties.
For instance, a race where Republicans are considerably underwater is Kentucky, where Democrats have outraised Republicans by $4.6 million. Democrat Amy McGrath raised a remarkable $10.7 million in the third quarter. But even if McGrath continues to raise significantly more than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, it’s going to be very difficult to defeat him in strongly Republican Kentucky, especially with President Trump at the top of the ticket. Remember, too, McGrath raised a considerable amount of money in her 2018 House bid, but she still lost to the Republican incumbent by 3 points.
Unfortunately for Democrats, though, contributors don’t necessarily put their money toward races where Democrats have the strongest chances of picking up a seat. Case in point: in North Carolina, a state Trump carried by less than 4 points in 2016, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis and other GOP candidates have outraised Democratic candidates nearly three-to-one so far. (And Tillis raised $3.6 of the GOP’s $4.4 million, but he could have to spend a chunk of that in a potentially difficult primary against businessman Garland Tucker, who is doing a lot of self-funding.)
The races in Georgia, Iowa, Michigan and Texas also offered some positive financial indicators for the GOP. Republican Sens. David Perdue of Georgia, Joni Ernst of Iowa and John Cornyn of Texas led their Democratic opponents by between $700,000 and $1.6 million. And while Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan had more in total contributions — a nearly $2-million advantage in one of the GOP’s better takeover opportunities — John James, the likely Republican nominee, actually outraised Peters in the third quarter, $3.1 million to $2.4 million.
Yet Democrats had good news, too, most notably in Arizona, which is shaping up to be a key battleground state in 2020. Retired astronaut Mark Kelly brought in $13.8 million, compared with appointed Republican Sen. Martha McSally’s $7.9 million. And unlike Kelly, McSally could have some primary trouble that forces her to spend money against her fellow Republicans and not just Kelly. And down South, Alabama Sen. Doug Jones, the most endangered Democratic incumbent, outraised his Republican counterparts by about $2 million. He will probably have to keep that up in order to have much of a chance in a state Trump won by about 28 points.
It’s tough to outraise incumbents, but Democrats also managed to stay close in both Colorado and Maine — the only states Republicans are defending that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who abandoned his presidential bid to run for Senate in August, attracted slightly more contributions in the third quarter than Republican Sen. Cory Gardner — $2.1 million to 1.9 million, for instance. (Although Gardner still had more in total contributions.) In the second quarter, Gardner had actually been substantially outraised by the Democratic field, but with Hickenlooper’s entrance into the race, some leading Democrats dropped out, reducing Democrats’ total contributions. Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine brought in $700,000 more than the Democratic field, but Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon — the Democrats’ leading candidate — still managed to outraise Collins by $1.1 million in the third quarter. Still, one plus for Collins and Gardner is that they don’t have any primary opposition at the moment, unlike the Democrats in their states who will face crowded primaries.
There are also some lopsided numbers in a few other contests that are harder to make sense of. Democrats in Minnesota, New Hampshire and New Mexico have brought in far more than their Republican counterparts, which could make it tougher for the GOP to compete in those states. Meanwhile, Republicans hold a big lead in Kansas, but Republican-turned-Democrat Barbara Bollier jumped into the race in October, so the dynamics there could change, especially as Barry Grissom who had led in fundraising, with nearly $470,000 in the third quarter, dropped out and endorsed her.
In total, Democrats have continued their streak of outraising the GOP in these crucial contests, but each race tells its own story, and remember, a lot of money in the coffers doesn’t necessarily amount to victory. We’ve still got a long way to go between now and Election Day 2020.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

86 times the federal guidelines for lead
A yearlong collaborative investigation conducted by more than 120 journalists from nine universities and 10 media organizations found that thousands of test results for measuring lead exposure exceeded Canadian national guidelines. The investigation found results in several communities similar to levels in U.S. cities like Flint, Michigan, and Newark, New Jersey. The highest results were in tests from Edmonton, Alberta, where a 2017 test found 428 parts per billion in 2017 — 86 times the Canadian federal guideline. [The Toronto Star]
1st female Hearthstone champ
On Saturday night, Xiaomeng “VKLiooon” Li became the first woman to win the Hearthstone Grandmasters Global Finals, a major esports tournament with a top prize of $200,000. Hearthstone is a highly popular online card game from Activision Blizzard, the company best known for titles like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Guitar Hero. Li encouraged girls aspiring to compete in esports, saying, “As long as you want to play well, you can, no matter what gender you have.” [The Washington Post]
$37 million in stock options
Stephen Easterbrook may have lost his job as the CEO of McDonald’s after having a relationship with an employee, but he’s leaving with a huge golden parachute. In addition to $675,000 in severance pay and 18 months of health insurance benefits, Easterbrook was awarded stock options worth as much as $37 million, plus he’s still eligible for a pro-rated bonus for the work he did this year. The 52-year-old was voted out by the McDonald’s board on Friday following an investigation into the consensual relationship, which violated company policies. [Bloomberg]
$2.5 billion for affordable housing
On Monday, Apple announced it will direct $2.5 billion toward affordable housing initiatives in California, including helping first-time homebuyers with financing and down payments. The Cupertino technology company joins Facebook, Google and Microsoft in pledging to help address the significant increases in rent and real estate prices caused in part by the technology industry’s rapid expansion. According to the real estate company Zillow, in the last seven years, the median home price in California has risen by nearly 75 percent to $550,800, and the average rent has gone up 40 percent to $2,293. [Los Angeles Times]
462 prisoners released
The state of Oklahoma released 462 prisoners on Monday after Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt commuted the sentences of 527 people who had been convicted of nonviolent offenses. The move is part of a wider effort to reform the criminal justice system in Oklahoma, which has the highest incarceration rate in the country. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board estimated that the cost of having the inmates serve out their full sentences would have cost the state $11.9 million. [Vox]
180 intellectual property theft cases
Seventy-one institutions across the country are investigating 180 separate cases of potential intellectual property theft, mostly involving biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health, after receiving information from the FBI and other sources, sent letters asking institutions to investigate certain scientists. The New York Times reports almost all the incidents involved scientists of Chinese descent, including naturalized American citizens, and allegations they are stealing “scientific ideas, designs, devices, data and methods that may lead to profitable new treatments or diagnostic tools” for China. Critics say Chinese and Chinese American scientists are being unfairly targeted as the U.S. competition with China intensifies. [The New York Times]

Their performance was very strong in the 2018 midterms, despite the challenge of having to poll dozens of diverse congressional districts around the country, many of which had not had a competitive election in years. Polls have also generally been accurate in the various special elections and off-year gubernatorial elections that have occurred since 2016, even though those are also often difficult races to poll.
[Related: FiveThirtyEight’s Pollster Ratings]
Does that mean everything is looking up in the industry? Well, no. We’ll introduce some complications in a moment. But I do want to re-emphasize that opening takeaway, since the media is just flatly wrong when it asserts that the polls can’t be trusted. In fact, American election polls are about as accurate as they’ve always been. That doesn’t mean polls will always identify the right winner, especially in close elections. (As a simple rule of thumb, we’ve found polls “call” the right winner 80 percent of the time, meaning they fail to do so the other 20 percent of the time — although upsets are more likely to occur in some circumstances than others.) But the rate of upsets hasn’t changed much over time.
Before we go any further, I want to direct you to the latest version of FiveThirtyEight’s pollster ratings, which we’ve updated for the first time since May 2018. They include all polls in the three weeks leading up to every U.S. House, U.S. Senate and gubernatorial general election since then,1 including special elections, plus a handful of polls from past years that were missing from previous versions of our database. You can find much more detail on the pollster ratings here, including all the polls used in the ratings calculation. Our presidential approval ratings, generic congressional ballot and impeachment trackers have also been updated to reflect these new ratings, although they make little difference to the topline numbers.
Now then, for those complications: The main one is simply that response rates to traditional telephone polls continue to decline. In large part because of caller-ID and call-blocking technologies, it’s simply harder than it used to be to get people to answer phone calls from people they don’t know. In addition to potentially making polls less accurate, that also makes them more expensive, since a pollster has to spend more time making calls for every completed response that it gets. As a result, the overall number of polls has begun to slightly decline. There were 532 polls in our pollster ratings database, which covers polls in the 21 days before elections occur, associated with elections on Nov. 6, 2018, which is down from 558 polls for Election Day 2014 and 692 polls for Election Day 2010.2

So why not turn to online polls or other new technologies? Well, the problem is that in recent elections, polls that use live interviewers to call both landlines and cellphones continue to outperform other methods, such as online and automated (IVR) polls. Moreover, online and IVR polls are generally more prone toward herding — that is, making methodological choices, or picking and choosing which results they publish, in ways that make their polls match other, more traditional polls. So not only are online and automated polls somewhat less accurate than live-caller polls, but they’d probably suffer a further decline in accuracy if they didn’t have live polls to herd toward.
Still, online polling is undoubtedly a large part of polling’s future — and some online polling firms are more accurate than others. Among the most prolific online pollsters, for example, YouGov stands out for being more accurate than others such as Zogby, SurveyMonkey, and Harris Insights & Analytics. And many former IVR pollsters are now migrating to hybrid methods that combine automated phone polling with internet panels. In the 2018 elections, this produced better results in some cases (e.g., SurveyUSA) than in others (e.g., Rasmussen Reports).
Polls have been quite accurate — and unbiased — in post-2016 elections
Each time we update our pollster ratings, we publish a few charts that depict the overall health of the industry — so let’s go ahead and run the numbers again. The first chart is the one we consider to be the most important: the average error of polls broken down by the type of election. A few quick methodological notes:
By average error, I mean the difference between the margin projected by the poll and the actual election result. For instance, if the poll shows the Democrat up by 1 percentage point and the Republican wins by 2 points, that would be a 3-point error.
To not give any one polling firm too much influence, the values in the chart are weighted based on the number of polls a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle3
Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect that they faked data are excluded from the analysis.
Note that I’ve included the handful of elections that have occurred so far in 2019 with the 2017-18 election cycle, even though we’ll classify them them later as part of the 2019-20 cycle instead.
OK, here’s the data:

Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.
As I said, the 2017-19 cycle was one of the most accurate on record for polling. The average error of 5.0 points in polls of U.S. House elections is the second-best in our database, trailing only 1999-2000. The 4.3-point error associated with U.S. Senate elections is also the second-best, slightly trailing 2005-06. And gubernatorial polls had an average error of 5.3 points, which is about average by historical standards.
Combining all different types of elections together, we find that polls from 2017 onward have been associated with an average error of 5.0 points, which is considerably better than the 6.7-point average for 2015-16, and the best in any election cycle since 2003-04.
But note that there’s just not much of an overall trajectory — upward or downward — in polling accuracy. Relatively strong cycles for the polls can be followed by relatively weak ones, and vice versa.
One more key reminder now that the Iowa caucuses are only three months away: Some types of elections are associated with considerably larger polling errors than others. In particular, presidential primaries feature polling that is often volatile at best, and downright inaccurate at worst. Overall, presidential primary polls in our database mispredict the final margin between the top two candidates by an average of 8.7 points. And the error was even worse, 10.1 points, in the 2016 primary cycle. Leads of 10 points, 15 points or sometimes more are not necessarily safe in the primaries.
We can also look at polling accuracy by simply counting up how often the candidate leading in the poll wins his or her race.4 This isn’t our preferred method, as it’s a bit simplistic — if a poll had the Republican ahead by 1 point and the Democrat won by 1 point, that’s a much more accurate result than if the Republican had won by 20, even though it would have incorrectly identified the winner. But across all polls in our database, the winner was “called” 79 percent of the time.

Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.
In recent elections, the winning percentage has been slightly below the long-term average — it was 76 percent in 2017-19. But this reflects the recent uptick in close elections, and that resource-constrained pollsters tend to poll these close elections more heavily.5
As basic as this analysis is, it’s essential to remember that polls are much more likely to misidentify the winner when they show a close race. Polls in our database that showed a lead of 3 percentage points or less identified the winner only 58 percent of the time — a bit better than random chance, but not much better. But polls showing a 3- or 6-point lead were right 72 percent of the time, and those with a 6- or 10-point lead were right 86 percent of the time. (Errors in races showing double-digit leads are quite rare in general elections, although they occur with some frequency in primaries. And errors in races where one candidate leads by 20 or more points are once-in-a-blue-moon types of events, regardless of the type of election.)

Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.
Another essential measure of polling accuracy is statistical bias — that is, whether the polls tend to miss in the same direction. We’re particularly interested in understanding whether polls systematically favor Democrats or Republicans. Take the polls in 2016, for instance. Although they weren’t that bad from an accuracy standpoint, the majority underestimated President Trump and Republicans running for Congress and governor, leading them to underestimate how well Trump would do in the Electoral College. Overall in the 2015-16 cycle, polls had a Democratic bias (meaning they overestimated Democrats and underestimated Republicans) of 3.0 percentage points. And that after a 2013-14 cycle when polls also had a Democratic bias (of 2.7 percentage points).

Bias is calculated only for elections where the top two finishers were a Republican and Democrat. Therefore, it is not calculated for presidential primaries. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.
In 2017-19, however, polls had essentially no partisan bias, and to the extent there was one, it was a very slight bias toward Republicans (0.3 percentage points). And that’s been the long-term pattern: Whatever bias there is in one batch of election polls doesn’t tend to persist from one cycle to the next. The Republican bias in the polls in 2011-12, for instance, which tended to underestimate then-President Obama’s re-election margins, was followed by two cycles of Democratic bias in 2013-14 and 2015-16, as previously mentioned. There is simply not much point in trying to guess the direction of poll bias ahead of time; if anything, it often seems to go against what the conventional wisdom expects. Instead, you should always be prepared for the possibility of systematic polling errors of several percentage points in either direction.
Which pollsters have been most accurate in recent elections?
Although it can be dangerous to put too much stock in the performance of a pollster in a single election cycle — it takes dozens of polls to reliably assess a pollster’s accuracy — it’s nonetheless worth briefly remarking on the recent performance of some of the more prolific ones. Below, you’ll find the average error, statistical bias and a calculation we call Advanced Plus-Minus (basically, how the pollster’s average error compares to other pollsters’ in the same election),6 for pollsters with at least five polls in our database for the 2017-19 cycle. Note that negative Advanced Plus-Minus scores are good; they indicate that a firm’s polls were more accurate than others in the same races.

Four of the top 5 and 6 of the 10 best pollsters according to this metric were exclusively live-caller telephone polls. In exciting news for fans of innovative polling, the list includes polls from our friends at The New York Times’s Upshot, who launched an extremely successful and accurate polling collaboration with Siena College in 2016. (It also includes ABC News, FiveThirtyEight’s corporate parent, which usually conducts its polls jointly with The Washington Post.)
Conversely, the five of the top six worst-performing pollsters — including firms such as Carroll Strategies, Dixie Strategies, and Rasmussen Reports/Pulse Opinion Research — were IVR pollsters (sometimes in conjunction with other methods), several of which had strong Republican leans in 2017-19. Some IVR pollsters did perform reasonably well in 2015-16, a cycle where most pollsters underestimated Republicans. In retrospect, though, that may have been a case of two wrongs making a right; IVR polls tend to be Republican-leaning, so they’ll look good in years where Republicans beat their polls, but they’ll often be among the worst polls otherwise.
Indeed, aggregating the pollsters by methodology confirms that live caller polls continue to be the most accurate. Below are the aggregate scores for the three major categories of polls — live caller, online, and IVR — by our Advanced Plus-Minus metric, average error and statistical bias.7

Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.
The differences are clearest when looking at pollsters that exclusively used one method. Polls that exclusively used live callers (including calling cellphones) had an average error of 4.4 percentage points in the 2017-19 cycle, as compared to 5.0 points for polls exclusively conducted online or via text message, and 6.9 points for polls that exclusively used IVR. (Pure IVR polls, however, are now quite rare. Polls that used a hybrid of IVR and other methods did better, with an average error of 5.0 percentage points.)
Polling firms that are members of professional polling organizations that push for transparency and other best practices also continue to outperform those that aren’t. In particular, our pollster ratings give credit to firms that support the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Transparency Initiative, belong to the National Council on Public Polls (NCPP), or contribute data to the Roper Center archive. Pollsters that are part of one or more of these initiatives had an average error of 4.3 percentage points in the 2017-19 cycle, as compared to 5.4 percentage points for those that aren’t.
Another way to detect herding
Our pollster ratings have also long included an adjustment to account for the fact that online and automated polls tend to perform better when there are high-quality polls in the field. We’ve confirmed that this still applies. For instance, polls that are conducted online or via IVR8 are about 0.4 percentage points more accurate based on our Advanced Plus-Minus metric when their polls are preceded by “gold standard” polls in the same race. (“Gold standard” is the term we use for pollsters that are exclusively live caller with cellphones and are also AAPOR/NCPP/Roper members.) Live-caller polls do not exhibit the same pattern, however; their Advanced Plus-Minus score is unaffected by the existence of an earlier “gold standard” poll in the field. This is probably the result of herding; some of the lower-quality pollsters may be doing the equivalent of peeking at their more studious classmate’s answers in a math test. In fact, these differences are especially strong in recent elections, suggesting that herding has become more of a problem.
There is also a second, more direct method to detect herding, which we’re also now applying in our pollster ratings. Namely — as described in this story — there is a minimum distance that a poll should be from the average of previous polls based on sampling error alone. For instance, even if you knew that a candidate was ahead 48-41 in a particular race — a 7-point lead — you’d miss that margin by an average of about 5 percentage points in a 600-person poll because sampling only 600 people rather than the entire population introduces sampling error. That is, because of sampling error, some polls would inevitably show a 12-point lead and some would show a 2-point lead instead of all the polls being bunched together at a 6- or 7- or 8-point lead exactly. If the polls are very tightly bunched together, this is not a good thing — you should be suspicious of herding, which can sometimes yield embarrassing outcomes where every poll gets the answer wrong
Of course, there are other complications in the real world. There’s no guarantee that the race will have been static since other pollsters surveyed the race; one candidate may be losing or gaining ground. And pollsters have healthy methodological disagreements from one another, so the same race may look different depending on what assumptions they make about turnout and so forth. But these should tend to increase the degree to which polls differ from each other, and not produce herding.
But our herding penalty only applies if pollsters show too little variation from the average of previous polls of the race9 based on sampling error10 alone. If a pollster is publishing all its data without being influenced by other pollsters — including its supposed outliers — it should be fairly easy to avoid this penalty over the long run.
Many polls are closer to the average of previous polls than they “should” be, however. Unlike the previous type of herding I described, which is concentrated among lower-quality pollsters who are essentially trying to draft off their neighbors to get better results, this tendency appears among some higher-quality pollsters as well. In some cases, we suspect, this is because, late in the race, a pollster doesn’t want to deal with the media firestorm that would inevitably ensue if it published a poll that appears to be an outlier. In other cases, frankly, we suspect that pollsters rather explicitly look at the FiveThirtyEight or RealClearPolitics polling average and attempt to match it.
In any event, our formula now detects this type of herding, and it results in a lower pollster rating when we catch it.11. Our pollster ratings spreadsheet now calculates each pollster’s Average Distance from Polling Average, or ADPA, which is how much the pollster’s average poll differs from the average of previous polls of that race.12 Among pollsters with at least 15 polls,13 the largest herding penalties are as follows:

Other methodological changes
Unless you’re really into details — or you’re a pollster! — you probably aren’t going to care about these … but there are a few other methodological changes we’ve made to our pollster ratings this year.
Previously, pollsters got a bonus if they exclusively conducted their polls via live callers with cellphones, since these have been the most accurate polls over time. But this year, if a pollster uses live-caller-with-cellphone polls in combination with other methodologies, we now give them partial credit for the live-caller bonus. Even though these hybrid polls did not have a particularly good performance in 2017-19, they’ve been reasonably strong in the long run; also, we’re bowing to the reality that many formerly live pollsters are increasingly incorporating online or other methods into their repertoire.
In determining whether a poll’s result fell into or outside the margin of error, a calculation that’s available in our spreadsheet, we now use a more sophisticated margin of error formula that accounts for the percentages of the top two candidates and not just the distance between them. The margin of error is smaller in lopsided races, e.g., when one candidate leads 70-20.
Our Predictive Plus-Minus scores and pollster letter grades are based on a combination of a pollster’s empirical performance (how accurate it has been in the past) and its methodological characteristics. The more polls a firm has conducted, the more the formula weights its performance rather than its methodological prior. In assigning the weights, our formula now considers how recent a particular firm’s polls were. In other words, if a pollster has conducted a lot of surveys recently, its empirical accuracy will be more heavily weighted. But if most of its polling is in the distant past, its pollster rating will gradually revert toward the mean based on its methodology.
For pollsters with a relatively small sample of polling, we now show a provisional rating rather than a precise letter grade. (An “A/B” provisional rating means that the pollster has shown strong initial results, a “B/C” rating means it has average initial results, and a “C/D” rating means below-average initial results.) It now takes roughly 20 recent polls (or a larger number of older polls) for a pollster to get a precise pollster rating.
That’s all for now! Once again, you can find an interactive version of the pollster ratings here, and a link with further detail on them here. And if you have questions about the pollster ratings, you can always reach us here. Good luck to pollsters on having a strong performance in the primaries.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/draymond-green-is-a-star-but-only-in-the-right-system/,2019-11-05,,,features,"Nov. 5, 2019","Draymond Green Is A Star, But Only In The Right System",Chris Herring,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"Coming into this season, it would have been hard to imagine a harder, faster fall from grace for the Golden State Warriors. Even after a surprising win Monday night over Portland, they have managed just two victories a couple weeks into the season, all while owning the worst defense, by far, in the league to this point.
That’s been the harsh reality for Golden State ever since Stephen Curry broke his left hand last week. The club responded by saying it will be at least three months until Curry is back in uniform, a timeline that all but dunked the Warriors’ playoff hopes in icy water.
We knew all along that this season could be somewhat challenging for Golden State, which lost Klay Thompson to a long-term injury and Kevin Durant to the Brooklyn Nets. Add in Curry’s injury and everything looks extra dire. But even when taking all that into account, the Warriors still have two other All-Stars on the roster who could, in theory, at least keep the team competitive, if not in the race for the postseason: Newcomer D’Angelo Russell and three-time All-Star Draymond Green. At least so far, that doesn’t seem to be happening.
Which perhaps raises some questions about Green, in particular. He may be the most fascinating, hard-to-judge player in the sport — especially right now. A number of things make Green quite challenging to evaluate from a value standpoint. But there’s a strong case to be made that the 29-year-old’s integral fit within the Warriors’ highly unusual ecosystem is perhaps the biggest factor in his enigmatic, one-of-a-kind game. With that ecosystem in tatters at the moment, is Green’s value disproportionately diminished?
After a couple of All-NBA honors, a Defensive Player of the Year award and five straight trips to the NBA Finals, we’ve all heard Draymond discussed as an elite NBA player. Advanced metrics all but confirm that: Over the past six seasons,1 Green ranked 13th and 14th, respectively, among NBA players in RAPTOR — FiveThirtyEight’s new player-rating metric — and Wins Above Replacement.
For a league with just 30 teams, a player ranking in the low teens in value should theoretically not only make him a franchise player, but arguably have him in the conversation to be a superstar, if he isn’t already at that level. Yet in most peoples’ eyes, Green almost certainly falls short of both definitions, something that only figures to become more clear as this season pushes ahead, and the losses presumably pile up without Curry or Thompson in the lineup2 to stop the bleeding.
It’s well established that Green — a below-average 3-point shooter for his career, who has never averaged more than 14 points per game in a season — is not a big-time scorer. And likely no one expected him to become one this year. Instead, he’s won praise in the past for the other, more well-rounded elements of his game: His versatility and know-how as a top-flight defender; his rugged, sometimes agitating style of play; and his next-level vision as a passer. Surely that has influenced the extent to which Green is seen as a “super star” — his value comes in the less heralded parts of the game.
On some level, though, we’re also seeing the limits of just how useful Green’s skills are in a vacuum — without the ability to score in bunches — and on a team that doesn’t have other solid vets. (Of course it’s very early, with Green having played just five games and 144 minutes thus far. But in those limited minutes, Green has provided negative 0.3 wins above replacement, according to RAPTOR. That ranks just 388th in the league out of 410 players.)
With Green, a major part of the issue seems to be the fine print: That, yes, he is indeed one of the best players in the league, but that we’ve seen enough to know that his game is exponentially enhanced depending on who else is playing alongside him. (Another player some people made this argument about: Rockets’ lob specialist Clint Capela, who had a lengthy stalemate in free agency with the club before both sides seemed to realize just how much they maximized each other, and exactly how they would be weakened if they had parted ways.)
Yes, for instance, Green is a great passer, and has led the Warriors in assists per game each of the last four seasons. But while his vision is a clear plus, there’s also no denying that he’s likely been the biggest offensive beneficiary of Curry’s gravity over the years. For years, Green and Curry’s high screens gave Golden State countless 4-on-3 advantages when defenses chose to send two players at Steph to deny him a look at the basket. That left Draymond with a downhill opportunity, much like a halfback with holes to run through because of all the space his O-line left him. There were countless tic-tac-toe plays, where Curry would dump a simple pass to Green following a pick, where Green would dribble once before tossing an alley-oop to a teammate who’d darted toward the basket, where no defender was in place.
https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/TICTACTOE2-1.mp4
As such, many of Green’s assists stemmed from space and passes that Curry initiated. In fact, over those same four seasons, Curry actually led the NBA in hockey assists per game,3 according to Second Spectrum and NBA Advanced Stats. Both his shooting, and the team’s pace — which was generally far faster with Curry on the court than without him4 — gave Green cleaner passing scenarios than other players around the league.
Green deserves credit for being one of the most physical screeners in basketball, something you can’t necessarily diminish simply because the Warriors are shorthanded at the moment. Yet those screens — a fundamental bedrock of Golden State’s beautifully chaotic attack on offense — don’t carry the same weight when they’re freeing up looks for Jordan Poole and Glenn Robinson III as opposed to Durant and Thompson. And despite Green’s picks being solid, the Warriors’ offense under Steve Kerr generally utilized far fewer ball screens than other clubs, instead opting for screens away from the ball, which often confused defenses.
One might think that Draymond’s stalwart defense wouldn’t necessarily change all that much with the new cast of players, but in a way, that element of his game might actually be affected the most by the plethora of young players in Golden State’s lineup. Consider for a moment who the Warriors could roll out defensively on a given night in previous seasons: Durant. Thompson. Former Finals MVP Andre Iguodala. Shaun Livingston.
The sheer amount of defensive length in those lineups made it difficult for opponents to pass the ball, let alone shoot it. Because of that, Golden State led the NBA in blocked shots the last three seasons — in 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 — while finishing second in the league the two years before that. But so far, the Warriors rank dead-last in blocked shots per game. (And in five games, Draymond himself has none.) To open the campaign, we’ve seen a situation where Green can’t realistically cover at the rim for his young teammates, who are still learning the tricks and nuances of the trade.
There’s also one thing that statistics probably can’t enlighten us on just yet: Morale. We’ve all heard about the competitive fire that’s within Draymond Green, a player who earned his first technical foul in the pros after taunting and celebrating his first NBA bucket. No one else in the league is wired quite like him, which can be both a good, and sometimes bad, explosive sort of thing. He’s never been part of a losing team, so it’s unclear how this season might impact his psyche, particularly if he’s the Warriors’ only original star out there playing most nights.

For his part, coach Steve Kerr has already signaled that he’ll be somewhat conservative with how he uses Green, likely to salvage the forward’s body and spirit, in what may ultimately be a throwaway year for the Warriors. Both Kerr and the club have every reason to think that going into next season with a healthy Curry, Thompson, Russell5 and Green would put Golden State right back in the conversation for a title.
So on the one hand, it may seem strange to have such low expectations for these Warriors when they still have a top-15 player like Green on the roster. And yes: That may speak to the fact that he isn’t a superstar. But given what he excels at, it probably makes more sense to judge his value again once we see him in the environment we know he can thrive within. And in that way, he’s really no different than any elite NBA player: If Green looks worse on his own than another “star” would, who cares? Both still need other pieces and the right system to truly succeed.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/minnesota-is-finally-a-program-to-reckon-with/,2019-11-05,,,features,"Nov. 5, 2019",Minnesota Is Finally A Program To Reckon With,Josh Planos,FiveThirtyEight,College Football,"The storied history of the Minnesota Golden Gophers football program is perhaps best exhibited by its claim to the origins of cheerleading. With Minnesota in the midst of a three-game losing streak in 1898,1 an editorial ran in the school paper that said, in part, “Any plan that would stir up enthusiasm for athletics would be helpful.”
More than a century later, Head Coach P.J. Fleck’s methodology, which calls for an unconventional supply of energy, has whisked up plenty in the Twin Cities, having transformed a contemporary doormat into the most surprising unbeaten team remaining.2 After Minnesota’s most recent win, Fleck all but begged ESPN’s “College GameDay” to visit Minneapolis for the upcoming matchup with Penn State.3
But prime-time consideration or not, one thing is certain: Fleck has his players rowing — and rowing, and rowing, and rowing — toward the spotlight. Though the Gophers aren’t national title contenders yet, according to Vegas oddsmakers and most efficiency metrics, it’s nearly impossible to argue they aren’t at least contender-adjacent.
Minnesota is 8-0 for the first time since 19414 and has won 12 of its last 14 games. It’s instructive to recall that as recently as 2007, this was the worst Power Five team in the country by some metrics. Fan support isn’t exactly robust, either: Despite opening TCF Bank Stadium in 2009, the team has drawn such minimal attendance that the university’s official website can only boast that it has “the largest home locker room in college or professional football,” noting that someone could run a 60-yard dash inside it.5 All of which, of course, only adds to the strange reclamation project that has taken place in Fleck’s third season at the helm. Suddenly a program that went a combined 12-13 in Fleck’s first two seasons is on its way to a potential berth in the Big Ten championship game.
Like many seasoned programs, the Gophers have filled a trophy case over the decades, but college football’s Energizer Bunny might soon be unlocking it for the first time in the modern era.
Fleck’s is a mostly balanced operation. Minnesota’s offense and defense each ranks in the top 20 in expected points added,6 while the special-teams unit is abominable, ranking 124th out of 130 teams. “I think the teams that can be balanced at any moment, and can control and sustain the balance, are going to be the most dangerous teams,” Fleck has noted this season.
With top-tier quarterback Tanner Morgan and the school’s all-time leader in all-purpose yardage, Rodney Smith, in the backfield, the Gophers drink heavily from the value spigot that is play-action, generating the 25th most expected points added of any team via the play type. Minnesota piles up 9.67 net yards per pass attempt,7 which leads the Big Ten. The Gophers convert third downs at the eighth-highest clip, maintain drives and roast defenses upon reaching the red zone. On defense, the Gophers are on the hunt, specifically in the passing game. Only 10 teams have garnered more expected points added on pass defense — and only eight teams have compiled more interceptions.
In conference play, the Gophers are boat-racing the opposition. Only Clemson and Alabama have outscored conference opponents by a wider margin, and no team has held the lead longer in conference play than the Gophers, who have led for 28 minutes and 49 seconds through five games. They’ve outscored the last three opponents 128-24.
Additionally, the way in which Fleck has built the program portends to future success. By diligently recruiting, Minnesota has inked the highest-ranked consecutive recruiting classes in school history, according to Fleck. Just as he proved at Western Michigan, Fleck can attract marquee talent.
This analysis would prove hollow if strength of schedule weren’t noted. Unblemished record aside, Minnesota touts a body of work generously described as tepid. Minnesota won its first three games by a total of 13 points, needing a touchdown with less than 30 seconds remaining to beat Georgia Southern at home. The team’s best win is probably a double-overtime nail-biter over Fresno State, a program that ranks outside the top 60 in total efficiency. Opponents have a combined win percentage of .481, which ranks 98th nationally. But there will be no shortage of tests over the upcoming month: The Gophers play three ranked opponents over the next four weeks, two of which rank in the top 10 on ESPN’s Football Power Index. This week’s matchup against Penn State is considered by some to be the program’s biggest in a half-century.
With the subtlety of a flash grenade, Fleck has turned a fledgling football team into one closing in on its second 10-win campaign since the early 20th century. He brought an identity to a forgotten wasteland in a marquee conference. Regardless of how nauseating his sayings may seem to outsiders, Fleck brought oars to the Land of 10,000 Lakes and taught a community to embrace a shared mantra. “We’re as good as we are right now, that’s all I know,” Fleck said last month in certified coach-speak. What the Gophers are right now is pretty damn good — and that’s something they haven’t been in a while.

11,000 scientists warn of ‘untold suffering’
A statement from more than 11,000 scientists warns the global population will experience “untold suffering due to the climate crisis” unless major changes are made to how people live on a daily basis. The recommendations include “ending population growth, leaving fossil fuels in the ground, halting forest destruction and slashing meat eating” and the statement specifically connects the current climate crisis with excessive consumption from wealthy lifestyles.

$50,000 daily fine
On Tuesday, a U.S. district judge ruled that the state of Texas must pay a $50,000 fine for every day that foster children living in large group homes do not have 24-hour supervision. In 2011, there was a class-action lawsuit against alleging child abuse in long-term foster care facilities, and reforms are being implemented now. However, the judge was unsatisfied with how quickly changes are being made and said the fines could double to $100,000. [Houston Chronicle]
86 percent of young Americans
Do you remember what you did to make money when you were younger? Things are … different now. According to a survey from Morning Consult, 86 percent of people between the ages of 13 and 18 are willing to try out influencing, the practice of getting paid to promote products on platforms like Instagram and YouTube. And while 61 percent of the survey’s respondents already post online about brands, only 12 percent consider themselves actual influencers. [Bloomberg]
500 additional police offices
New York City’s subways are notorious for delays, poor maintenance, strange smells and weekend schedules filled with closures and confusing notices. The New York Times reports Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants to expand the number of police on patrol in the system by another 500 officers (there are 2,500 currently) to deal with fare evasion and homelessness. The additional policing would cost more than $50 million a year, which critics say is ridiculous given the subway system’s financial crisis. [New York Times]
100 percent dingo
It’s one thing to wonder exactly what breed your rescue pet is, it’s entirely another to find an adorable stray pup found in the backyard of an Australian rural town, and then discover it’s an endangered Australian alpine dingo. A DNA test confirmed the discovery, which excited conservationists because Australian alpine dingos are currently vulnerable to extinction. The very cute pup was named Wandi, after the town of Wandiligong where it was found. [Washington Post]
78 years
It has been 78 years since the Minnesota Golden Gophers football program started its season with a record of eight wins and no losses, but the team is now playing surprisingly well. The Gophers have a top-tier quarterback and and now generate 9.67 net yards per pass attempt. The team is up against fifth-ranked Penn State this Saturday. [FiveThirtyEight]

But could this unfortunate injury end up working in the Warriors’ favor? The Hot Takedown team breaks down the different strategies the Warriors might employ going forward, discusses whether tanking is ever advisable and examines how the strategy differs in the NBA from other major sports.
College basketball starts tonight, and we have new teams atop the preseason AP polls. On the women’s side, the No. 1 spot is occupied neither by historically dominant UConn nor defending champ Baylor, but by Oregon, led by Sabrina Ionescu. On the men’s side, Michigan State is the preseason No. 1 for the first time in school history. We discuss what to expect out of the Ducks and Spartans and what the preseason polls shows us about college basketball success.

The New York Times and The Washington Post recently reported that some influential Democrats are clamoring for new candidates to enter the 2020 presidential race. Sure, there are 17 “major” candidates1 already running, but Democratic bigwigs are apparently convinced that that isn’t enough, and want someone — Hillary Clinton, or Sherrod Brown, or John Kerry, or Michael Bloomberg — to come to the rescue.
Is this a real possibility?
I can’t read the minds of any of those bold-faced names, all of whom have reportedly been urged by Democratic donors to enter the race. But I think these donors are out to lunch — and out of touch: I don’t buy that Democratic voters really want another candidate. And even if the voters did, I don’t think the new candidate would find it so easy to succeed.
First, Democratic voters are extremely happy with the field as is. According to a July poll by the Pew Research Center, 65 percent of Democrats rate their field as “excellent” or “good.” That’s essentially tied with 2008 for the highest enthusiasm Pew has ever found among Democrats:

And the numbers may have only improved since then — a HuffPo/YouGov poll conducted last week found 83 percent of Democrats were satisfied with their choices.
Second, late-entering candidates don’t exactly have a stellar track record. Remember Fred Thompson in 2008? Or Wesley Clark in 2004? Or even Rick Perry in 2012? Well, maybe not. These candidates were supposed “white knights” who entered their races late — and completely flopped. It’s not easy running for president — setting up campaign offices, public relations teams, a fundraising apparatus, etc. all takes time — and it’s no coincidence that the leading candidates got into the race early.
There’s another reason that new 2020 contender talk is likely empty speculation: Democratic donors are supposedly concerned about the flaws of the current candidates, but the names they’re floating are … deeply flawed. Democratic voters don’t want a blast from the past like Hillary Clinton, for example; in polling of Iowa caucus-goers by the Des Moines Register from late last year, 72 percent of Democrats said Clinton would detract from the field. Brown is at least pretty popular, but polls of Bloomberg’s favorable ratings show middling results at best.
Moreover, Democratic voters prize electability. And Clinton and Kerry aren’t exactly the first people you’d associate with winning a general election. Conversely, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren all lead President Trump in general election polls. (No, you shouldn’t take these polls too seriously, but they’re worth considering in this context.)
In all, I’d be very surprised if Clinton, Kerry, Bloomberg or any other big-name Democrat became a major factor in this race, let alone won the nomination. It’s a little more feasible that donors dissatisfied with the front-runners will line up behind one of the candidates who is already running, such as Cory Booker or Amy Klobuchar.
In the end, though, I think this talk of Clinton or Bloomberg is a sign of two things: first, the media getting bored with the race and searching for a new storyline. And second, the establishment’s influence is declining as candidates like Warren and Sanders are succeeding without taking their money. Some big donors might simply want back in on the action.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-15-percent-threshold-for-primary-delegates-could-winnow-the-field/,2019-11-04,,,features,"Nov. 4, 2019",How The 15 Percent Threshold For Primary Delegates Could Winnow The Field,Josh Putnam,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"As we get ever closer to the Iowa caucuses, you’re probably going to hear a lot more about whether candidates are on track to meet the 15 percent threshold to qualify for pledged delegates. That threshold matters even in states like Iowa, where there are actually relatively few delegates at stake. And that’s because if a candidate doesn’t hit that threshold — either statewide or at the congressional district level1 — they will not win any national convention delegates, making a path to the nomination pretty much impossible.
So say we apply that 15 percent threshold to the current national polls. Within the crowded field, only former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are polling above that threshold. (Hypothetically, someone like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg could break into that group, especially given his standing in Iowa polls.) A group of four candidates consistently clustered around or above the 15 percent threshold could complicate the race for delegates. But is there any real history of that sort of logjam in Democratic presidential nomination politics?
The short answer is: No. The current 15 percent threshold has been in effect since the 1992 Democratic primary,2 and since then there has never been a primary or caucus in which four candidates have earned more than 15 percent of the vote state- or territory-wide. But there have been several instances in which three candidates have surpassed that threshold in a single contest, as you can see in the table below.

Primaries that included an incumbent president or less than three candidates were not included. Candidates who actively contested at least one primary outside their home state were considered competitive. All cycles include 56 primaries or caucuses (50 states plus the District of Columbia and five territories), except for 2016, which added the Northern Mariana Islands to bring the total contests up to 57.
Sources: CQ Weekly Report, the green papers, William G. Mayer’s “In Pursuit of the White House”
But even if you applied the 15 percent threshold to cycles before 1992, the picture does not change significantly. Earlier cycles featured contests where four or more candidates got more than 15 percent of the vote, but it was still the exception, not the norm. Between 1972 and 1988, there were only five individual contests where four candidates managed to earn more than 15 percent of the vote state- or territory-wide3 — less than 2 percent of all contests across those five cycles.
So while much has been made of this idea that the 15 percent threshold could make the primaries particularly messy — technically, as many as six candidates could earn 15 percent of the vote in a given contest, but that’s never happened statewide in the modern presidential primary era. Still, focusing on the results from previous Democratic contests can only take us so far. Yes, there have been past cycles with large candidate fields, but arguably none occurred under conditions comparable to today’s party rules and partisan environment. If we want a better comparison for how the 15 percent threshold might play out, we can turn to the 2016 Republican presidential nomination race — another historically large field.
Republicans don’t impose a 15 percent threshold for allocating delegates in their primary — instead, the Republican National Committee sets a ceiling of 20 percent, and states that proportionally allocate delegates have the latitude to set a lower qualifying threshold — but if they did, the overall outcome would resemble that of the Democrats. No primaries or caucuses had more than three candidates break 15 percent statewide.
But the number of contests where three candidates cleared the 15 percent threshold statewide did last for quite a while in the 2016 GOP primary. In total, 25 out of 57 contests4 saw three candidates — some combination of Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Donald Trump — clear the 15 percent threshold statewide. And while most of these contests happened during February and the first half of March, there were some primaries later in the year where this was the case, too. Take the Maryland Republican primary in late April. Cruz, Kasich and Trump all cleared the 15 percent threshold, meaning they would have each gotten some delegates.5
This has important implications for Democrats in 2020, though, because if Republicans followed Democrats’ delegate allocation rules, both Cruz and Kasich would have had opportunities to win (or win more) delegates at both the state and congressional district level. Remember, it’s not just statewide delegates at stake in the Democratic primary. Three-quarters of all delegates are awarded based on the results in each individual congressional district.
So let’s look at congressional districts in the 2016 GOP nomination race where three or more candidates cleared that 15 percent threshold. There were a greater number of examples — in total, 119 of 257 relevant congressional districts6 (or nearly half) saw three candidates break the 15 percent barrier — but it wasn’t like there was a sudden logjam with multiple candidates clearing this threshold.7 Only in one district did four Republicans receive more than 15 percent of the vote (the 3rd district in Kansas). And again, most of this happened in contests that occurred during the first half of March 2016. But there were a handful of districts where three candidates won 15 percent of the vote in contests that fell in mid- to late April, like Connecticut and New York.
And while that’s not a distinct departure from the statewide results described above, it’s not insignificant either. Depending on how frontloaded a primary calendar is, late April tends to be around the point where enough delegates have been allocated that the presumptive nominee is, if not already clear, coming into sharper focus. So if three candidates are still cresting above the 15 percent threshold by the six-contest “Acela primary” in late April, when more than 75 percent of delegates will have been awarded, that could wreak havoc on the 2020 Democratic nomination process.
But of course, much of this depends on how wide the margin is by which the candidates clear that threshold. If, say, only one candidate is getting a supermajority while the others struggle to hit 15 percent, then the fact that three candidates are above the threshold matters very little — see Trump in 2016. But if three candidates are tightly bunched at 40, 30 and 20 percent, it potentially becomes much more problematic. This is especially true if that clustering happens early and often, especially on delegate-rich days like Super Tuesday, which is scheduled for March 3 this year and is the first series of contests after the four early states.
But here’s why I think a logjam situation is unlikely: How the threshold is applied tends to already have a built-in winnowing effect on the candidates. Yes, there is a proportional allocation of delegates, but that only applies to candidates who win 15 percent of the vote. And that qualifying threshold is not applied just once, but three different times. A candidate must meet that threshold at the statewide level twice, once for at-large delegates and once for party leader and elected official (PLEO) delegates. A candidate must also win 15 percent of the vote in a given congressional district (or other subdivision) to lay claim to any district-level delegates. In other words, a candidate who surpasses 15 percent of the statewide vote by running up margins in a few concentrated areas will not earn as many delegates as a candidate who hits the 15 percent statewide threshold by earning at least 15 percent of the vote across districts. A candidate must build a coalition of support more uniformly across a state — and the country — in order to win delegates. It’s more than just peeling off a delegate or two here and there.
Over the summer, a national reporter asked me what impact it would have on the race if a candidate like Rep. Eric Swalwell (when he was still in the race) managed to pull enough support in his home district to clear the 15 percent threshold. My answer: Not much. If Swalwell received 15 percent of the vote in his Northern California district, that would net him one delegate — not enough to do a whole lot of damage.
So no, it’s not likely that more than three candidates surpass the 15 percent threshold statewide in any 2020 primary or caucus: The bar is just too high.
Ultimately, the 15 percent threshold is actually another way in which the primary field is winnowed. Just look back to when the current 15 percent threshold went into effect in 1992. Sure, there were 12 contests in that cycle where three candidates hit more than 15 percent statewide, but no cycle has come even remotely close to topping that since. In fact, since 1992 there hasn’t been a single cycle where three or more candidates have hit 15 percent statewide in more than a half-dozen contests. That is at least some evidence that the threshold has worked in winnowing the field, and there’s reason to believe it will work again here in 2020. If previous nomination contests are any guide, candidates drop out when it gets too difficult to accrue more — or any — delegates. And voters move on, prioritizing those candidates who can easily clear that threshold.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

1.3 million pension recipients
After three decades in mining, Joe Brown relies on a pension plan through the United Mine Workers of America that provides him and 86,000 other retirees essential monthly benefits that Brown thought he would have for the rest of his life. However, the plan is on track to be insolvent in only three years, and Brown isn’t the only one vulnerable to having his pension deeply underfunded. A new report by HuffPost shows 130 other multiemployer pension plans in the United States are also projected to be insolvent in the next two decades, affecting more than 1.3 million pension recipients.

$33,000 for a useless degree in law
Imagine attending law school classes, doing homework, studying complicated topics like torts and contracts for three years, and finishing with a $33,000 degree that wouldn’t enable you to be a lawyer? A BuzzFeed News investigation highlights several online law schools that offer an Executive Juris Doctor degree that won’t allow graduates to practice law or qualify them to take bar exams. “Trying to describe it makes you look like a goddamned fool,” Brenda Cuney told BuzzFeed News after graduating from the unaccredited Concord Law School earlier this year.

11 school days
Students in Chicago will return to class today after Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced the end of the teachers’ union strike. The five-year deal includes teachers making up five of the 11 missed school days and many of the union’s demands, including class size caps as well as nurses and social workers in every school. The Chicago Teachers Union has 25,000 union members who still need to vote to ratify the agreement. [Chicago Tribune]
$2 million library donation
Before he died, Philip Roth left two major gifts to the library in his hometown of Newark, New Jersey: at least $2 million from his estate, and his own personal collection of approximately 7,000 books. The Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist made both arrangements quietly before his death last year, but the financial gift was reported for the first time in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. A longtime friend of Roth’s and co-literary trustee of his estate, Julia Golier, said his hope was that the contributions would attract literary tourists and festivals to the city.

$4.5 billion write-down
One of the world’s largest tobacco companies has taken a large write-down of its investment in the vaping company Juul after buying a 35 percent stake in the popular start-up last December for $12.8 billion. On Thursday, Altria Group said it had devalued its investment in Juul by $4.5 billion due to recent bans on vaping across the United States and the likelihood the FDA would “remove flavored e-vapor products from the market.” Altria is the U.S. maker of Marlboro and has seen a decline in sales of traditional cigarettes.

8 more Deadspin staffers resign
Deadspin, the website that covered politics, culture, cleaning, food, and a wide variety of sports, continued to implode on Thursday after eight more staffers tendered their resignation. The losses followed Tuesday’s firing of interim-editor Barry Petchesky by G/O Media CEO Jim Spanfeller after Petchesky refused to follow a new, limiting mandate that would have eliminated the site’s popular coverage of many non-sports topics. Deadspin was a good website. [The Nation]

39 Vietnamese migrants
All 39 of the migrants found dead in the back of a refrigerated trailer in the UK county of Essex are believed to be Vietnamese nationals, according to the most recent police statements. The bodies of eight women and 31 men discovered on Oct. 23 were initially thought to be Chinese nationals, but 10 Vietnamese families contacted local police after losing contact with their relatives, prompting an investigation into human trafficking. Eamonn Harrison of Ireland has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, as well as human trafficking and immigration offenses. [The Telegraph]
13 years of homeownership
A new analysis from the real estate brokerage firm Redfin shows the typical homeowner in the United States now stays in their house for 13 years. That’s five years more than they did in 2010. This lack of movement, especially among aging baby boomers, has creating inventory shortages and pushed up prices. According to Redfin and the housing data firm CoreLogic, Salt Lake City, Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio and Dallas are the cities with the longest median homeowner stays, all more than two decades.

625 on the Air Quality Index
Government buildings and private schools are being closed today and tomorrow in India’s capital city of Delhi due to poor air quality. Measurements on the Air Quality Index were as high as 625, a new record for the season. Low visibility also resulted in 32 flights being diverted from the city’s international airport on Sunday.

1.1 million acres of land
Draft legislation could move 1.1 million acres of the Desert National Wildlife Refuge from being controlled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to the U.S. Air Force. The Washington Post reports that a legislative proposal would turn more essential habitat areas into locations for training troops and testing weapons. The draft bill would stop an environmental review that has happened every 20 years and exempt the area from wildlife refuge law, which critics say would render much of the desert reserve area “a refuge in name only.” [Washington Post]

The Mets Sure Hope So.,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"The New York Mets have a new manager: Carlos Beltrán, who also played for the franchise from 2005 through 2011. Beltrán returns to New York with a laundry list of recommendations from his days as a de facto coach on the bench for the 2017 World Series-winning Houston Astros — and he could have the highest ceiling of anybody the Mets might have hired this offseason. But his hiring does come with a potential pitfall, if MLB history is any guide:
He was a legitimately great ballplayer.
Although many Met fans will never forgive Beltrán for taking the called strike that ended the 2006 National League Championship Series, he ended up compiling 30.2 wins above replacement1 for the franchise in his career, which ranks seventh all-time behind only Tom Seaver (74.6), Dwight Gooden (51.3), David Wright (51.2), Jerry Koosman (37.9), Darryl Strawberry (36.2) and Jacob deGrom (34.3). Tack on the 38.5 WAR he earned at his other destinations — the Royals, Yankees, Cardinals, Astros, Giants and Rangers — and Beltrán established himself as one of the best center fielders in MLB history, a borderline Hall of Famer at the very least.
Beltrán retired with a JAWS score (a measure of Hall of Fame value that averages together a player’s lifetime WAR with his WAR from his seven best seasons) of 56.4 over his playing career. Since 1901, there have been about two dozen players with a JAWS as high as Beltrán’s who tried their hand at managing as well. The best, according to The Baseball Gauge’s “Manager Points” — which reward managers for winning games and advancing in the playoffs — was easily shortstop Joe Cronin (58.4 JAWS). Cronin played for the Pirates and Senators before Washington named him player/manager in 1933 — a role he resumed in Boston after he was traded to the Red Sox two seasons later. He ranks 43rd all-time in Manager Points, slightly behind new Phillies manager Joe Girardi — whom, coincidentally, the Mets reportedly passed on as a managerial choice last month.
Cronin was a rare success story for great players-turned-managers. The typical case in that category, however, turned out more like Eddie Mathews or Ted Williams, neither of whom were able to convert their considerable knowledge of the sport into a winning record at the helm of a team. (The same tale basically went for players as legendary as Ty Cobb, Cy Young and Honus Wagner.) Williams — who once famously said, “all managers are losers; they are the most expendable pieces of furniture on the face of the Earth” — did manage to lead the Washington Senators to a surprising 86-win season in 1969, his first year with the club. But he was unable to replicate that success in subsequent seasons, going an abysmal 187-288 over his final three campaigns before walking away from the managerial game.
Perhaps that shouldn’t have been too surprising. As we’ve seen in our other research about players-turned-coaches, there is surprisingly little relationship between how well players played the game and how effectively they can guide others to playing the game well.
Plenty of managers do come from a playing background, of course. It’s just that most of history’s greatest managers were mediocre players at best. Two of the all-time leaders in Manager Points, for instance, are former Cardinals skipper Tony La Russa and ex-Braves boss Bobby Cox — who combined for a grand total of 0.6 WAR in their playing careers. If you plot out a manager’s JAWS score as a player against his Manager Points in the dugout, very few achieved excellence in both categories:

Cronin is in that group, as are former Chicago Cubs player/manager Frank Chance (who, in 1908, led the last championship winner on the North Side before 2016); three-time pennant-winning New York Giants manager Bill Terry; and even Dusty Baker, who managed the Giants, Cubs, Reds and — most recently — the Nationals. So it’s not entirely impossible to be a good player who becomes a high-quality manager (though none aside from Cronin was quite as good on the field as Beltrán was).
The only truly runaway success story among players-turned-managers is Joe Torre, who was an MVP in 1971 and retired with a JAWS of 49.3. He is not in the Hall of Fame as a player, but he was close to checking off a few of the boxes that mark a career bound for Cooperstown. As a manager, he overcame a below-average start to his career on the bench to win four championships and six pennants with the New York Yankees in the 1990s and 2000s. Torre ranks fourth on the all-time list of Manager Points; he was inducted into the Hall of Fame for his managerial work in 2014.
So Torre was almost as good on the field as Beltrán and a rousing success in his post-playing career. Needless to say, Mets fans would be beyond ecstatic if their new hire’s managerial stint in New York mimicked Torre’s. But Torre is the exception to the general rule that great players seldom make great managers — and that the greatest managers came from humble playing roots.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-beto-orourkes-pivot-didnt-work/,2019-11-02,,,features,"Nov. 1, 2019",Why Beto O’Rourke’s Campaign Failed,Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Beto O’Rourke has played games with the media before, but he got a last laugh of sorts — at least a wistful chuckle — by dropping out of the presidential race on Friday afternoon, sending political writers into a tizzy right before the weekend. And although his candidacy once had great promise, O’Rourke’s exit from the race came down to his weak poll numbers and reduced fundraising numbers, as well as the fact that he may never have had the base of support he needed to truly compete for the Democratic nomination.
Coming off a close loss in Texas’s 2018 Senate race against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, O’Rourke entered the presidential race with great fanfare in March, though some wondered if he had waited too long to fully capitalize on the national notoriety he gained from his 2018 performance. Still, O’Rourke’s initial polling numbers suggested he might really be in the mix to compete for the nomination — he was polling at 10 percent or more in some national polls not long after he announced. However, his survey numbers quickly deteriorated as the race moved along, and he spent the past four months mostly polling below 5 percent even after he tried to revive his campaign in August by tacking left on some issues and focusing more on President Trump.
O’Rourke’s tumble in the polls was also accompanied by fundraising difficulties. Having been a prodigious fundraiser in 2018, he seemed capable of attracting the resources to run a top-level presidential campaign, and he showed early promise by raising $6.1 million in the first 24 hours of his campaign, the second best opening day after only former Vice President Joe Biden. But fundraising dollars started drying up shortly thereafter. He had raised only $13 million by the end of the second quarter, and added just another $4.5 million in the third quarter.
His debate performances didn’t help him recover either; in fact, his most recent performance seemed to have hurt him. After the October debate, O’Rourke’s net favorability among Democratic primary voters fell by about 6 points in our post-debate poll with Ipsos, the biggest decline for any of the 12 candidates on stage. His place at future debates was in serious jeopardy, too. O’Rourke was two qualifying polls shy of making the November debate and had yet to register a single qualifying survey for the December debate.
But O’Rourke might always have struggled to attract a large enough base of support in the primary given the makeup of the Democratic electorate. As a moderate three-term congressman, he won over many suburban white voters in his Texas Senate bid, but as editor-in-chief Nate Silver wrote back in July, a base of white moderates, particularly younger ones, wasn’t enough. As you can see in the table below, only about 12 percent of 2016 Democratic primary voters fit all three descriptors — young, white, moderate — based on data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study.1

This meant O’Rourke needed to make inroads with other groups to build a broader coalition, which might explain his leftward pivot on issues, particularly gun control. He made headlines in the September debate by calling for a mandatory gun buy-back program. It’s also possible that he shifted left because of Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s rise in the race, as the mayor has also tried to play to the middle. (Buttigieg’s surge in the polls in March and April also happened to coincide with O’Rourke’s decline.)
But the polls don’t lie: The pivot didn’t work. For a young politician who might be mentioned as a possible candidate in future elections, his leftward turn may have also damaged his ability to run for statewide office in Texas again, as it’s still a Republican-leaning state. Who knows where we might see O’Rourke next, but his exit shows that sometimes early campaign strength doesn’t pan out.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

A Few GOP Incumbents Look Vulnerable.,Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Senate Elections,"You might not know it from the headlines, dear reader, but the presidential contest is not the only election happening in 2020. Control of the U.S. Senate is also up for grabs, and the party in charge of Congress’s upper chamber could determine the fate of many of the policies currently grabbing attention in the presidential campaign. As we noted right after the 2018 election, Republicans are favored to retain a majority in the Senate in 2020, but Democrats also have a realistic — if difficult — path to winning back control. This is the first of a series of regular updates on what’s happening in Senate contests around the country, so let’s take a look-see at the latest developments.
First, the top-line situation. Republicans are favored to hold on to the Senate, as they currently have a 53-to-47 seat edge,1 which means Democrats must gain a net of four seats for outright control, or three seats and the vice presidency, as the vice president casts the tiebreaking vote. What’s more, the competitive races in the Senate in 2020 will probably be on Republican-leaning turf, which should give the GOP a baseline advantage. However, Democrats’ silver lining is that the GOP has to defend 23 of the 35 seats on the ballot next year, and election forecasters Inside Elections, Sabato’s Crystal Ball and The Cook Political Report currently rate Democrats’ opportunities to pick up seats more favorably than Republicans’. (Though Republicans, of course, can win the Senate by simply hanging on to the seats they have.)
And keep in mind that the presidential race at the top of the ticket may be critical in determining which party wins control because of just how nationalized our elections have become. In the 2016 election, for instance, every state with a Senate race backed the same party for both president and Senate for the first time ever.2

*Rating is the median rating among Inside Elections, Sabato’s Crystal Ball and The Cook Political Report.
**Special election
Open seats are ones with retiring or resigning senators.
FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric is the average difference between how a state votes and how the country votes overall, with 2016 presidential election results weighted at 50 percent, 2012 presidential election results weighted at 25 percent and results from elections for the state legislature weighted at 25 percent. Note that the partisan leans in this article were calculated before the 2018 elections; we haven’t calculated FiveThirtyEight partisan leans that incorporate the midterm results yet.
But declining approval ratings may be a warning sign for endangered Republican incumbents in battleground states. The partisan lean metric in the table above measures how much more Democratic- or Republican-leaning a state is than the country as a whole,3 and all five GOP senators defending seats in states with a partisan lean of less than R+10 saw their approval ratings worsen in the third quarter of 2019, according to data from Morning Consult. And all but one — Arizona Sen. Martha McSally — has a net negative rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating).

This is particularly worrisome for Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado, who will likely need some ticket-splitting in their Democratic-leaning states to win reelection. Most notably, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst’s net approval rating dropped about 9 percentage points, falling into negative territory, though it dropped the most among Republican voters, who may come back into her fold by Election Day. Democrats probably need to defeat most or all of these senators — North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis is the fifth — to capture the Senate, and they have to be pleased that the public image of these incumbents has taken a hit. Of the Democrats in currently competitive contests (that is, those not rated as “safe” for either party), only Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith saw a decline in her net approval, although it remains fairly positive overall (+13).
Yet it’s certainly not all bad news for Republicans. Recent polling in Michigan, for instance, suggests they have a real shot of putting the state’s Democratic-held seat in play. Two recent polls found Democratic Sen. Gary Peters barely ahead of or in a dead heat with Republican John James, who lost Michigan’s 2018 Senate race but performed better than expected relative to the Democratic lean of the national environment. Although another poll found Peters ahead by 16 points, so it’s not entirely clear yet how competitive this race is, but given that President Trump carried Michigan by 0.2 points in 2016, it should be a competitive environment where James could take down Peters, especially if he can once again outperform expectations.
But we’re a long way from November 2020, so plenty of curveballs could still shake up the Senate picture between now and then. Consider, for example, that former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reportedly considering a run for his old seat, which Democratic Sen. Doug Jones won in a surprise victory over scandal-ridden Republican Roy Moore in a 2017 special election. Major contenders for the GOP nomination — including Moore, who’s running again — aren’t inclined to get out of Sessions’s way just yet though, as his position in the party is somewhat complicated given Trump’s still-simmering anger over Sessions’s decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. If Sessions runs and Trump openly opposes him, that might make for a wide-open and unpredictable GOP primary. Jones, who is an underdog for reelection, would probably prefer the chaos, but we’ll know more very soon — the deadline to enter the race is Nov. 8.
As in Alabama, the eventual nominees in a handful of other races could influence how competitive they are. For instance, although New Hampshire is very narrowly divided between the parties (Hillary Clinton carried the state by less than half a point in 2016), election forecasters think Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is in relatively good shape to win reelection — the median race rating there is “Likely Democratic.” That’s partly because the GOP lacks a top-tier challenger there, but that could change if a high-profile Republican like former Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski jumps into the race. New Hampshire Republicans have said they worry that Lewandowski could harm the GOP ticket, but considering the razor’s edge by which Trump lost New Hampshire in 2016, Lewandowski’s entrance into the race while Trump is at the top of the ticket could make the seat less safe for Democrats.
Meanwhile, Democrats are hoping that state Sen. Barbara Bollier, a Republican-turned-Democrat who is their likely nominee, can run a competitive race for Kansas’s open seat despite the state’s strong Republican lean (R+23.3). And the GOP candidate most likely to make that possible for Democrats is former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who lost the state’s 2018 gubernatorial race. For that reason, national Republicans don’t want Kobach to win the GOP nomination, but thanks to the crowded GOP primary field, Kobach’s conservative base of support might be enough for him to win with only a plurality. The real Kansas wild card, of course, is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has done nothing to tamp down speculation that he might seek the seat. Pompeo is a former representative from Kansas and his entry might clear the GOP field — he doesn’t have a potential anti-Trump problem like Sessions.
As for the newest Senate race on the 2020 calendar — Georgia’s special election — there’s also a fair amount of uncertainty there. Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson announced that he will resign at the end of 2019, but Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has yet to announce who he will appoint in Isakson’s place. Some notable Democrats have entered the contest for Georgia’s other Senate seat (that’s right, both seats are up), but so far only Matt Lieberman — son of former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman — has announced a bid for the special election. Notably, Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath appeared to be preparing a run for Isakson’s seat, but decided to seek reelection to the House instead. Republicans are favored in both Georgia races, but Democrats will still want to have strong candidates contesting both seats in case the electoral environment is friendly enough to make Georgia a swing state. The close gubernatorial race between Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams in 2018 could portend a competitive presidential contest there, though Trump won the state by 5 points in 2016.
There will be many more twists and turns in the 2020 Senate race, so watch this space — we’ll be tracking all the ins and outs of the battle to control Congress’s upper chamber.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dolphins-threw-eight-players-into-a-blitz-were-they-trying-to-lose/,2019-11-01,,,features,"Nov. 1, 2019",The Dolphins Threw Eight Players Into A Blitz. Were They Trying To Lose?,Josh Hermsmeyer,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"On Monday night, the winless Miami Dolphins were headed toward halftime with a surprising two-touchdown lead. But for a Miami team that is widely believed to be tanking, leading the heavily favored 2-4 Pittsburgh Steelers may not have been a cause for celebration. Beating the Steelers might have boosted short-term morale among the players and coaching staff, but with the hapless Cincinnati Bengals also winless on the season, a victory could have potentially derailed the Dolphins’ plans for landing the No. 1 overall pick in next year’s draft. So with 26 seconds left before halftime, Miami general manager Chris Grier may have felt some small sense of relief after the defensive play that his head coach, Brian Flores, dialed up on third and 20 for the Steelers.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dolphins_zero_blitz.mp4
The Steelers lined up with three wide receivers and sent two out to the right side of the formation. Miami blitzed with eight pass rushers, leaving just three defenders in the secondary to cover the three receivers. With no help from a fourth defender, the defensive backs played well off the line of scrimmage to protect against deep routes. After the snap, right cornerback Xavien Howard and safety Nik Needham failed to switch responsibilities for the crossing receivers on the strong side of the formation. In the slot, JuJu Smith-Schuster ran a vertical route upfield and slightly toward the sideline, while Diontae Johnson, who was lined up further behind the line of scrimmage at flanker, ran a shallow slant toward the wide-open middle of the field. The result was an easy pitch and catch for a touchdown.
The defensive play call is uncommon enough, and the result so bad, that some commentators on Twitter immediately accused the Dolphins coaches of being complicit in the tank. After reviewing the tape, others disagreed, arguing that cover-zero blitzes — plays on which there is one coverage defender per receiver, and the rest of the defense rushes the quarterback — are poor evidence of tanking since they’re occasionally employed by successful teams. Who is right? Was sending eight rushers on third and long a viable strategy, or was it a questionable call made by a Miami team that should be under suspicion of in-game tanking?
The evidence suggests that the call was of dubious value if a team is attempting to win a football game. Rushing eight or more is actually quite rare in the NFL. Teams rushed eight players just 110 times on all downs and distances during the regular season from 2016 through Week 8 of 2019. On third-down passing plays over that same period, teams rushed eight or more just 33 times. And on third and 11 or greater — the situation most similar to the one the Dolphins faced — there have been just two plays called with eight or more pass rushers. And that’s counting the play run by Miami on Monday night.
Regardless of the call’s frequency, we can say with confidence1 that dialing up an eight-man rush on third down is the worst play that defensive coordinators can call if they want to prevent their opponent from scoring.

Third down is typically advantageous to the defense. On average, plays called with any combination of three to seven defenders rushing the passer cause the opposing offense to accrue negative expected points added.2 Only when defenses decide to rush eight and drop three into coverage does the offense regain the advantage. On those plays, the script gets flipped, and offenses net nearly a point per snap over expected.

Some have argued that the Miami play was sound based on the theory that an all-out blitz forces the quarterback to get rid of the ball more quickly, leading to shorter passes. But that’s not what we find. It turns out that if you want to minimize an offense’s depth of target, it’s better to drop eight or more into coverage than to rush eight.
Fans and analytics-minded observers, in particular, often scream and yell for NFL teams to be more aggressive, but in this case, conservatism appears to be the better choice. Especially on a third and long like the Steelers faced against the Dolphins, who were up two scores with less than 30 seconds remaining in the half, calling a high-risk, low-reward play doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. Unless, of course, the goal wasn’t actually to win. In that case, it was the perfect call.

Polls of the week 
Very few Republican voters favor the impeachment and removal of President Trump — only about 11 percent, according to our impeachment polls tracker. Democrats voted on Thursday to move forward with public hearings on impeachment and will likely use the hearings to try to boost overall support for impeachment. But it’s unlikely that impeachment gets much more popular without some Republican voters on board. So are GOP voters moveable?
Partisanship is as strong as ever, so it’s unlikely we will see a huge shift — like a majority of Republicans suddenly supporting impeachment. But there are indications that — impeachment aside — GOP voters don’t exactly approve of what Trump did with regard to Ukraine, so maybe some of them aren’t fully entrenched in their views.
Most notably, a Selzer & Co./Grinnell College survey of U.S. adults released this week found that just 7 percent of respondents said that it is OK “for political candidates in the U.S. to ask for assistance from a foreign government to help them win an election.” Eighty-one percent said it is not OK, including overwhelming majorities of people who live in rural areas (87 percent), evangelicals (85 percent) and Republicans (81 percent).
When pollsters mention Trump’s name in their questions, the results are more partisan. But even then, a solid bloc of Republicans object to Trump’s actions. A recent Suffolk University/USA Today poll found that nearly one-in-three Republicans said Trump’s phone conversation with the Ukrainian president was “wrong, but doesn’t rise to an impeachable offense” (22 percent) or “an impeachable offense” (7 percent).1
Perhaps the most obvious explanation here is that many Republican voters don’t necessarily agree with Trump pushing Ukraine’s government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son but don’t want him further investigated or removed from office. So the more a polling question raises the stakes and essentially requires respondents to say, “Trump is unfit for office and should be impeached,” the more likely Republican respondents are to align with the president.
An Economist/YouGov poll released this week fits this theory. The poll found that 14 percent of Republican adults think that Trump “purposefully” withheld military aid from Ukraine to force an investigation into the Bidens, and another 23 percent said that they are unsure. That means only 63 percent of Republican respondents took the completely pro-Trump stance that the president did not intentionally withhold the money. Similarly, 15 percent of Republicans think that if it’s proven that Trump withheld aid from the Ukrainians until they agreed to an investigation of the Bidens, that would constitute an impeachable offense. Another 20 percent say they aren’t sure.
But that poll also found that Republicans are basically unified in opposing Trump’s impeachment (81 percent) or his removal (83 percent). Similarly, Morning Consult/Politico poll released this week found that only 11 percent of Republicans think that Trump “abused his power to influence the 2020 election,” while 73 percent said he was “acting within his power.”
All this suggests a difficult path for Democrats to win over Republican voters on the subject of impeachment. Even if House lawmakers seize on some GOP voters’ disapproval of Trump’s conduct in the abstract, they must overcome voters’ strong loyalty to the president in selling impeachment.
Other polling nuggets 
According to the Grinnell survey, Vice President Mike Pence (44 percent of respondents view him favorably, 44 percent view him unfavorably) is notably more popular than Trump (42 percent favorable/54 percent unfavorable). Twenty-seven percent of voters view Trump very favorably, compared to 24 percent for Pence. Forty-four percent of respondents view Trump very unfavorably, compared to 28 percent who view Pence very unfavorably.
Pence was also more popular (38 percent favorable/43 percent unfavorable) than the president (43 percent/55 percent) in the Politico/Morning Consult poll.
Former President Barack Obama is very popular, according to the Grinnell survey (61 percent favorable/34 percent unfavorable). But the leading Democratic 2020 candidates aren’t: Biden is at 47/44, Sen. Bernie Sanders is at 49/42, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren is at 39/39.
23 percent of respondents to the Grinnell survey view Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, another 2020 candidate, favorably, whereas 20 percent view her unfavorably. However, 57 percent of voters said that they are not sure, perhaps suggesting they don’t know much about her.
89 percent of adults describe themselves as proud to be Americans, according to the Grinnell survey. Fewer describe themselves as believers in “America First” (70 percent), “afraid for the future” (62 percent), progressive (50 percent), gun enthusiasts (41 percent), feminists (38 percent) and socialists (19 percent).
50 percent of registered voters say that they are “definitely” or “probably” ready for a gay or lesbian president, while 37 percent say they are “probably” or “definitely” not, according to the Morning Consult/Politico survey. Acceptance of an agnostic or non-religious president is also relatively contested, with 45 percent of registered voters saying they are ready for such a president versus 41 percent who say they are not.
According to that same Morning Consult/Politico survey, 73 percent of registered voters say they are ready for a female president, 75 percent for a Hispanic president, 71 percent for an unmarried president (71/16) and 61 percent for a vegan president.
Attorney General William Barr is increasingly being cast as a villain by liberals, while Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who is essentially leading the impeachment investigation, is now the favorite target of some Republicans. But a significant portion of Americans say they don’t know enough about Barr (36 percent) or Schiff (36 percent) to have an opinion of either man, according to the Economist/YouGov poll.
According to a new CNN/University of New Hampshire poll, 57 percent of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters say that they are still unsure who they will vote for in the 2020 race. Twenty-three percent have already made up their mind, and 21 percent are leaning toward a candidate.
A plurality (47 percent) of New Hampshire Democrats view Sanders as most progressive candidate, with Warren next at 18 percent, according to the CNN/UNH poll. A plurality view Biden as the candidate best able to handle foreign policy (Biden is at 41 percent by this measure, with Sanders and Warren tied for second at 12 percent).
11 percent of likely New Hampshire primary Republican voters view Trump unfavorably, according to the CNN/UNH poll. His GOP opponents are more unpopular: 21 percent view former Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina unfavorably, 20 percent view former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois unfavorably, and 42 percent view former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld unfavorably.
Trump approval 
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 41.1 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 54.1 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -13 points). At this time last week, 41.6 percent approved and 54.0 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -12.4 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 41.5 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.5 percent, for a net approval rating of -12.0 points.
Generic ballot 
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 5.5 percentage points (46.4 percent to 40.9 percent). At this time last week, Democrats led by 6.3 percentage points (46.6 percent to 40.3 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.7 points (46.8 percent to 39.9 percent).

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-the-best-umpires-behind-the-plate-during-the-playoffs/,2019-11-01,,,features,"Nov. 1, 2019",Were The Best Umpires Behind The Plate During The Playoffs?,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"Major League Baseball umpires heard their job approval ratings plummet in Washington, D.C., during this World Series, culminating with chants of disdain from Nationals fans after missed calls on Sunday in Game 5. And that was before the controversial runner interference call on Washington shortstop Trea Turner in Game 6. Every decision, every call, every mistake is amplified in postseason baseball — and when the work behind the plate could affect the outcome of the game, everyone notices.



To be human is to be imperfect. Deciphering borderline pitches traveling at 100 mph and breaking balls that move more than ever is not easy. And there will always be errors made behind the plate unless humans are replaced with an automated zone (which MLB began experimenting with this past summer in the independent Atlantic League).
But one study tells us that MLB might do a better job of getting balls and strikes called correctly simply by employing different umpires in the postseason. Mark Williams, a professor in Boston University’s Questrom School of Business, looked at called pitches from 2008 to 2018 and compared the more than 4 million pitches against ball-location data provided by MLB tracking cameras.1 He calculated ball and strike accuracy performance for each umpire, producing a bad-call rate per umpire per season, and has launched an app that evaluates and updates umpire performance.
“Baseball has a problem behind home plate, too many ball-strike calling errors,” Williams told FiveThirtyEight.
MLB has disputed Williams’s findings. League spokesman Michael Teevan noted that the missed-call rates MLB uses internally differ from those of the Boston University data and that MLB’s methodology “takes into account the margin of error of the tracking system.” (Williams says that, via Statcast and PITCHf/x, he is using the same underlying pitch-tracking and zone data as MLB, and maintains that umpires miss far more calls than the league is willing to admit.) Teevan also said factors other than just ball-strike calls are important in determining which umpires are used in crucial postseason games.
In the postseason, there were 252 pitches called strikes outside the zone and 195 called balls that were in the strike zone. That’s 447 missed calls out of 5,459 called balls and strikes, a missed-call rate of 8.2 percent. That’s better than the regular-season miss rate of 9.1 percent,2 but those are still hundreds of errant calls influencing game outcomes.
Only three umpires who received an assignment behind the plate during LCS and World Series play ranked in the top 10 this season in missed-call rate, according to Williams’s data, though Nos. 11 and 12 did work home plate in the World Series. Three umpires who called LCS games ranked in the bottom half of MLB’s 76 full-time umpires, as did three umpires assigned to the World Series. And the postseason has featured four of the worst 15 game-calling umpires behind home plate.
Many of the game’s best ball-strike umpires are invited to the playoffs and placed behind the plate, but not all of them. Why not? Teevan said assignments are “merit based” but that the evaluation criteria goes beyond ball-strike accuracy. “A variety of factors [are taken] into account, including experience, skill sets, communication and situation-handling,” he told FiveThirtyEight.
That experience might be part of the issue. Williams found that less-experienced umpires often performed better than veterans in ball-strike performance. Moreover, Williams found that there was typically little change in an umpire’s year-to-year missed call rates, suggesting that improving umpiring skills is difficult. The average service time of all MLB umpires this year was 16 years. The umpires in the LCS who called games from behind the plate had slightly less experience, averaging 14.6 years in the league. But the average crept up again among World Series umpires, to 16.4 years.
Ball-strike calls are incredibly important. Offensive performance in the majors is tied to the count, and just one missed pitch can have a significant effect. During the regular season, hitters had a .351 batting average on a count of two balls and one strike, versus a .161 batting average on a count of one ball and two strikes — a difference of nearly 200 points in batting average. Moreover, umpires are responsible for calling more and more balls and strikes as fewer balls are being put in play because of the record strikeout levels of recent years. This season marked a record for pitches thrown in a season,3 and a record for the number of called strikes in a season.
As long as humans — and not robots — are behind the plate, a certain number of calls will be missed. But on baseball’s biggest stage, it’s more important to get them right.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Using a scoring system called Endorsement Points that weights endorsements based on their importance — for instance, endorsements from governors score more points than endorsements from U.S. representatives — Mr. Romney had accumulated about 44 percent of the endorsement capital through Sept. 23. But Rick Perry was not far behind him, at 30 percent, and had been gaining ground.

With Mr. Perry having struggled though a series of debates, however, he has received almost no endorsements since that date. He has accumulated just 13 Endorsement Points during the past two months, as compared with 167 for Mr. Romney.
Nor have any of the other Republican candidates, including Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain, made any real progress. Mr. Romney has dominated the period, picking up 75 percent of the Endorsement Points over the past two months.

Mr. Romney recently added the backing of Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and John Thune of South Dakota to his tally. He has also earned a bounty of endorsements from state officeholders and party officials in New Hampshire and Florida, although he has few in Iowa and South Carolina.
Overall, Mr. Romney has 55 percent of the Endorsement Points from Republicans who have endorsed a candidate so far. Although the pace of endorsements has remained somewhat on the sluggish side — meaning that there are plenty of governors, senators and key state officeholders who remain unaligned to a campaign — a candidate like Mr. Gingrich would have a lot of work to do if he wanted to catch up.

The reason these endorsements matter is not that voters care about them all that much about them in a literal sense; a swing voter in Jacksonville, Fla., is unlikely to have her choice swayed by a Romney endorsement from Representative Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan. Rather, they are a signal of party or institutional support as compared to popular support (which is best reflected in the polls).
Usually, these indicators are in strong alignment with one another by this point in the campaign. In nomination campaigns from 1980 through 2008, the correlation between the share of endorsements headed into the Iowa caucuses and a candidate’s vote share in the national polls has been about 90 percent.
They are not very well aligned this year, however. Although Mr. Romney has 55 percent of the endorsements, he has just 24 percent in national polls, excluding undecided voters, according to the latest Real Clear Politics average. Conversely, Mr. Gingrich has just 5 percent of the Endorsement Points but is at 27 percent in the polls, excluding undecideds.


Gaps of this magnitude are not common historically. Unless the measures are brought into better alignment in the next several weeks, 2012 will represent a key test between competing political science theories about how nominations are decided. Do party officials lead the process, eventually coaxing the voters to their preferred candidates? Or has popular support become the key driver and grown more immune to the establishment? As Mr. Romney’s party support has grown while his popular support remains stagnant, this is the question that the nomination turns upon.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Last February, we found out when we teamed up with the folks at EA Sports to turn a normal, lazy, non-athletic lout into a Madden NFL avatar. That lout happened to be me.
I attended a private, faux combine and was thrust into a series of simulations to figure out just how bad walk-ons like me would be in the NFL. While I ran around a football field in Florida, the Madden ratings team was measuring my football skills — things like throw accuracy, speed, trucking and kick power.
When the EA Sports people used me as a quarterback, the Giants went an average of 2.9 wins per simulated season. Now it’s your turn. Our sports podcast Hot Takedown is launching a crowdsourced challenge to find out if someone has stick skills so profound that they can use a weak, slow and inaccurate average-Joe QB to win it all. Watch us discuss the project here or listen to the latest episode of Hot Takedown; full details about the challenge are below.



‘Win with Walt’ Madden challenge details
The goal: Win the Super Bowl in Madden 2016 with Walt Hickey as your starting quarterback.
How to participate:
Make a custom player on a team of your choice with the Madden ratings below.
In the event we haven’t listed a rating — I wasn’t evaluated for several defensive categories — just enter the overall rating of 12 in that field.
Make this person your quarterback, on whatever team you’d like.
Release all other quarterbacks on the team and play through a season of football, make it through the playoffs and then win the Super Bowl on an All-Pro or higher difficulty setting.
Don’t egregiously cheat. That means don’t tinker with player ratings and don’t spend the whole season just running the ball. Mitigate my weaknesses and take advantage of my strengths (such as they are).
UPDATE (Sept. 9, 8:30 a.m.): A few people have written in to ask for more details in creating their Walt avatar. Here’s some more guidance:
Height, Weight, Age: 6’2”, 210 lbs., 25
College: William & Mary
Injury: If you are dropping all your other quarterbacks, you are allowed to give Walt a 99 injury rating. We’ve updated the spreadsheet below. You may also want to create a number of Walts for your roster in order to bring one in if your first Walt still gets injured.
Run/pass ratio: In the spirit of fairness, we advise that you try to pass the ball at least 40 percent of the time.
The entry: Email podcasts@fivethirtyeight.com with any details of your journey, strategy, photos, screenshots or videos.
The prize: The first person to do this gets a shout-out on Hot Takedown and a signed glossy of Walt Hickey in full pads mailed directly to your house, if you’re willing to give us your home address.

FiveThirtyEight’s own Walt Hickey has joined the ranks of Brad Johnson, Doug Williams and Trent Dilfer.
Sure, Walt did it in a video game, while the other three did it while wearing cleats in real life, but the taste of victory was just as sweet. Walt’s triumph is courtesy of two Madden savants, Tim Curry and Luke Barr, who answered the call on our sports podcast Hot Takedown a few weeks ago. We laid down a challenge to see if anyone could win it all in Madden NFL 16 with Walt as their quarterback. Curry and Barr turned Walt’s depressing player ratings into a championship.
Below are notes the two victors sent us about their journeys. As promised, we’ll be giving them a shoutout on this week’s podcast and sending them a signed poster of Walt in full pads.
Curry, who won with the Philadelphia Eagles, provides a thrilling game report:
I have done it. After smacking the Cowboys in the divisional game and beating the Seahawks in the NFC championship, Walt Hickey and the Eagles defeated the Buffalo Bills in an epic comeback, 21-17. After falling behind 14-0, Walt threw a pick with less than a minute left in the first half, leading to a Bills field goal. But the Eagles came out swinging in the second half, with Ryan Mathews taking a pitch from Walt 80 yards to the house. In the fourth quarter, Mathews hit another long option run, being caught at the 10. This time DeMarco Murray took it in for 6, bringing the game to 17-14 with just under two minutes to play.
After the Bills recovered the onside kick attempt, the Eagles brought the house to stop the run three times, using up all three timeouts, but getting the ball back at their own 20 with 1:30 left. This time it was a mix of Murray and Mathews leading the way, with Murray taking a short pass 20 yards and Mathews finding another 30 on a pitch. With just under a minute, DeMarco found the end zone to give the Eagles the lead. The defense held, and Walt Hickey was a Super Bowl champion!
And here’s Barr, who won with the Dallas Cowboys:
Some observations:
I ended with an 11-5 record, the 2nd seed and a first-round bye.
He cannot throw downfield. Any throw more than ten yards downfield was almost always intercepted.
The best routes to run were definitely screens and swing passes, he could hit those fairly reliably.
Curl routes against bad cornerbacks in man coverage were also okay, but if he missed, it was usually an interception.
I chose the Cowboys to play with because I thought the offensive line would help. Joseph Randle led the league in rushing with 1759 yards.
Before the season I signed free agents Aldon Smith and Terence Newman and traded a draft pick for CB Josh Robinson. Terence Newman led the league in INTs with 12.
Hickey’s quarterback rating of 42.6 was actually better than Matt Flynn’s who had a 40.2 rating on 76 attempts.
Of Hickey’s 1872 yards, 1457 were gained after the catch.
Here is Walt’s game log, individual stats and team stats.

Walt is galled that, as a New York Giants fan, he won the Super Bowl with the Eagles and Cowboys. But that does make him better than Tony Romo and Sam Bradford. So he’s got that, at least.
And there you have it. Once again, congrats to Tim and Luke. Now please go outside.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-up-15-warren-up-7-are-primary-polls-too-far-apart/,2019-10-31,,,features,"Oct. 31, 2019",Biden Up 15. Warren Up 7. Are Primary Polls Too Far Apart?,Laura Bronner,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Last week, two polls painted two very different pictures of the state of the primary race. A CNN/SSRS poll put former Vice President Joe Biden 15 points ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 34 percent to 19 percent, while a Quinnipiac University poll released a day later found Biden trailing Warren by 7 points, 21 to 28 percent.
As both The New York Times and The Washington Post pointed out, these are pretty large discrepancies for two polls in the field at roughly the same time (the CNN poll was in the field from Oct. 17-20, the Quinnipiac poll from Oct. 17-21). But trying to figure out which poll is more accurate is kind of beside the point. After all, these are only two polls of a primary that has been polled hundreds of times, and it isn’t necessarily a problem that two pollsters arrived at different conclusions.
In fact, we expect some differences between polls in pretty much any race, even if the differences are just caused by random sampling variability (since no two random samples are exactly the same). And we almost always see some outlier polls, as long as pollsters aren’t herding. But given that the spread between these polls was so large, it naturally raises the question of whether we should expect the polls to differ this much. Are these polls just normal outliers, or are they a sign that the polls overall are too spread out?
Short answer: The spread we’re seeing is definitely outside the bounds of what you’d expect based on sampling error alone. To arrive at this conclusion, I took all the national polls since the beginning of October1 and ran 10,000 simulations estimating how wide the spread of the polls “should” be for Biden and Warren based on the sample size of each poll.2 For each simulation, I calculated the standard deviation (a measure of the spread of the polls), resulting in a distribution of what we’d expect to see as a result of sampling error alone. We would expect the actual standard deviation of the polls to fall within these intervals 95 or 99 percent of the time. And as you can see in the chart below, the spread between all the October polls is way outside the range of standard deviations for what we would expect — for both Biden and Warren.
For example, with Biden, we’d expect the standard deviation for polls to be about 2 percentage points, but it’s actually 3.5 points. It’s a similar situation for Warren — we’d expect the standard deviation to be between 2 and 3 points, but in fact it’s almost 5 points.
That suggests that it isn’t just sampling error that’s driving the differences we’re seeing — it implies there are some real methodological differences between the polls. Pollsters regularly use different approaches to polling, sampling and weighting, which can often lead to different outcomes. This is actually a good thing, since there’s a lot of uncertainty about the electorate in 2020 and it’s important that different pollsters make independent decisions about how to analyze it. This is why it’s important to control for variations in pollsters’ techniques when analyzing individual polls. Each pollster’s preferred methodology tends to make its results lean a little toward one party or to certain candidates — these leans are commonly known as “house effects,” and they can help explain some of the variation we’re seeing.
If we account for house effects,3 it turns out the spread in national polls looks a lot more like what we’d expect it to. (Though it’s still on the big side, especially for Biden.)
The standard deviation of Biden’s polls is still on the high end, but after accounting for house effects, the spread is no longer that much larger than we’d expect — it’s at 2.4 points instead of 3.5 points. It’s similar for Warren, where the standard deviation is now at 2.1 points instead of nearly 5.
So what does this tell us about those CNN and Quinnipiac polls? In short, the fact that they found such different outcomes isn’t that big a deal. As you can see in the chart below, once we control for house effects, the overall spread between polls since May isn’t actually all that large. In fact, the spread of values for both Biden and Warren fall within a range we might expect. So don’t read too much into those two polls. Turns out they’re just the kind of outliers we’d expect to see in this range of polls.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

50/50 odds of legalizing marijuana
New Jersey state Senate President Stephen Sweeney puts the odds of a new bill to legalize recreational marijuana at 50/50. “I’m going to put my best effort into it,” he told NJ Advance Media during an interview. Opposition comes from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, but Sweeney said some legislators have already started preparing a backup plan that would pass a resolution asking voters to decide on legalization during the election in November 2020.

Minus 45 degrees in October
While some cities are worried about the effect of rain on trick-or-treaters, other American residents have had to pull out their late-winter parkas due to a wave of Arctic air swept through parts of the western and central United States. Early Wednesday saw temperatures dip to minus 24 degrees in Big Piney, Wyoming, and the community of Peter Sinks, Utah, recorded temperatures of a blisteringly cold minus 45 degrees. Utah meteorologist Timothy Wright said it appeared to be “the coldest October temperature on record anywhere in the Lower 48 states.” [USA Today]

The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library — a massive, 125,000-square-foot building holds records and artifacts from the Reagan administration including an entire Air Force One plane — is now also under threat by the wildfires in southern California. A blaze known as the Easy fire was burning near the library on Wednesday after flames tore through 1,300 acres of dry, dense brush and threatened 6,500 homes. Other major fires in the state include the Getty, which had destroyed 745 acres as of Wednesday morning, and the massive Kincade fire, which has grown to more than 76,000 acres. [Los Angeles Times]
30 petrochemical plants
A new joint-investigation highlights that while air quality is getting better in the U.S. it’s getting worse in states like Louisiana, where a cluster of 30 large petrochemical plants near St. Gabriel, Louisiana, are contributing to the problem. Resident Hazel Schexnayder has seen several neighbors suffer miscarriages and die of cancer, but the toxic air pollution in the area is getting worse as more petrochemical facilities and expansions have sprung up in the area. The report also notes “the problems are especially acute in predominantly black and poor communities, like St. Gabriel, but whiter and more affluent sections — like neighboring Ascension Parish — are hardly immune.” [ProPublica, The Times-Picayune, and The Advocate]
79.3 percent for gender and racial hiring practices
A new report gave the NFL’s racial and gender hiring practices its lowest score in 15 years. The latest annual racial and gender report card from the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport put the NFL at an overall score of 79.3 percent after a significant drop in the number of non-white head coaches and general managers.

Foul outs don’t happen that often during NBA games, especially to multiple players, but data shows the number of foul outs have dramatically risen during the beginning of this year’s season. In the 51 games played so far as of Monday night, there have been 21 foul outs. For context on how unusually high this is, if this pace of foul outs continues, the 2019-20 season would see a 60 percent increase over last season, which already saw a 40 percent increase in the number of foul outs from the year before.

Appalachian State already owns what many think of as the biggest upset in college football history, and at that point, the program was already coming off two Division I-AA (now the Football Championship Subdivision) national championships and on its way to a third.
But say this for the present-day Mountaineers: They are putting together a run that might make even those famous underdogs jealous. This year’s team is 7-0, with the pinnacle of its undefeated start coming in a road win at North Carolina — its first win over a Power Five opponent since the upset of Michigan. Appalachian State is No. 20 in both the coaches’ and Associated Press polls, the highest ranking in history for a Sun Belt Conference team, and this is no accident. The Boone, North Carolina, school is 48-11 since the start of 2015. Only Clemson, Alabama, Ohio State and Oklahoma have a higher winning percentage in that span.
The Appalachian State teams that won three-straight national championships established the program as one of the best in the FCS. Since the Mountaineers used those years as a springboard up to the Football Bowl Subdivision, they’ve redefined what’s attainable for a school of their stature. The perennial overachievers have finished 12 of the past 14 seasons with a higher Football Power Index than they started with. They’ve won bowl games in four straight seasons, the first four in which they were eligible, and their unblemished record this season has brought yet another stunning possibility into play. They could sneak into one of the marquee New Year’s Six bowl games, which means, arguably, that they might soon have a win better than the shocker at Michigan.
Here’s the situation: Appalachian State plays Georgia Southern on Thursday night, and then comes the Mountaineers’ last game as an “underdog” this season: at South Carolina on Nov. 9. South Carolina is 3.3 points better on a neutral field according to FPI, but Jeff Sagarin’s model would have Appalachian State as a 1.2-point favorite in Columbia. The Mountaineers already beat North Carolina, which beat South Carolina in the season opener for the two teams. “The fact that we do that with the resources that we have and the limits that we have on resources, compared to those that we compete against, at least in the state, it just adds to our blue-collar, chip-on-our-shoulder mentality,” athletic director Doug Gillin told me Tuesday.
FPI gives Appalachian State an 11.9 percent chance to win out, but that’s up from 0.5 percent on Aug. 31. If the Mountaineers beat Georgia Southern and South Carolina, take care of business against Georgia State, Texas State and Troy and then win the Sun Belt title game, they’ll be in contention for a New Year’s Six bowl bid.1 That would likely be in the Cotton Bowl against an at-large selection from one of the five major conferences.
The Mountaineers have gone from a middle-of-the-pack Southern Conference squad to an FCS dynasty to an FBS newcomer to a Sun Belt standard bearer, all in the past 30 years, largely because of continuity. From 1989 until last December, they had only two different head coaches: Jerry Moore from 1989 to 2012 and Scott Satterfield, Moore’s offensive coordinator, from 2013 to 2018. They’ve adapted their offensive scheme, sure, but they haven’t undergone a full-scale rebuild, partially due to personnel. The five recruiting classes (2015-19) that make up this year’s team each finished outside the top 100 in 247sports.com’s composite rankings, and this is still not a program oozing with NFL talent. “We’re a developmental program,” Gillin said. “Always have been, always will be.”
Then there was the biggest question yet about the sustainability of Appalachian State’s rise. Satterfield, who shepherded the program through the transition to the FBS with 48 wins in the first five years, left to become the head coach at Louisville and took five Appalachian State assistants with him. “You’re kind of riding a high, having a lot of success, getting more and more people on board and invested in the vision of being the best that we can be in the Sun Belt,” Gillin said. “And then we had to go hire a new football coach in December. I think you never really know how that’s going to go.” He chose a first-time head coach in North Carolina State offensive coordinator Eliah Drinkwitz, who has kept the momentum building.
When asked about the effect on his new program of the national recognition, Drinkwitz kept the focus on Appalachian State’s goals of winning the Sun Belt and winning a bowl game. In that sense, the program seems content to stay on its current course for now, rather than knock on the door of a bigger conference or stump for an opportunity to compete for the national championship. After all, the next conference realignment may not be until at least 2023, and no Sun Belt team is within striking distance of the playoff.
“Right now, we’ve just got to keep winning,” Gillin said. “Ninety-five percent of this is just, win.”
Still, the opportunities to win keep getting bigger, starting with the upcoming bowl game — and the Mountaineers could even face a familiar foe. Michigan is 6-2, and if it wins out, it would be in line for the at-large spot in the Cotton Bowl. Twelve years after Appalachian State first announced its presence, a second win over the Wolverines would likely push it to the next level. Though this time, it would hardly be a surprise.

With one loss apiece, Georgia and Florida are both in very precarious positions right now. Each still has a playoff probability in the low-to-mid teens, and each would almost certainly make it if they win out.2 So the Dawgs and Gators can still play their way into the national championship picture — but at the same time, another loss would pretty decisively end each team’s playoff bid. That basically makes this year’s installment of the “World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party” a playoff elimination contest. Florida is formidable: The Gators’ only blemish so far has been a loss to current AP No. 1 LSU, and Florida QB Kyle Trask has played every bit as well as Georgia’s Jake Fromm. UGA, meanwhile, is still licking its wounds after a shocking double-overtime upset loss to South Carolina three weeks ago. But ESPN’s Football Power Index considers the Dawgs the superior team, and our model gives Georgia a 57 percent chance of winning. As far as outside interests go, LSU — which has already beaten Florida (and would probably prefer not to face UGA in a hypothetical SEC title game) — would most benefit from a Gator win here.

It was Washington’s fourth win in Houston during the Fall Classic, making the Nats the first major men’s pro team to win four road games in any best-of-seven playoff series. And that only scratches the surface of just how remarkable the Nats’ run has been. At almost every stage of the season and playoffs, they had to grind against ridiculously long odds. Few champions ever fought harder for their title than this Nationals ballclub did.
We’ve written before about Washington’s early-season struggles, but it’s impossible to overstate how resilient the team was in digging out of a 19-31 hole in the standings on May 23. The Nats were 12 games below .500 — the second-deepest pit any World Series winner has ever climbed out of, trailing only the 1914 Boston Braves (who went 12-28 to start their championship season):

Washington also faced multiple moments of crisis in the playoffs. Perhaps the most memorable came in the Nationals’ very first game of the postseason, trailing late in the wild-card contest (with a mere 13 percent chance of winning, according to The Baseball Gauge) until Juan Soto’s single — and an ill-timed error by right fielder Trent Grisham — helped propel them past the Milwaukee Brewers and into the NL Division Series. Once there, the Nats faced an 11 percent chance of winning the series at their low point in Game 5 before once again coming up huge against Clayton Kershaw and the Dodgers to advance.
An NLCS sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals went more smoothly, with Washington’s series win probability never dropping below 50 percent after the opening few innings of Game 1. But the Nats made up for that with one of the most back-and-forth World Series seesaws in history.
Despite going in as one of the heaviest betting underdogs in World Series history, the Nats stunned the Astros at first. At their initial high point in the first inning of Game 3, Washington had a 2-0 Series lead and was at home for the next three games — which gave it an 83 percent chance of taking home the first championship in franchise history. But things could never be that easy. As the Series unraveled over the next three games in D.C., the Nats’ championship win probability fell to a mere 22 percent by the end of Game 5.
The last of that trio of games was perhaps the most crushing, as presumptive starter Max Scherzer was scratched late because of neck spasms, leaving Joe Ross on the hill instead. Our Elo pitcher ratings thought the drop-off from Scherzer to Ross caused the Nats’ probability of winning the game to fall by 8 percentage points, a big swing as far as starters go. And things got even worse in the initial stages of Game 6, with Washington falling behind 2-1 early. Midway through the do-or-die road contest, the Nats’ chances of winning the World Series were down to 14 percent.
But this team specialized in high-pressure comebacks — and in playing its best with the season on the line. So it should have been no surprise to see Washington storm back to win Game 6, then rally from down 2-0 (and another 13 percent World Series win probability) in the sixth inning of Game 7. All the Nats did this postseason was orchestrate clutch comebacks.

Including World Series Game 7, the Nationals went 5-0 in elimination games this postseason — and all of them were come-from-behind victories. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Washington is the first team in MLB history with five comeback wins when facing elimination in a single postseason. And that doesn’t even get into the caliber of teams the Nats had to go through, including the 107-win Astros (with their ridiculously stacked pitching staff) and the 106-win Dodgers. They battled — and beat — the likes of Kershaw, Walker Buehler, Miles Mikolas, Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and even Zach Greinke (who was rolling Wednesday night) along the way.
Add it all up, and we just witnessed one of the most improbable postseason runs in baseball history by one of the most entertaining teams in recent memory. In a season of supercharged megateams, the eventual champion was the one nobody saw coming — the team that simply couldn’t be killed, no matter how high the odds were stacked against it.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-learned-from-the-first-house-vote-on-impeachment/,2019-10-31,,,features,"Oct. 31, 2019",What We Learned From The First House Vote On Impeachment,Perry Bacon Jr.,FiveThirtyEight,Impeachment,"Today’s House vote to formalize the impeachment process, spelling out its rules and procedures, isn’t the impeachment vote. That vote — on whether to make Donald Trump only the third-ever president1 to be impeached — will likely come later, after the House holds public hearings. But Thursday’s vote still told us a lot about how the House impeachment is likely to play out.
Simply put, it’s a good bet that not much will change no matter what happens in the hearings. That’s both because Americans’ views on the president are very partisan (basically Republicans almost universally support him but a majority of country does not), and because many of the most damning details about President Trump and his administration’s dealings with Ukraine have probably already come out in the last month. The resolution on Thursday passed 232-196, with two Democrats and no Republicans breaking ranks, and it’s just hard to imagine many members switching sides.
So House Democrats didn’t just ramp up the impeachment process on Thursday. They put themselves on a course that almost certainly ends with a vote impeaching the president and imploring the Senate to remove him from office. With the major implications of this first step in mind, here’s what we learned from today’s vote:
Republicans are already unified behind Trump — unlike in past impeachment processes
In 1974, basically the entire House voted in favor of starting the impeachment process against President Richard Nixon. Literally. It was a 410-4 vote. The vote to start an inquiry against President Bill Clinton in 1998 wasn’t quite as bipartisan, but Clinton still saw 31 Democrats break with him and support an impeachment investigation.2
But none of the 194 House Republicans who voted on Thursday’s resolution to formalize the impeachment investigation of Trump cast a “yes” vote. This was not at all surprising. There’s that entrenched partisanship I mentioned earlier, and Trump’s popularity with the GOP base (and the fear that he’ll support a primary challenger against Republicans who break with him, as he’s done in the past). But additionally, many more moderate Republicans and those in closely contested districts lost reelection last year, so there aren’t a lot of Republicans left in the House who are ideologically opposed to the president or might feel electoral pressure to break with him. Only three remain in districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016: Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Will Hurd of Texas and John Katko of New York. All three voted against the inquiry:
I thought that perhaps one of the 19 House Republicans who are retiring after 2020 might support the impeachment investigation, since they don’t have to worry about a primary challenge or reelection. But those members still might want to run for another office as Republicans or join GOP-connected lobbying shops or conservative organizations, so they could still have reasons to maintain a reputation as Trump loyalists. There also just weren’t a lot of political incentives for House Republicans to vote “yes.” (And electoral considerations aside, surely some of the 197 House Republicans either don’t think Trump did anything wrong or don’t think it’s worthy of impeachment.) The fact that Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who left the GOP in July to become an independent, voted for the resolution illustrates, I think, that no one who aspires to remain in GOP politics could vote in favor of it.
For those who want to see Trump leave office, this unified Republican support of the president is another sign that he probably isn’t going anywhere — at least until the 2020 elections. It’s doubtful that Trump’s removal from office (supported by nearly half the country) will become more broadly popular as long as Republican elected officials are opposed to it and keep telling GOP-leaning voters that the president is being unfairly investigated. And a unified Republican vote against even having an investigation is likely to lead to a unified vote against impeachment itself. (Although I don’t want to rule out completely a handful of members voting for impeachment if some even worse evidence against Trump comes out.) With that kind of ironclad support for the president, how could even one Republican senator vote for his removal, never mind the 20 that would be required for the motion to pass?
Democrats are ready to spend 2020 as the pro-impeachment party, even in pro-Trump areas
Of the 31 Democrats who represent House districts that Trump won in 2016, all but two — Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey — voted in favor of the impeachment investigation. So did all the other House Democrats who participated in the vote. This wasn’t surprising either — I don’t think House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would have scheduled this vote unless most swing district members were on board. She is deeply concerned about boosting their reelection prospects.
I would expect nearly all these members to follow through and vote in favor of impeachment itself; just as with Republicans, the electoral incentives for Democrats are pretty clear-cut. First, support for impeachment is above 80 percent among Democrats. Thus, even in a Trump-leaning district, it’s very likely that the majority of Democrats there favor impeachment. So a Democratic House member voting against impeachment would risk irritating the core activists, donors, volunteers and liberal voters that she needs to win reelection. Secondly, no matter how strong an argument she makes, a member who votes for an impeachment investigation but against impeaching Trump runs the risks of annoying both Democrats and Republicans in her district, satisfying no one.
Leaning into impeachment is a risk for House Democrats. There’s a scenario — unlikely but possible — in which the Democratic presidential nominee loses key states in the Midwest and is defeated while the party keeps control of the House by winning suburban districts in blue states like California. This scenario, pre-impeachment, could have involved some House Democrats distancing themselves from the party’s nominee and casting themselves as able to work with Trump. But you probably can’t run on being able to work with Trump after you’ve voted to impeach him.
In 2018, the House Democrats campaigned against Republicans’ unpopular Obamacare repeal bill more than against Trump himself. But impeachment puts Trump, the person, even more at the forefront of the 2020 campaign — even for House Democrats not technically running against him.


All in all, I think Thursday’s vote is a pretty good representation of what we can expect from the House impeachment process: Party unity on both sides resulting in Trump’s impeachment. But just because the outcome seems clear doesn’t mean the process can’t be surprising. Remember the hearings on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court ? Remember a group of House Republicans last week forcing themselves into a closed-door hearing being held by the House Intelligence Committee, bringing their cell phones into an area where phones are banned for security reasons? I think we are going to see even more over-the-top shenanigans in the next few months, particularly from House Republicans, who know they don’t have the votes to win this political fight.
Now that everyone knows that the impeachment process in the House is likely to end with a party-line vote that the Democrats win, the hearings aren’t really designed to affect the votes of members. They are really a performance for the press and the public. So I would not expect a sober, somber process.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-understand-natural-disasters-in-a-climate-change-age/,2019-10-31,,,features,"Oct. 31, 2019",How To Understand Natural Disasters In A Climate Change Age,Maggie Koerth,FiveThirtyEight,Climate Change,"Fires, floods, polar vortexes and hurricanes — every season brings another disaster seemingly linked to climate change. But natural disasters happened before climate change, too. So how are we supposed to know which disasters are fated because of the stars, and which are fated because of 100 years of global CO2 emissions?
Since the calamities aren’t going to stop anytime soon, we figured it’d be helpful to give you a guide for how to think empirically about disaster news in a climate change era. We asked some climate scientists what they think the headlines get wrong or leave out. They offered four tips for thinking about natural disasters and climate change — tips they say can make the difference between feeling hopeless about the future and finding ways to change it.
1) No disaster is actually “natural” 
Or, at least, not purely natural, said Chris Field, an environmental scientist who was co-chair of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group. He’s literally written the book (well, the report) on climate change and disasters, and said that the “disaster” label is about what happens when nature and people meet — not what nature does, alone. A hurricane that strikes a sparsely populated strip of coastline isn’t the same as one that hits a major metropolis. A heat wave in a region that’s used to dealing with high temperatures is much less of a disaster than the same heat in a place where almost no one has central air. Thinking about the “natural” and the “disaster” as two separate things is important, experts told me, because it changes the way we respond. If our risks are about more than just what the climate and the weather does, that means there are more ways to reduce our risks. It’s not an all-or-nothing situation where we have to either stop climate change or encounter doom.
2) Climate change is “a” cause of disasters, not “the” cause
Behind every natural event that becomes a disaster is a tangle of causes — some natural, some man-made. Climate change might be a part of it, but it’s never the only thing going on. “When I look at any of these events and see the headlines, it’s almost always a situation where [the disaster] is caused by natural variability … and the climate change part of it is making it worse,” said Lisa Goddard, director of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University. For example, drought in the West is linked to an increased risk of wildfire, but the droughts we’ve seen over the last couple decades are natural cycles, Goddard said. Combine those with climate-change induced higher average temperatures, though, and you’ve got a natural problem made bigger by human-caused change. This kind of thing is what makes makes climate communication messy. You want people to take the impacts of climate change seriously. At the same time, the risks of a natural disaster are about more than just carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.
3) Don’t ask “how much,” ask “how likely”
It’s almost impossible to know how much of a disaster is caused by climate change. And that’s the wrong question to even ask, Goddard said. Instead, try and think about whether climate change has increased the likelihood or severity of a type of disaster overall, said Melissa Allen-Dumas, a researcher at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory who focuses on climate change and critical infrastructure. That’s because the answer to that question actually has an impact on how people and communities respond after a disaster strikes. Knowing whether or not a particular hurricane would have happened if not for climate change doesn’t necessarily affect how you rebuild. Knowing that climate change is raising the sea level and increasing the likelihood of coastal flooding, however, should.
4) When all else fails, think in terms of vulnerability 
Disasters don’t take place in a vacuum — their devastation depends on the vulnerability of the communities they affect. The consequences of a drought and high temperatures will be less severe if forests have been managed in a healthy way and the wilderness isn’t full of aging power lines. When you read about climate change disasters, pay attention to the issues that make communities more or less vulnerable. Those vulnerabilities are, in some cases, preventable ones. The way you think about a given disaster (and future possible disasters) changes if you know that.
Understanding vulnerability is also important to understanding the global impacts of climate change. When we talk about developing countries being more at risk from climate change, what we’re talking about is the vulnerability — and whether or not they have the resources to adapt. If you look purely at the monetary value, somebody who owns a house in Malibu may be more at risk from a climate change-associated natural disaster than a farmer in Bangladesh. But ultimately, Field said, it’s the farmer who has more to lose. Insurance, having extra money in the bank, having access to emergency services, and even just having the ability to move someplace else — all those things affect vulnerability, which, in turn, affects how big of a disaster a natural event turns out to be.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

For most of the short life of the impeachment inquiry, House Democrats have played their hand in a quiet, restrained way. But this week their polite game of Bridge turned into a televised World Series of Poker as the House voted to formalize the impeachment inquiry. It marks a turning point in the way that Democrats are playing the impeachment game: They seem more confident than ever that as testimony becomes public the facts of the matter will convince the general public of their side as they move to draw articles of impeachment against President Trump. It’s not a play without risk, though. And at first, Democrats delayed the vote in part because of the nervousness of some members in moderate districts who didn’t want a on-the-record vote — but one that was bound to happen at some point, given the accumulating pile of evidence against Trump and public opinion favoring an inquiry. The die, as they say, is cast (yes, we’re playing dice now, not cards. Keep up.)
The Democrats announced they would vote to formalize the hearings following a week of bad-news testimony for Trump. As a brief reminder (you can read last week’s Spin Cycle for the whole shebang), William Taylor, the chief envoy to Ukraine testified to devastating effect that the official American policy on Ukraine was being undermined largely by a Rudy Giuliani-led misinformation campaign. On Tuesday, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council’s top Ukraine expert won this week’s prize for biggest bombshell testimony. Vindman, who was on the line during that phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine, testified that he found the conversation inappropriate and had registered internal concerns over how Ukraine policy was being conducted. Vindman also testified that he submitted edits to the official memorandum of the phone call, but that a couple were rejected, including one that called to include the president’s mention of Burisma, the company on whose board Joe Biden’s son Hunter sat. On Thursday, another member of Trump’s National Security Council, Tim Morrison, the council’s top Russia and Europe expert, testified. Morrison, who announced that he will be leaving his position, was also on the line for Trump’s phone call with the president of Ukraine. He backed up Taylor’s testimony from last week asserting that Trump sought a quid pro quo from the Ukrainians.
Testimony to keep your eyes peeled for? John Bolton, Trump’s former national security advisor has been summoned (although not subpoenaed). It remains to be seen whether Bolton will willingly cooperate with the investigation (he’s said he won’t appear voluntarily), though he reportedly was alarmed by the back door Ukraine policy, telling one of his aides, “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,” referencing Trump’s ambassador to the E.U. and his acting chief of staff.
And how have Republicans been handling the move by Democrats to take things public? The words “kicking” and “screaming” come to mind. In response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement that the formalizing vote would take place, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement, “Speaker Pelosi is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew — that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding, refusing to give the president due process, and their secret, shady, closed door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate.”
During a floor speech on Thursday prior to the vote, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that the Democratic-led Congress was “abusing its power to discredit democracy … Democrats are continuing their permanent campaign to undermine [Trump’s] legitimacy.” The speech was an extension of what the GOP line on impeachment has been — an attack on the legitimacy of the hearings, rather than a defense of the president’s actions. Still, not a single House Republican voted with Democrats to open a formal inquiry.
And how did Trump take the news of the vote? He tweeted “READ THE TRANSCRIPT!” and “The Impeachment Hoax is hurting our Stock Market” and “The Greatest Witch Hunt In American History!” (which, as always, the victims of the Salem Witch Trials might take some issue with.) He also pinned a new ad on his Twitter feed from his campaign that slams Democrats for the impeachment inquiry but lauds Trump for, among other things, ordering the assassination of ISIS’s top leader.
“He’s no Mr. Nice Guy,” the voiceover intones, “but sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-warriors-still-win-without-curry-and-should-they-even-try/,2019-10-31,,,features,"Oct. 31, 2019",Can The Warriors Still Win Without Curry? And Should They Even Try?,Chris Herring,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"Just when you thought things couldn’t get any worse for the Golden State Warriors — who had already been on the wrong end of two blowouts in their first week of play and were headed for a third on Wednesday — worse came crashing down onto the floor of the new Chase Center.
In the third quarter, Stephen Curry dribbled to his left in transition, preparing to go in for a layup, when Phoenix Suns center Aron Baynes slid in front of the airborne point guard, causing him to tumble. Baynes then fell down, too, with his weight coming down on Curry’s left hand. The superstar couldn’t move his hand and walked to the locker room, and shortly after running some tests, the Warriors put out the news: Curry’s left hand was broken. He will be out for the foreseeable future.

On the most basic level, the injury is devastating for a struggling team that, until very recently, had it better than any other team these past few seasons — largely because of Curry’s impact. But even now, in the wake of yet another serious injury, there is reason for Golden State to have optimism. Aside from this being a hand injury, as opposed to a foot or a leg one, it happened early enough that the Warriors can gauge whether it’s truly worthwhile to make a concerted effort for a playoff spot. And if it isn’t, they can use the lottery pick they’ll get as a result of this wayward season.
So how hard should Golden State push ahead in Curry’s absence? All-Stars like Draymond Green and D’Angelo Russell are still there. Rotation pieces like Willie Cauley-Stein and Alec Burks just rejoined the lineup, while the Warriors hope that center Kevon Looney — dealing with neuropathy — can return to contribute at some point as well.
But the notion of the Warriors piecing things together without Curry is a difficult one. There is an abundance of young, inexperienced players in the rotation, with coach Steve Kerr repeatedly predicting growing pains. And the club, which already faced enormous pressure to score in bunches because of how porous the Warriors’ last-ranked defense has been, now faces the added challenge of trying to score without the game-breaking player who made its offense hum.
In losing Curry, the Warriors saw their RAPTOR roster rating fall drastically from the low 1600s (in the same range as contenders like the Los Angeles Lakers, Utah Jazz and L.A. Clippers) to a paltry rating of 1415, which leaves the three-time champions better than just five clubs: The Detroit Pistons (without an injured Blake Griffin), the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Atlanta Hawks (without an injured Trae Young), the Charlotte Hornets and the New York Knicks.

Time missed assumes that Curry returns at full strength. Our model also assumes that shooting guard Klay Thompson will be back for the playoffs.
FiveThirtyEight’s NBA prediction model still gives the Warriors a 54 percent chance to make the postseason, but that’s partly a function of not yet knowing how much time he’ll miss. Curry is expected to miss at least two weeks, but based on other players who have had similar injuries in recent years,1 he could be out as long as two months. Our model aims to bridge that gap and account for both ends of the spectrum.
The model projects that Curry’s absence will cost the Warriors about one half win per week he misses. Based on that, the team’s probability of making the playoffs would likely fall beneath 50 percent after he misses five weeks of time, when Golden State is projected to finish with only 43 wins.
With all this in mind, don’t be surprised if, depending on how much time Curry is expected to miss, you hear speculation about Russell being traded, or about Green getting considerable rest. The 1996-97 Spurs, who had picked up 121 wins in the two prior seasons, went 20-62 in the wake of a serious early-season injury to center David Robinson. Doing so landed them in the lottery, which they won, allowing San Antonio to draft someone named Tim Duncan. And in the 22 complete seasons since, the Spurs haven’t missed the playoffs. Even if Golden State owner Joe Lacob dismisses the idea of bottoming out for a year, there’s no doubt that being able to draft another potential star would be hugely beneficial to the Warriors, who have considerable money tied up in future years due to the hefty contracts of Curry, Klay Thompson, Green and Russell.
This isn’t our way of saying a broken hand in October should end Curry’s season. If anything, it’s merely a suggestion that the Warriors — who also have shooting guard Thompson on the mend after his ACL injury — should feel no need to rush back either player for the sake of this season, which has gotten off to a pretty disastrous start. Depending on how Golden State comes out of this process, it could end up extending their dynasty in a way that none of us initially saw coming.

Six snails are situated at the corners of a regular hexagon whose sides are all 10 meters. Each snail is determined to reach its clockwise neighbor, and they all travel at the same speed. But keep in mind that as each snail moves along, slowly but surely, the snail it’s traveling toward is also moving toward another snail.
The result is six snails — and six trails of slime — that spiral inward toward the center of the hexagon, as shown in the animation below:

Riddler Classic
From Julien Beasley, a new spin on the Sultan’s Dowry Problem, a classic problem of matrimony:
The sultan has asked her vizier to present her with 10 candidates for marriage. The vizier has searched the kingdom for the 10 most desirable partners, but he does not know whom the sultan will prefer. If she saw them all at the same time, she would easily be able to rank them from 1 (the best partner) to 10 (the worst partner). But the vizier can only present the candidates one at a time — very hard to sync everybody’s calendars, even back then — and in a random order. Upon seeing each candidate, the sultan must reject or accept him. If a candidate is rejected, the sultan cannot pick him again. But on seeing each new candidate, she knows exactly where he’d stack up relative to the candidates she has rejected. If she strategizes, what’s the highest rank she can expect her chosen candidate to have on average?
For example, if she simply accepted the first candidate presented to her, his rank could be anywhere from 1 to 10 with equal probability, averaging to 5.5. Surely she can do better…

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏Jack Altman 👏 of Chicago, Illinois, winner of last week’s Riddler Express.
Last week, you were challenged to find the volume of the solid inside the unit cube below, as unwittingly illustrated by artist Sol LeWitt. This time, I’ve included labels for the solid’s eight corners.
This challenge seemed straightforward enough, but there was one slight problem I hadn’t seen coming. As noted by solver Ziyad Gower, the top face (ABCD) of the solid was not flat! That meant the top face had to be curved or kinked. Don’t believe me? Check out the animation below, showing how the four corners of that top face don’t lie in the same plane.
Because you can’t tell how the top face is curved from the picture, I accepted a range of answers. The two extremes are when the top face is kinked inward (so that corners B and D connected along a straight edge) and when the top face is kinked outward (so that corners A and C are connected along a straight edge). Here’s one more animation, which continuously flips back and forth between the two extremes:
One way to find the volumes of these extremes is to break the solid up into smaller prisms and tetrahedra, find their volumes, and then add these values back up. The two extremes turn out to be very close in volume: 38/96 and 39/96, both of which are approximately 0.4. Given the ambiguity of the picture, solver Jack’s answer of 0.396 was as good as any.
Finally, submitter Eli Luberoff also created an interactive three-dimensional graph that calculates the solid’s volume if the top face were flat. Had that been the case, this riddle would have been much more fair.
That Sol LeWitt was a pretty tricky artist. The next time his work shows up in this column, I’ll make sure to file it as a Riddler Classic.
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏Kyle Tauzer 👏 of Orlando, Florida, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic.
Last week I wanted to carve the perfect eye for my jack-o’-lantern. The eye had to be a proper triangle, meaning the three corners were connected by “straight” arcs that went directly from one corner to the next via the shortest possible path. I also wanted it to be equilateral (meaning all three sides had the same length) and equiangular (all three corner angles had the same measure). My original carving, seen below, had three 90-degree angles, but resulted in an eye that was too large, taking up an eighth of the pumpkin’s surface area.
Instead, I wanted an eye that took up one-sixteenth of the pumpkin’s surface area. What, then, were the angles between my three cuts?
First off, if you imagine cutting a very, very tiny triangle on the pumpkin’s surface — so tiny that you have to zoom in to see it — it’s almost like cutting a triangle out of a flat surface. It’ll be the typical equilateral triangle you learned about in geometry class, with three equal angles that measure 60 degrees. As the triangle gets larger, and the curvature of the sphere is no longer negligible, the three angles get bigger.
Surprisingly, the relationship between the triangle’s area and the measure of its angles is linear. For every degree the angle increases, the resulting triangle covers an additional 5/12 of a percent of the sphere. To see why this is true, check out Hector Pefo’s excellent write-up, which looks at overlapping pieces of the sphere called “lunes.”
To carve an ideal pumpkin eye that’s exactly one-sixteenth of the pumpkin’s surface area, the three angles must each be 75 degrees. Some solvers were even able to find the solution in their head, noting that a triangle that takes up one-sixteenth of the sphere has an area that’s halfway between zero (when each angle is 60 degrees) and one-eighth (like my original eye, where each angle was 90 degrees). Halfway between 60 degrees and 90 degrees is, sure enough, 75 degrees.
Any which way you carve your pumpkin, Happy Halloween from the Riddler!

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/winners-and-losers-in-our-updated-nba-season-predictions/,2019-10-30,,,features,"Oct. 11, 2019",Winners And Losers In Our Updated NBA Season Predictions,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"On Thursday, we rolled out our new NBA metric, named RAPTOR — the Robust ​Algorithm (using) ​Player ​Tracking (and) ​On/Off ​Ratings — along with our new 2019-20 RAPTOR-fueled player and team forecasts, and a thorough explanation of the system from my boss, Nate Silver. But since we released an early, pre-RAPTOR version of our predictions back in July, I wanted to dig into some of the biggest changes that our new method has brought to the team forecasts on the eve of the regular season.
What changed?
As I mentioned above, we have posted a very detailed explanation of the RAPTOR metric. In short, though, we think this new system is an upgrade over our old CARMELO forecasts (which were powered by ESPN’s Real Plus-Minus and Box Plus/Minus data from Basketball-Reference.com) because RAPTOR uses not just the box score metrics but also player tracking numbers from the NBA and play-by-play data beyond just plus/minus (which it also incorporates).
These modifications mean a comprehensive implementation of shot defense — in the form of our DRAYMOND stat — to go with details like defensive credit or blame depending on which offensive player we estimate a defender was assigned to; the value of an assist and made basket varying by the type of shot; the value of a rebound depending on whether it was contested or deferred; extra value assigned to events outside box scores like offensive fouls drawn; an extra penalty for using up a team’s time of possession without generating a valuable offensive action, etc. The laundry list of small-but-important elements we’ve included in RAPTOR is quite long.
Who was affected?
In practical terms, this has resulted in certain players seeing a boost in value, while others have suffered a decline. I plan to write more on the players who’ve changed the most under RAPTOR in the future, but one big takeaway is that big men are, broadly speaking, going to be viewed as less valuable than they were before, while perimeter players look more valuable. Of the 100 players who lost the most per-possession value in the switch from RPM/BPM to RAPTOR, 60 are centers and 32 are power forwards. Meanwhile, of the 100 players whose ratings improved the most, 43 are point guards, 41 are shooting guards and 13 are small forwards.
Why? In general, RAPTOR gives more credit to players who create shots — for themselves and others — and takes the corresponding amount away from the players who benefited from those acts of creation. (For instance, big men with low usage rates and a high rate of assisted field goals can tend to be less valuable than their personal efficiency metrics suggest.) It also puts more emphasis on floor spacing, so bigs who can’t shoot become less valuable than you’d expect based on the rest of their stats. On defense, rim protection remains important, but RAPTOR has also added more precise measures of perimeter D, meaning good wing defenders have taken away some value from defensive bigs in the zero-sum ratings game. And finally, RAPTOR recognizes that not all rebounds are created equal, reducing the value of some players’ rebounding stats if a disproportionate number of their boards are uncontested.
All of these changes mainly benefit teams whose stars are primarily two-way perimeter players — think Kawhi Leonard or Paul George (hello, Clippers!) — and hurt those whose top players can’t shoot (sorry, Ben Simmons), don’t create much of their own offense (Al Horford) or are overrated by standard metrics on defense (Russell Westbrook … and, dare I also say, LeBron James???). The changes weren’t huge across the entire league — the typical team’s over/under win total changed by +/-1.8 wins on average because of the new metric — but there were a few important cases where a team’s outlook was affected more than a little by RAPTOR.
Winners and losers
The biggest winner from this change has to be the Los Angeles Clippers, whose odds of winning the NBA title have risen from a paltry 5 percent in our way-too-early summer forecast to 17 percent in the official preseason prediction. (They went from ranking fourth in the West alone by championship odds to second in the entire league.) The biggest reason is that RAPTOR really likes Leonard and George more than other advanced metrics do:

RAPTOR was much higher on both players than either RPM or BPM last season, and that’s generally been the rule for the past handful of years. (RAPTOR also thinks Leonard and George will get much better in the playoffs, with each improving their player ratings by more than a half-point per 100 possessions in the postseason.)
Other teams who look better under RAPTOR include the Oklahoma City Thunder, whose core of Chris Paul, Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Steven Adams, Dennis Schroder and Andre Roberson all saw a ratings bump when we plugged in the RAPTOR numbers — although at 2 percent to win the West, it probably still won’t matter for OKC. Among those teams that have an actual shot at the title, the Milwaukee Bucks’ championship odds are up by 5 percentage points, the Denver Nuggets are up by 3 points, and the Rockets are up by 2 points.

Team differences include the effect of RAPTOR plus personnel changes and other slight algorithm tweaks.
But for every team whose fortunes improved under our new metric, there have to be others who look worse based on the updated forecast. Chief among those is the Philadelphia 76ers, who were championship favorites in the summer with a 27 percent chance of winning it all — but now they are only fourth in title odds, at 11 percent.
What exactly happened to the Sixers? Joel Embiid still rates as a star; his RAPTOR wins above replacement of 13.3 ranked him among the NBA’s top 10 players last season. And newcomer Josh Richardson looks a lot better in RAPTOR than in more conventional advanced stats. But RAPTOR likes the rest of Philly’s heavy hitters a lot less, including Tobias Harris (whose projected plus/minus decreased by 0.2 points per 100 possessions under RAPTOR); Mike Scott (-1.0); Horford (-1.5); and, of course, Simmons, whose decline of 2.4 points per 100 possessions under RAPTOR ranks him as one of our new metric’s biggest victims.
Why does RAPTOR hate Simmons? His lack of floor spacing ability (zero career 3-pointers — not including the preseason) is held against him on offense, as are his many turnovers and his high time of possession relative to points generated. At the same time, very few players saw their defensive value drop more under RAPTOR than Simmons, who ranked 15th among point guards in defensive RPM but actually graded as a well-below-average defender according to RAPTOR. His poor defensive plus/minus plays a role there, but the “box” portion of defensive RAPTOR — which includes shot defense, opponent production, adjusted rebounding and offensive fouls drawn — hurt his rating just as much. More than perhaps any other current player, Simmons might be the poster child for somebody whose advanced metrics look worse and worse as you add more and more factors from player tracking and play-by-play data.

Beyond Simmons and the Sixers, the Los Angeles Lakers are the other team whose forecast is much more bearish after our switch from CARMELO to RAPTOR. And the reason is shocking: LeBron James looks worse in RAPTOR than other metrics! Specifically, it thinks James has lost a lot of value at the defensive end over the past few seasons:

Unlike in an earlier version, our new forecast is also calling for James to suffer an age-based decline, like many of his most similar historical comparables did in their age-35 seasons. Whatever the reason for King James’s lack of RAPTOR love, the Lakers are second only to the 76ers in terms of teams that lost the most championship probability and projected wins between our old model in the summer and our new model now. (It’s an especially bitter pill because, again, the crosstown rival Clippers were the team who benefited the most from the switch.)
Even so, we give the Lakers the seventh-best title odds of any team, which at least places them among a deep group of contenders in the West, headlined by our new championship favorite — the Houston Rockets. (RAPTOR is down on newcomer Westbrook but very high on James Harden.) The Bucks are the new favorite in the East, though the Sixers are still right behind them in terms of finals odds (30 percent to the Bucks’ 39 percent) despite being hurt by RAPTOR.
In other words, there are a lot of intriguing teams out there! Going into the season, our shiny new forecast gives five different clubs — the Rockets, Clippers, Bucks, Sixers and Warriors — at least a 10 percent chance of winning the NBA title, with six more at 1 percent or better and nobody over Houston at 26 percent. For comparison, the Warriors went into last season with a whopping 49 percent title probability, and only two teams were in double-digits; two seasons ago, Golden State was at 39 percent with three teams in double-digits; three seasons ago, the Warriors were at 55 percent (!) with only two teams in double-digits.
So no matter what happens, this should be one of the most wide-open NBA seasons in recent memory — and RAPTOR will help you keep track of the best players and teams all year long.

That means we have a brand-new set of detailed stats for every player since 2013-14 based on player-tracking data, as well as historical stats for every player in every season going back to the NBA-ABA merger in 1976 … and we have to do something with that, right?
So let’s run down our new metric’s rankings of the best (and worst) players and seasons in our new data set. We’re going to explore older stats dating back to the merger in a later installment. But first, let’s start by just focusing on the six-season period for which we have full player-tracking data from the NBA.
This period offers the best, most refined version of RAPTOR, and the one that, because it uses more data, varies most from other popular advanced metrics such as Real Plus-Minus, Box Plus-Minus and Win Shares. So who are the best players of the past six seasons? According to RAPTOR wins above replacement (WAR), Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors has been the most valuable, checking in with 120.0 WAR between the regular season and the playoffs, followed by Houston’s James Harden (107.9) and LeBron James of the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Lakers (93.2).

LeBron has undoubtedly been the NBA’s biggest star in recent years, so ranking him behind Curry (and Harden) might be unexpected. You could make a strong case, though, that Curry is the NBA’s most transformational player of the past half-decade. Sure, RAPTOR might be overstating his defensive value, but it should be no surprise to see Steph’s unparalleled offensive impact carry him to the top of the list. The names that stick out are probably Draymond Green at No. 5 — ahead of Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard — and Kyle Lowry at No. 8, ahead of Paul George and Russell Westbrook. (Danny Green in the Top 20 is also likely to raise some eyebrows.) Draymond is there by virtue of his outstanding defense — so good we named a metric after it — and a league-best 25.9 playoff WAR throughout Golden State’s many finals runs. At the same time, Lowry is the king of the little things that RAPTOR gives extra credit for, and Danny Green is the quintessential 3-and-D wing that our new metric loves.
Since we break out modern-era RAPTOR into two components — “Box” (based on individual stats, such as box score and tracking information) and “On/Off” (based on plus/minus data) — we can also say which players received more of their value from each component. For instance, if you look at players whose individual components of their RAPTOR ratings were larger than the plus/minus-based components, Harden and DeMarcus Cousins had the biggest gaps. (Pau Gasol and, ironically, a quintet of current and former Toronto Raptors — Jeremy Lin, Jonas Valančiūnas, Marc Gasol, Kawhi Leonard and DeMar DeRozan — round out the top of the list.) Meanwhile, Kyle Korver, Jrue Holiday, DeAndre Jordan, Draymond Green (no surprise, see above), Robert Covington, Patty Mills and the King himself, LeBron James, were the players whose on-court impact exceeded their individual numbers by the largest margins.
As for the best single RAPTOR seasons of the tracking-data era, you can find a gigantic searchable table in editor-in-chief Nate Silver’s story introducing RAPTOR last week, but the cream of the crop belonged to Curry, Harden, Chris Paul, James and — again, somewhat surprisingly — Draymond Green (specifically, his 2016 season). Although the traditional metrics consider Green good but not great that year (his Player Efficiency Rating didn’t even crack 20.0, which is the mark of a “borderline All-Star” according to PER creator John Hollinger), we think Draymond was extremely valuable to the Warriors. He played a mind-boggling number of minutes — nearly 35 per game for 81 regular-season games, plus 38 per game over 23 playoff contests — and he made up for whatever shortcomings in his box score numbers by coaxing the best out of Golden State while he was on the court. Green’s +15.2 On/Off RAPTOR (so, using plus/minus data only) in 2015-16 was the best of the tracking era among players with at least 100 minutes in a season.

There are some surprising omissions from the list, including MVP seasons from Giannis Antetokounmpo (14.3 WAR) last season and Russell Westbrook (15.3 WAR) in 2016-17. Also, “only” three LeBron seasons crack the Top 20 since 2013-14, which feels low since we are including the playoffs and James-led teams made the NBA Finals five times in those six seasons. But most of the usual suspects are indeed present, including four entries from last season alone (courtesy of Harden, George, Nikola Jokić and Curry).
We’d be remiss if we didn’t also touch on the worst seasons of the tracking-data era. On a rate basis (minimum 500 minutes), then-Memphis Grizzlies point guard Kobi Simmons checked in with the worst modern RAPTOR rating for his 2017-18 performance, which was 9.8 points worse than average. Simmons was mediocre-to-bad in basically every statistical category, except free-throw shooting (he made all 25 attempts!), and his team was outscored by more than 17 points per 100 possessions he was on the court. Enough said.
But in terms of total value, the battle for the worst campaign of the modern era was staged last season between the Knicks’ Kevin Knox and the Cavaliers’ Collin Sexton. Knox put in a good effort — he was worth -6.0 WAR, so bad that we had to change our chart scale on his player forecast page to accommodate the value. But Sexton was worth a staggering 7.4 wins below replacement, easily the worst season not just since 2013, but in the entire post-merger period. Sexton was a rookie, and he did improve some as the year went on, so we should cut him some slack. But on a terrible Cavs team that lacked much in the way of alternatives, Sexton played more than 2,600 minutes at a -8.3 RAPTOR plus/minus rate, a recipe for possibly the worst season in NBA history.

RAPTOR Picks The Best NBA Players Of The Past 40 Years.,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"Now that we’ve thoroughly broken down the best and worst — sorry again, Collin Sexton — players of the player-tracking era (since 2013), let’s zoom out to look at a larger slice of NBA history.
As a refresher, we just introduced a new player rating metric, RAPTOR — the ​Robust ​Algorithm (using) ​Player ​Tracking (and) ​On/Off ​Ratings. As part of that, we needed to create historical RAPTOR estimates for players who would show up as comparisons for current stars. These estimates were built by figuring out how the limited data kept in earlier eras (box score plus team data and RPM for 2001-2013, and just box score/team data from 1977-2000) relates to modern RAPTOR ratings.
These ratings are not perfect. And as FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver noted in his RAPTOR explainer, they raise an interesting philosophical conundrum: Does the act of retrofitting modern ratings to older players actually measure those players’ true, contemporary value … or does it simply find the historical players whose games would best fit into the modern NBA? (I don’t have a great answer for that; the truth is probably somewhere in between.)

But they do give us a brand-new set of historical stats for every player in every season going back to the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. So let’s take our historical RAPTOR ratings at face value and assume they function as solid contemporary measures of performance. Who, then, is the GOAT? LeBron? Jordan? Kobe? Someone else?
Instead of simply adding up WAR, like we did for the six-year period we wrote about last week, we should make an adjustment to better handle the scope of entire careers. To that end, I’m borrowing a page from baseball’s book and adopting the JAWS Hall of Fame metric, which averages together a player’s career WAR with his best seven (nonconsecutive) seasons to balance between total and peak value. If we do this with RAPTOR, here are the leaders since 1973-74:

This is not a definitive ranking, or even necessarily the best way to balance between peak and career WAR. But it’s a starting point for conversation, and it gives us a general idea of the kinds of players RAPTOR likes. (Feel free to download our RAPTOR data and make your own ranking!) Let’s break down some of this list’s most eye-catching results, one by one:
MJ over LeBron? I want to make one thing clear: I have long been a LeBron James backer, even in The King’s darkest days. And RAPTOR plus/minus thinks James was slightly better on a per-possession rate in 2008-09, his best career season, than Jordan was in 1990-91. (LeBron’s playoff performance that year was legendary even in defeat.) But of the top eight RAPTOR WAR seasons by either Michael Jordan or James, seven belong to MJ. Jordan routinely played many more minutes in his best seasons than James did, and he was usually more effective per possession as well — particularly on defense, where LeBron was never as good as Peak MJ and has fallen off quite a bit in recent seasons.

John Stockton, No. 3????? This is probably the most shocking item on the list. Many observers don’t even consider Stockton a top-three point guard, much less third on an overall list of players. I’m not saying I fully buy this, either, and maybe the JAWS approach is still giving a little too much credit to Stockton’s extremely long career (19 seasons and 47,764 minutes). But there’s also reason to believe that traditional analyses don’t give Stockton anywhere near as much credit as he deserves. First, he was ridiculously durable, playing in 1,504 out of a possible 1,526 games in his career (98.6 percent). He also excelled at many of the aspects of NBA offense that RAPTOR adores, including passing (he’s the all-time leader in assist rate), shooting efficiency (his career true shooting percentage ranks 14th) and floor-spacing. To the latter point, Stockton devoted more than 20 percent of his field-goal attempts to 3-pointers in the 1990s, a rate that (while low) wouldn’t be totally out of place for a point guard in 2019.1 And Stockton was a very good defender, garnering All-Defense honors five times and finishing seventh all-time in steal rate. Maybe Stockton is just a player whose style would stand out more in the modern NBA, but it also seems likely that he was far more valuable than observers realized during his career.
Chris Paul, point god. Similar to Stockton (and Jason Kidd slightly lower down the list), Chris Paul shows up as a legend in RAPTOR for his mix of hyper-efficient shooting and passing and his standout defense. I don’t think people realize that Paul has been named to the All-Defensive Team nine times in his career, and at the other end, he’s seldom had a season where his team didn’t average at least 1.2 points per possession on plays he personally was responsible for. We’ve often wondered why CP3-led teams can’t seem to get over the hump in the playoffs, and that is a fair criticism (although we are including playoff value in RAPTOR). Unlike with Stockton, Paul’s durability has also been an issue. But few players in history have ever been as statistically impressive.
Is Kobe … properly rated? In our JAWS list, Kobe Bryant ranks eighth … which happens to be exactly where Bill Simmons’ pyramid rankings had him! (Granted, there are a few pre-1976 players ahead of Kobe on Simmons’s list.) All-time rankings that rely on advanced metrics have usually struggled with Bryant, since his status as perhaps the league’s final star midrange gunslinger makes him one of the most polarizing statistical players ever. But RAPTOR actually kind of likes Kobe. Although his last few years were ugly and his defense was usually below-average in the back half of his career, Bryant was genuinely one of the best offensive threats of all-time, plus he gets extra credit for his playoff performance (the sixth-most postseason WAR since 1976).
Robinson > Olajuwon? This one is a classic when it comes to stat-based rankings. The specter of one series — Olajuwon’s epic 1995 Western Conference Finals performance against Robinson and the Spurs — will always hang over any mainstream debate between the two players. But advanced metrics have consistently rated Robinson higher, and RAPTOR is no different. Although RAPTOR thinks the majority of both players’ value came on defense, with Olajuwon’s D grading out slightly higher in their best seasons, Robinson gets the career advantage mainly for his skills on offense. There, RAPTOR says Robinson was routinely worth at least 2 points above average per 100 possessions, a threshold Olajuwon crossed only once in his entire career. In fact, RAPTOR considers Hakeem a below-average offensive contributor for most of the ’90s, aside from 1993 and his championship years of 1994 and ’95. But at least Olajuwon can say he had more career playoff WAR, beating The Admiral 27.1 to 19.6 in that regard.
Shaq too low? Shaquille O’Neal was one of the most dominant forces in NBA history, proving to be particularly unstoppable while winning Finals MVP with the Lakers in 2000, 2001 and 2002. So why doesn’t RAPTOR like Shaq more? Some of it comes down to durability and staying power: Shaq played fewer minutes than some of his rivals on the list (such as Tim Duncan, Karl Malone and Kevin Garnett), and he didn’t age very gracefully in the latter part of his career.2 But this could be another case of RAPTOR’s modern sensibilities derailing a ’90s-era center, particularly on offense. With a total lack of floor spacing and a somewhat modest assist rate even by big-man standards, Shaq’s career offensive RAPTOR might actually be somewhat generous at +2.5 if you compare him with contemporaries such as Patrick Ewing (-1.4), Alonzo Mourning (-1.0), Olajuwon (+0.2), Duncan (+1.5) or even Robinson (+1.9).
Who’s missing? If we compare our JAWS rankings with the top of a list like Simmons’s, some notable absences include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (111.7 JAWS, though that’s missing the first seven seasons of his career), Moses Malone (99.8), Julius Erving (113.5), Isiah Thomas (108.6) and Kevin McHale (77.8). Examples of recently retired players who just missed the top 20 were Dwyane Wade (No. 22 with a JAWS of 133.0), Ray Allen (No. 24, 129.3), Manu Ginobili (No. 26, 125.1) and Paul Pierce (No. 27, 124.2).
Now that we’ve broken down the historical RAPTOR careers, let’s dive into some great RAPTOR seasons. Here are the most valuable WAR seasons since 1976:

Uses full player-tracking RAPTOR for seasons since 2013-14, and estimated RAPTOR for earlier seasons.
Source: NBA advanced stats
There’s a whole lot of Jordan, James and Curry atop the list — in fact, no other player invades the ranking until Paul’s 2008-09 masterpiece season lands at No. 13. And in the battle for GOAT seasons, Jordan’s 1990-91 and James’s 2008-09 are separated by fewer than a half-win at the top of the heap. The players were equally good on defense per 100 possessions, and James was slightly better offensively on a rate basis, though MJ logged more minutes. RAPTOR thinks either season is basically the gold standard for individual performances over the past four-and-a-half decades.
Finally, let’s end by looking at history’s worst seasons. We already know about Sexton, Kobi Simmons and Kevin Knox, so we’ll spare them any further ignominy. On a per-possession basis, the worst RAPTOR plus/minus seasons (minimum 500 minutes) since 1976 belong to the immortal Uwe Blab (-10.6 per 100) in 1989-90, Sharone Wright (-10.0) in 1996-97 and John Amaechi (-10.0) in 2001-02. Blab played for both the Warriors and Spurs that year, averaging 2.1 points per game and producing nearly as many turnovers (35) as made baskets (39). He’s just lucky he didn’t see enough court time to be worth less than -2.2 WAR. The “leaders” in that category are Sexton (-7.4) and Knox (-6.0) from 2018-19 and Zach LaVine (-5.4) from 2014-15, but among pre-tracking data seasons, the worst WAR seasons belong to Michael Olowokandi (-5.4) in 1999-2000, Amaechi (-5.1)3 and Marcus Fizer (-4.6) in 2000-01, Bryant “Big Country” Reeves (-4.6) in 1996-97 and Adam Morrison (-4.3) in 2006-07. (Remember when Morrison was getting hyped up as the next Larry Bird? Yikes.)
As I mentioned above, you can download all of the data I looked at for this story at FiveThirtyEight’s GitHub repository for our RAPTOR metric. Please play around with it yourself, and let me know on Twitter what your favorite great — and terrible — NBA seasons were. (And why RAPTOR might be underrating Uwe Blab’s 1989-90 campaign.) One of the great things about RAPTOR is that it’s based on publicly available data, and we want to keep that spirit alive by releasing the results for others to use for research. And who knows? Maybe the upcoming 2019-20 season will provide new entries for the all-time best and worst RAPTOR seasons — and help some of the GOATs above solidify their places on the all-time list.

$3 billion in lost earnings
American carmaker General Motors Co. says a 40-day strike at dozens of domestic factories will cost the company close to $3 billion in lost earnings. The Detroit auto manufacturer easily surpassed analysts’ forecasts for its third-quarter results, but the road ahead will be bumpy with executives saying they expect the U.S. market to contract next year, and further volatility in China and South America. The strike resulted in a new deal between GM and the United Auto Workers union that increased wages and bonuses but also the closure of three U.S. manufacturing plants. [Wall Street Journal]
14 highest peaks in 189 days
I often feel bad about how I don’t exercise enough, but Nirmal Purja’s ambition was clearly a little bit higher. He smashed the record for climbing the world’s 14 highest peaks in 189 days, or a little over six months. The Nepalese former British army soldier’s speedy itinerary included climbing Everest, Lhotse and Makalu back-to-back in only 48 hours and summiting Shishapangma, his last climb, at 8:58 a.m. local time on Tuesday. South Korean climber Kim Chang-ho held the previous record of seven years, 11 months, and 14 days. [The Guardian]
23 Republican seats
One of the reasons why Republican senators haven’t broken with President Trump is because there are 23 seats held by members of the GOP that are up for re-election next year, and 5 of those races have been rated by election forecasters as the most competitive Senate contests in 2020. FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley explains these senators are in a double-bind if Trump’s standing declines, because “they’re also in a position where they can’t afford to alienate their party’s base.” [FiveThirtyEight]
0 refugees in October
CNN reports that the United States is on track to admit zero refugees for the month of October after cancelling approximately 500 flights. A state department spokesperson confirmed a pause of admissions will now extend until November 5, the third delay this month. The United Nations’s refugee agency estimated there were more than 20 million refugees last year, with more than 12,000 Syrian refugees fleeing in recent months, as the humanitarian crisis there worsens. [CNN]
3 times as many fatal car accidents involving kids
You might still be scrambling to think of a Halloween costume, but one of the scariest things about the last day of October is the annual spike in fatal car accidents involving kids. The Washington Post analyzed federal highway safety data and found children are three times more likely to be struck and killed while trick or treating that night than any other day of the year. The numbers are relatively low compared to the millions of costumed kids who go out, but data shows roads are becoming more dangerous over time after a record-number of pedestrians and cyclists were killed by cars last year. [Washington Post]
74,000-square-foot grocery store
Food is a really important part of everyone’s life, but few places inspire the level of fandom and loyalty on display at 7 a.m. on Sunday in Brooklyn, when a new 74,000-square-foot branch of the incredibly popular Wegmans grocery store chain opened in the Navy Yard. Hundreds of people lined up to shop at the family-owned business, with some “Wegmaniacs” traveling six hours for the opportunity to browse the brand-new aisles. Lynn Schmidt, who grew up in Syracuse, told the New York Times she had been waiting for a Wegmans in New York City for decades. [New York Times]

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): On Thursday, the House will hold its first formal vote of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, signaling a new chapter in the impeachment investigation and perhaps an expedited timeline, with a full vote possible by Christmas.
So, let’s take a step back and start with the basics: Why are Democrats moving to hold a floor vote now after weeks of resisting one, especially considering the courts just ruled in their favor, saying the investigation was legal?
ameliatd (Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, senior writer): I’m not sure how much of a legal benefit Democrats get from that court ruling, as the Trump administration’s arguments that the investigation is invalid were already on shaky ground. So I think one of the main functions of the vote is to outline what the rules for the public hearings will be, as well as possibly kneecapping Republicans who have been trying to condemn the inquiry because of a lack of a formal vote.
clare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): I think there’s a real desire among Democrats to make this public sooner rather than later, too. There’s some sense that it’s been good practice to keep these initial hearings behind closed doors so witnesses don’t coordinate statements or what have you. But it can’t be behind closed doors forever! And I’m sure there’s a sense that the Democrats don’t want to give Republicans any more fuel for the fire of “secret, scary, due-process denying hearings!”
perry (Perry Bacon Jr., senior writer): I also assume Democrats are now comfortable taking a vote because the closed-door hearings have revealed a ton of questionable behavior by Trump and his administration. The vote to formally start the impeachment process will likely be interpreted by the public as a vote to impeach Trump. But I think the members, even in more moderate districts, now feel more comfortable taking that vote. An impeachment inquiry is no longer unpopular.

clare.malone: Impeachment is pretty popular! Though I find it interesting that there isn’t as much support for impeaching Trump and removing him from office.

ameliatd: It is also noteworthy that Democrats are willing to move on from closed-door hearings at this point. One of the big differences between this impeachment inquiry and the Nixon/Clinton impeachment proceedings is that the others were based on a preexisting criminal investigation where a special prosecutor had already done a lot of legwork to figure out exactly what happened. The Democrats have been doing their own investigation from scratch over the past few weeks. And that’s hard to do quickly!
sarahf: Another key distinction, though, is just how one-sided the support for impeachment proceedings are. It seems as if no Republicans will cross the aisle and vote in favor of this, right?
ameliatd: You’re right that other impeachment proceedings weren’t so one-sided at this point in the process. The vote to open an impeachment inquiry was overwhelmingly bipartisan in Nixon’s case (but Republicans didn’t really see that as an endorsement of impeachment and it took them a long time to fully abandon him), and quasi-bipartisan in Clinton’s case (about 30 Democrats crossed the aisle). But remember, in Clinton’s case, even that level of bipartisan support vanished pretty quickly.
So I think what this vote is really signaling is Democrats saying: 1) We’ve got what we need. 2) We’re ready to go public. 3) Here’s what the rules will be.
perry: Yeah, Democrats certainly seem to have what they need: evidence of impeachable offenses, pretty good polling and buy-in from the moderate members.
clare.malone: The idea of “we have what we need” is really key, given that in my view, a successful impeachment for Democrats is really about selling the public on their side of the story: the idea that Trump robustly abused power.
They’ll especially need that in a presidential election year, which makes everything very sensitive to begin with.
sarahf: On the question of moderate support, though, this stood out to me in some reporting from Politico:
Shortly after the vote on the resolution was announced Monday, several senior Democratic aides were struggling to explain the rationale, having been given little notice of it themselves and expressing concern about the long-term political impact it could have on the caucus’ most vulnerable members.
Some moderate Democrats are already anxious about the plan, after making clear to leadership that they wanted to avoid any unnecessary floor votes on impeachment.
Do we think any Democrats break ranks in this vote? Isn’t the idea that this will be interpreted as a vote to impeach Trump by the public, as Perry said earlier, a real risk here for Democrats?
ameliatd: Well, it’s certainly possible. The last time the New York Times updated their whip count of who supports opening an impeachment inquiry against Trump, there were eight Democratic holdouts. That’s not a lot of Democrats who might remain opposed, but it’s also not a full consensus.
perry: I suspect all but a handful of Democrats will vote to authorize the investigation, and all but a handful will vote to impeach Trump. Maybe a few Democrats vote to investigate but not impeach, but even in a swing district, the overwhelming majority of Democratic voters are likely pro-impeachment. That makes it hard, I think, for a Democratic member to vote no on either the investigation or impeachment.
ameliatd: I’m also not sure how much this vote will matter vs. the ultimate impeachment vote. Maybe there’s a risk that if the Democrats really whiff on the public hearings, it will backfire on moderates, but I don’t know how much movement we’ll see between this vote and the vote to impeach, whenever that happens.
perry: Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota is in a very pro-Trump area, so maybe he votes against it.
Or Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. She is unpredictable and was an impeachment hold-out for a while.
ameliatd: But how much is at stake if only a handful of Democrats vote against opening the inquiry? I guess I think the bigger test will be the public hearings and how convincingly Democrats can marshal the evidence they’ve gathered.
perry: I agree. It doesn’t really matter.
clare.malone: Yeah, there’s not a lot of risk in this week’s vote, especially given Tuesday’s testimony from the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council who was privy to Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president in July. There’s certainly some hang-your-political-cojones out there in the long-term if you’re a moderate Democrat, though.
But I think how Trump reacts to public hearings could give moderate Democrats cover in the weeks or months to come, similar to how once the Mueller investigation began to focus on Trump’s attempts to obstruct the investigation, he reacted poorly. I could easily imagine something similar happening here.
ameliatd: The Democrats are definitely trying to weaponize Trump’s reaction, and it’ll be telling to see how the public responds to that. Adam Schiff has essentially said that they’re not going to try to force testimony from White House officials who have refused to cooperate so far. Instead, they’ll just use that as evidence for obstruction of justice charges.
As I wrote on Tuesday, it’s definitely a pragmatic strategy for Democrats, as they just don’t have time to fight this in the courts. But it’s also potentially a little risky given that the obstruction of justice claims in the Mueller report didn’t lead to higher support for impeachment. Maybe it’ll be different this time?
perry: I actually don’t think the hearings matter? The evidence we have now is fairly extensive, and partisanship is very high. Are we suggesting the public hearings will make impeachment go up to 60 percent popularity or down to 40? How?
What Democratic voters are going to be break against impeachment? What Republican voters could be moved by the hearings (or anything else) to be for it?
clare.malone: I don’t think the hearings are going to make Republicans want it, Perry. But the hearings could bum Republicans enough to make them unenthusiastic. And depending on who the Democratic nominee is, maybe Republicans stay home, or perhaps they aren’t outraged enough by the nominee to vote against them and for Trump.
I think the hearings could be impactful in that way. They are, after all, going to create weeks of (likely) very unflattering news for the president. Is that nothing?
ameliatd: It’s also possible the hearings aren’t as dramatic or compelling as we’ve been led to believe, and so maybe some people who are in favor of impeachment conclude it’s actually not worth removing a president with less than a year to go until the election.
clare.malone: I’m not sure it necessarily has to be about dramatic moments in hearing rooms for it to have an impact, though.
I do think there’s a contingent of Republican and Republican-leaning independents who could be turned off by the whole thing. Again, who the Democratic nominee is has a lot to do with how that contingent acts. But it doesn’t need to be all drama, drama, drama to make waves electorally.
sarahf: So how does the Democratic nominee factor into all of this? It’s definitely one incentive for Democrats to move quickly, right? But how does the Democratic primary impact Republicans?
clare.malone: If Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, you’ve got a pretty motivated Republican electorate, and maybe the hearings matter less?
If it’s Biden, though, you’ve theoretically got a contingent of Republicans that are less concerned with coming out against the Democrats, and they might be more OK with staying home?
perry: I guess the one thing that I don’t quite understand is if the impeachment hearings are in December/January, that would certainly affect the Democratic nomination process, although I’m not sure how.
At the very least, the senators running would need to be in Washington, D.C. instead of Iowa.
clare.malone: Yeah, it’s poor timing!
ameliatd: It does seem increasingly likely that the impeachment trial will be in January, which is bad for the senators running. But it’s better to have the trial in January than have it stretch into February/March and suck up even more oxygen from other issues. And of course, the later it goes, the more it fuels the argument that an election is coming and the voters should decide.
clare.malone: It also risks making the race about Trump’s impeachment, which hasn’t necessarily been what voters in those early states want to hear about ALL the time.
Sanders made that point at the last debate, arguing that the candidates were getting sucked into the vortex of impeachment when they should be focusing more on the systemic issues facing Americans. I think that’s a valid, strategic view.
ameliatd: This is a hard issue for the Democratic candidates to weigh in on, too. There’s not a lot of daylight between them in terms of their stances on impeachment (as we saw in the debate), and it doesn’t really have much to do with their specific pitch for being president. So I’m sure they don’t want impeachment hanging over the primaries and, as Clare said, distracting from the other things they want to focus on.
sarahf: So does this move to formalize the vote change the nature of the impeachment investigation at all? I’m struggling with understanding the Democrats’ end goal. Is it to wrap this by the end of the year, hopefully by having moved public opinion enough that some Republicans break ranks?
Or if no Republicans break, is the goal to have released enough publicly damaging information about the president that it casts real doubts in voters’ eyes about his reelection prospects?
clare.malone: I think, honestly, in this age of hardcore partisanship, it’s more of the latter. It’s about an accumulation of bad information about him. It’s about depressing the vote on their side of things, not necessarily about persuasion.
And honestly, on some level, it’s about keeping their base happy.
ameliatd: I feel like we keep having these moments that seem like big news, but the day-to-day is functionally unchanged. The Democrats were always going to have public hearings, and it was going to be soon. This is a confirmation that they’re trying to move quickly, but it’s not a change in strategy.
clare.malone: Welcome to the NOTHING REALLY MATTERS team, Amelia!
ameliatd: Do we have hats? I would wear that hat.
clare.malone: MAKE AMERICA NIHILIST AGAIN.
ameliatd: But in terms of shifting support (maybe I am about to lose my NOTHING REALLY MATTERS hat), I think the hearings — and the narrative that emerges around them — will have more practical significance than the vote. Maybe not because it will be all-drama-all-the-time (we can only expect so much of congressional hearings), but because this is the Democrats’ window to strategically release into the open all of the damning evidence that they’ve gathered.
perry: These two votes will be among the most important these members take.
clare.malone: Their Iraq War Vote equivalent.
perry: Also, the skeptical Trump/Trump disapproval voters do matter, as Clare was getting at. If voting for Trump becomes something 15 percent of registered Republicans feel they can’t do, that’s a big thing.
If the evidence is so bad that Sens. Mitt Romney, Cory Gardner and Susan Collins vote to convict, that’s significant too.
clare.malone: Yeah, as we talked about on the podcast yesterday, some of these vulnerable GOP senators are in a real pickle.
sarahf: We’re probably still far way away from seeing any real break in the dam, especially if the House Republicans are unified in voting against the floor vote.
I do think, though, that one big risk in all of this for Democrats is if public opinion doesn’t move, or if support for impeaching and removing Trump from office drops after the public hearings start. That will complicate the narrative for Democrats.
ameliatd: True, none of this is to say that there’s no downside for the Democrats proceeding this way, especially if you look at a historical example like the Clinton saga, where support for impeachment did tick down as the inquiry wore on. But support for impeaching Clinton was also never consistently as high as it is currently for Trump. And if you buy the argument that some have made, that impeachment ultimately hurt Clinton and his party more than it hurt the Republicans, today’s Democrats are arguably in a pretty good position.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

The Hot Takedown crew completes its first ever Super Bowl draft — complete with a lot of smack talk and hot takes of our own.
The Astros have the potential to clinch their second World Series title in three years tonight at home against the Nationals. In the midst of their title run, the scandal involving their assistant GM’s aggressive behavior toward reporters and the subsequent attempt by the Astros to cover up the incident has certainly complicated the event. Our team assesses the story and the fallout, and we talk about how to grapple with these complex issues as a fan.
Finally, our Rabbit Hole features another infamous Rabbit.

CORRECTION (Oct. 30, 2019, 6 p.m.): A previous version of this post incorrectly named the Los Angeles Dodgers as Houston’s opponent in the World Series.

And they did. We received many, many, many climate change questions. So many, in fact, that we’re doing several different projects around them. You’ve already seen the first of our columns on Who’s Winning Climate Change? Today, we’ll dive into the mailbag for the first Climate Question from an Adult – a series that will explore the business, culture and chemistry behind your most pressing questions about global warming. Have a question? Send it to us!
Q: One of the few things that has given me hope about our ability to avoid climate disaster is reading about companies that are capturing carbon from the air and finding ways to monetize it. Are there limitations to our ability to do this? Is there a reason why this couldn’t become a rapidly expanding industry in the next decade or so? — Andrew Janet, Maryland
There are worse reasons to invest in a nascent industry than that a Nobel prize-winning body heavily implied it would be a good idea. Since at least 2005, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been drawing attention to the benefits of “carbon capture and storage,” the technologies that allow us to suck carbon dioxide from the air and trap it where it can’t do any harm. Just last year, a special IPCC report on keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius found that some kind of carbon capture technology would be essentially required to maintain any hope of hitting that goal.
That should be good news for CCS as a commercial industry. But despite that, and despite the way several other climate and energy-related industries have grown over the last decade, carbon capture and storage is still more of a gamble than a clear success story.
The problem lies in a behavioral economics problem that differentiates this industry from solar power, electric cars and other profitable tech sectors, said Gregory Nemet, professor of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Namely: There’s not really any reason to pay for CCS other than combating climate change. Turns out that saving the world, on its own, isn’t necessarily a good enough reason to save the world.
Carbon capture and storage works, essentially, because chemistry is nifty. There are many different ways to pull carbon dioxide out of the air or a column of factory smoke, but all methods are based on the principle that CO2 sticks to certain chemicals. So, for example, a coal-fired power plant in Saskatchewan, Canada, uses a system that you can kind of imagine as a giant bong. The plant takes the mixture of water vapor and gas left over after coal is burned and bubbles it up through a liquid that contains several chemicals related to ammonia. The CO2 clings to the liquid solution and the rest of the gases keep on rising up and out of the power plant smokestack. Heating the solution frees the CO2 molecules, which are then trapped and compressed in tanks. The liquid can be reused.
This process takes a lot of equipment. It takes energy to heat the liquid and compress the CO2, and that means the power plant has to burn more coal and produce more power than it did before. But while those facts mean carbon capture isn’t cheap, it’s also a pretty well-understood technology. The scrubbing process used at that Canadian power plant is cutting edge, in terms of reducing CO2 emissions, but it’s old tech. The fossil fuel industry has been using the same process since the 1930s to improve the quality of natural gas. The main difference between the older process and the modern application is that the captured CO2 t is meant to be squirreled away indefinitely, where it can’t ever reach the atmosphere.
Today, there are 19 large-scale commercial carbon capture and sequestration facilities1 operating around the world, 10 of which are in the United States, according to the Global CCS Institute. All of them are pulling carbon dioxide out of the emissions from an associated factory or power plant. Systems that pull CO2 out of the ambient air, like the ones Andrew referenced in his question, do exist. They’re just harder and more expensive to operate because the concentration of CO2 in the air is so much lower, Nemet said. “At a power plant, 10 to 20 percent of what goes up the smokestack is CO2, compared to .04 percent in the air,” he said.
So generally speaking, the technology of carbon capture is ready to go. The problem with CCS is that it doesn’t really have a destination, said Dan Lashof, U.S. director of the nonprofit World Resources Institute.
Other climate-adjacent industries, such as electric vehicles and solar photovoltaics, have grown rapidly in the past decade. But Lashof pointed out the other industries offer benefits outside of their climate impact. “Solar is generating electricity you can sell. Electric cars are really fun and fast and you don’t have to go to the gas station. There’s a market for that independent of climate benefits,” he said.
In a world where trapped carbon emissions are essentially worthless, there’s not much reason for companies to invest in a technology that does nothing but reduce carbon emissions, experts told me. Wind, solar and electric cars were all able to start small and build on niche demand. But CCS hasn’t really been able to do either of those things, said Howard Herzog, senior research engineer at the MIT Energy Initiative.
This in part explains why CCS boosters have so much enthusiasm for the idea of finding ways to monetize captured CO2. It’s not just about winning at business. Barring the miraculous passage of a carbon tax, it might also be about the only way to get crucial climate tech off the ground.
There have been some successes. In Switzerland, for example, a company called Climeworks is sucking CO2 directly out of the air and selling it to soda companies and agricultural interests. “They pump it into greenhouses to increase the yield on tomatoes,” Nemet said. But even those applications have to compete with naturally occurring CO2 extracted from the ground. In other cases, companies can just buy CO2 as a cheap byproduct from chemical manufacturing, he told me.
Awkwardly, the most successful market for captured CO2 has been … extracting more fossil fuels, experts told me. Oil and gas companies buy CO2 extracted from the emissions of coal-fired power plants and pump it into depleted wells to help loosen more trapped hydrocarbons. It makes sense as a way to store CO2 — if you know the geology could reliably hold the oil and gas, then you know it can hold the CO2 as well. But the practice “comes with some baggage,” as Nemet put it. Enabling the further burning of fossil fuels probably isn’t what people like Andrew had in mind when they look at CCS as a reason for hope.
There are some policies that will likely help CCS solve its market problems. In 2018, Congress passed a tax credit that rewards companies for each metric ton of carbon dioxide they lock away. That, combined with new California laws that also reward companies for carbon sequestration, might make CCS truly profitable for the first time, said Geoff Holmes, head of business development at Carbon Engineering, a Canadian carbon management company.
Again, he’s talking about CO2 used to pump more oil and gas out of the ground. But if these policies help a few additional CCS projects succeed, Holmes and Lashof think that could convince politicians to pass more laws that make sequestering CO2 valuable. And hopefully all of that would happen fast enough to get the direct-air capture industry off the ground in time to save the world. It’s kind of a high-stakes game of chicken-or-egg, played in the middle of the interstate.
This has all gone in a bit of a “let’s undermine Andrew Janet’s faith in humanity” direction, and I apologize for that. But there is some reason to maintain hope, even if CCS never makes it to the other side of the road.
If you’re willing to accept that we won’t keep global warming under 1.5 degrees, it might not matter much whether CCS becomes a winner or not, Nemet said. That’s because so many other emissions-reducing technologies are winning. If you lump them all together, he said, the combination of solar, wind, electric vehicles, advanced batteries, liquid biofuels and other technologies could make enough of a dent that it doesn’t matter whether CCS ever becomes cheap. “It’s a really good thing we have these other possibilities that are emerging,” he said. “Potentially it eats away at the case for the necessity of CCS.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

They have ties to Harvard University and are known for giving thoughtful, sometimes wonky answers to questions. They hail from the middle of the country, which they play up on the stump. They’re a trendy choice among cosmopolitan elites, but they face a real challenge in diversifying their coalition.
It’s a trick question, of course: That description can apply to either South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg or Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Given everything the two have in common, it seems like they would be competing for the same “lane” of Democratic voters — which implies only one can emerge as the winner of what I’ll call the “ivory-tower primary.”
Except their supporters aren’t exactly alike. At least, not anymore. And that’s because highly educated white Democrats — like every demographic — aren’t a uniform voting bloc.
I dove into the crosstabs of some recent polls to see how much Buttigieg and Warren are truly relying on the same type of voter. And their supporters do have some obvious similarities. For example, the candidates’ bases are predominantly white — and they especially struggle among black voters. Check out their support by race in recent1 national polls of the Democratic primary:

Data set is the nine polls that include crosstabs for white and black voters among the 10 most recent national polls of the Democratic primary, as of Oct. 28, 2019.
Source: Polls
On average, Buttigieg pulls 6 percent of the vote overall in those polls, but 8 percent of the white vote. And Warren garners 20 percent of the vote overall, but 24 percent of the white vote. By contrast, every poll agrees that black voters are less likely to support Buttigieg and Warren than Democrats do overall. The signal is fuzzier among Hispanic voters (the occasional poll does show Buttigieg and Warren doing particularly well there), but on average, the two Democrats are also less popular with this demographic than the party overall.
The polls also indicate that both Buttigieg’s and Warren’s bases are disproportionately college-educated. While we don’t have a table for you here,2 most of the polls analyzed above agree that Buttigieg’s and Warren’s numbers get better as you go higher up the ladder of educational attainment. For example, in the CNN/SSRS poll, Warren registered at 25 percent support among college graduates vs. 14 percent among non-college graduates, while Buttigieg registered at 7 percent among college graduates vs. 4 percent among non-college graduates.
But there is at least one important distinction between Buttigieg’s and Warren’s supporters. While both candidates have predominantly white, college-educated bases, Warren’s is more clearly liberal, while Buttigieg’s is more ideologically diverse.

Data set is the five polls that include crosstabs for very liberal, somewhat liberal and moderate voters among the 10 most recent national polls of the Democratic primary, as of Oct. 28, 2019.
Source: Polls
It’s clear from the polls that liberal Democrats — and specifically very liberal Democrats — are Warren’s bread and butter. Although she averages 20 percent overall support in the polls in the table, she averages 24 percent among somewhat liberal respondents and 28 percent among very liberal ones. But Buttigieg doesn’t seem to have an obvious ideological base. For example, the latest Quinnipiac poll says Buttigieg’s support is about equally strong among moderate/conservative voters and somewhat liberal voters, but notably lower with very liberal voters. But CNN/SSRS finds higher Buttigieg support among liberal respondents than moderate and conservative ones.3
Notably, back in April, when Buttigieg raised his profile and enjoyed a modest polling bump, the ideology of Buttigieg supporters was less ambiguous: He was appealing primarily to liberal Democrats. Per a Monmouth poll at the time, he was at 12 percent among liberal respondents but only 5 percent among moderate or conservative ones. In CNN/SSRS’s April poll, he was at 11 percent among liberals and just 4 percent among moderates.
In other words, Buttigieg’s base in April looked more like Warren’s does today. What caused them to diverge? One theory is that Buttigieg himself has tacked toward the center. On the campaign trail, he has deemphasized his plans to overhaul government institutions and attacked Warren for being evasive on how she will pay for her “Medicare for All” proposal. Instead, his campaign is promising “a plan that works for all of us,” which may very well be resonating with the more consensus-oriented wing of the party — and alienating true believers on the left.
But it could also be that Buttigieg’s rhetorical pivot was dictated by a new political reality for him — that Warren, who has risen steadily in the polls since April, is now dominant among the white, liberal, college-educated voters who gave Buttigieg his first surge. If so, Buttigieg’s message may be changing in response to the polls — not the other way around.
Regardless of whether the chicken or the egg came first, daylight opening up between the Buttigieg and Warren bases has some important implications. First, if they are no longer competing for the exact same pool of voters, it’s possible that the primary could come down to Buttigieg and Warren (and probably a third candidate whose base is nonwhite voters, if Buttigieg and Warren don’t improve on that score).
Second, if Buttigieg’s base continues to shift toward the middle, he may end up grateful to be in the moderate “lane”; according to the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, half (51 percent) of Democratic primary voters are actually moderate or conservative, not progressive.
And finally, more broadly, the subtle shift in Buttigieg’s supporters since April suggests that candidate coalitions can be malleable. Just because a candidate’s base is a certain type of voter today doesn’t mean he’s stuck with that wing of the party for the rest of the race. Political analysts — hi! — would do well to remember that.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-early-but-there-have-been-a-lot-of-nba-foul-outs/,2019-10-30,,,features,"Oct. 30, 2019",It’s Early … But There Have Been A Lot Of NBA Foul Outs,Jared Dubin,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"In the first Thursday night TNT game of the 2019-20 NBA season, the Milwaukee Bucks picked up a road victory over the Houston Rockets, outscoring the home team 39-24 in the fourth quarter and 26-16 over the final seven-plus minutes of the game. That the Bucks pulled out a close win down the stretch was not unusual in and of itself: On their way to 60 regular-season wins last year, the Bucks were one of the best clutch-time teams in the NBA, going 22-14 in games that were within 5 points at any time in the last five minutes, according to NBA.com. What is unusual about this particular win was that all of clutch time was played without the services of reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who fouled out with 5:18 remaining in the game.
The Bucks’ second game of the season also entered clutch time, with their contest against the Miami Heat going to overtime after Antetokounmpo tied the game at the buzzer by tipping a Khris Middleton airball into the hoop. Two minutes and 29 seconds into overtime, though, Antetokounmpo fouled out again. And he wasn’t the only one. Three other players1 fouled out of that game as well.
Foul outs are generally pretty rare, and games with multiple players fouling out are even more so. But that Bucks-Heat matchup was not even the first game this season in which multiple players were disqualified because of fouls, and it almost certainly won’t be the last.2 Foul outs have absolutely skyrocketed early this season.
Through the 51 games played as of Monday night, there had been 21 foul outs. Given that there are 1,230 games played in an NBA season, this puts us on a full-season pace of 506 foul outs this season. How does that compare to previous seasons?3

If this full-season pace holds, the 2019-20 season would see a 60 percent increase in foul outs over the number of foul outs last season, which itself was over a 40 percent increase in foul outs from the year before. The league has not seen even 400 foul outs since the 2006-07 campaign — and prior to last year had not seen 300-plus foul outs since the 2010-11 season.
Some of this year’s incredible foul-out pace is obviously due to a small sample size. There aren’t many games in which four players foul out, and in a sample of just 51 games, having just one will affect the full-season pace quite a bit. But even if you remove that game, the league would still be on pace for 418 foul outs this season, an increase of nearly 32 percent from a year ago.4
What’s behind this early-season phenomenon? There appear to be a few contributing factors. The first is an overall spike in foul calls. Last season, the league averaged 41.6 total foul calls per game, according to data from PBP Stats. This year, that number has shot up to 48.1 per game. Much of that spike can be explained by an increase in the rate of offensive foul calls.
The league identified “Illegal Contact Initiated by Offensive Players” as its first officiating point of education for the 2019-20 season. “The officiating staff will maintain heightened focus on these types of plays moving forward this season,” said Monty McCutchen, Vice President of referee development and training, in a video offering guidance about these types of fouls. But there’s emphasizing a point of education, and then there’s what’s happening this season.
From the 2003-04 to 2018-19 seasons, offensive fouls accounted for 8.8 percent of total fouls. The NBA has broken out offensive fouls by type (i.e., charge vs. non-charge) going back to the 2010-11 season, and in that time, charge calls have ranged between 0.96 and 1.40 per game, and non-charge offensive fouls, such as illegal screens, checked in between 2.05 and 2.68 per game. Overall, offensive fouls per game peaked in 2006-07, at 4.39 per game. That is, until this season.

So far in the 2019-20 campaign, referees are whistling 6.39 offensive fouls per game, nearly 75 percent more than the 3.66 they called a year ago. Charges have spiked from 1.11 per game last season to 1.84 this year. Illegal screens and other offensive fouls have jumped as well, shooting up from 2.55 per game to 4.55 per game. Offensive fouls account for 13.4 percent of all foul calls so far this season and have contributed to 12 of the 21 foul outs leaguewide.
But if offensive fouls are up so dramatically over a year ago, why did the foul-out spike begin last season? And how does that relate to what looks like a second spike this year? The increase in offensive fouls doesn’t seem to be the culprit for the overall movement — the 3.66 offensive foul calls per game last season were just 0.39 more than the year before and lie firmly in the middle of the average number of total offensive foul calls over the previous 15 years. It also doesn’t seem to be due to an increase in pace,5 an increase in overtime games,6 an increase in clutch-time games7 or even an increase in the share of clutch-time games that entered overtime.8
Instead, we may be able to blame a specific group of players: the youngest in the league. Players between 18 and 22 years old are being given more responsibility and a greater share of minutes than ever in our time frame. From 2004 to 2018, these players accounted for between 13.1 percent and 17.9 percent of all leaguewide minutes played. During the 2018-19 season, that number spiked to 20 percent.9
A typical player in that youngest age range averaged 4.4 fouls per 48 minutes, nearly 10 percent greater than a player aged 23 and older, and that’s in line with figures from prior seasons. The 18- to 22-year-olds accounted for 75 of the 317 foul outs the league saw last season, the greatest number of foul outs that group of players had had since the 2008-09 campaign. Perhaps not coincidentally, foul outs began dropping off after that season.
It’s worth noting that the youngins have accounted for five of the 21 foul outs so far this season, which puts them on pace for 121 on the year — or nearly as many as the past two seasons combined. With teams increasingly asking younger players to handle larger and larger minute burdens, and with the league once again looking to crack down on certain types of foul calls, it’s entirely possible we could be in for a season full of players exiting the game early.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-is-the-year-of-the-massive-nfl-betting-line/,2019-10-30,,,features,"Oct. 30, 2019",This Is The Year Of The Massive NFL Betting Line,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"When the Minnesota Vikings closed as 16½-point favorites over Washington last Thursday, it was the eighth time this season that one NFL team was favored by more than two touchdowns over another in the Vegas line, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com’s data.
Is that a lot? Well, yes.
The 2019 regular season isn’t even halfway over (Week 9 of 17 is this week), and this is already the fifth-most games in a season since 1978 with a team favored by more than two TDs.1 The record number, 15, was set in 1992, and that season also saw eight such games occur through Week 8. So no matter how you look at it, we’re on pace this year to break — or at the very least rival — the record for most lopsided games in a season.
Two touchdowns is kind of an arbitrary threshold, of course. But that is also the number at which oddsmakers usually tend to pump the brakes when they’re setting a point spread. “In the past, 14 [points] was kind of the golden number in the NFL,” said Ed Salmons, who is vice president of risk management and oddsmaking for the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas. “It’s hard to give a professional team more than 14 points in a game.”
Without a doubt, though, that has changed this season.
Some of it might have to do with the quality of talent at the top of the league. Two teams — the New England Patriots and the San Francisco 49ers — are undefeated, with both posting historic point differentials through eight weeks. Overall, six clubs (New England, San Francisco, New Orleans, Green Bay, Minnesota and Kansas City) have an Elo rating of at least 1615 at full strength, which is roughly the marker of a championship-caliber team according to our favorite measure of team strength.2 With such a strong crop of contenders, they are naturally going to be involved in more lopsided contests as the season plays out.
However, the bigger culprits are probably found at the bottom of the league. Salmons told me that the sheer ineptitude of the league’s worst teams — some of which is suspected to be on purpose — has caused oddsmakers to reconsider their old rule of thumb about issuing lines larger than two touchdowns.
“Now you kind of self-handicap, and say to yourself, ‘Would you bet this team if they were getting 14½ [points]?’ And you’re like, no way,” Salmons said. “So then you just kind of dare yourself to go higher and higher.”
According to Salmons, the turning point for oddsmakers has been this year’s woeful 0-7 Miami Dolphins squad. The team spent all offseason deflecting speculation that it was tanking, but a 59-10 thrashing by the Baltimore Ravens in the opening week did nothing to dispel the suggestion. From there, Miami’s underdog lines were off to the races: The team was getting 18 points against New England in Week 2, 22 against Dallas in Week 3 — the sixth-largest line in PFR’s database — 15 against the Chargers in Week 4, 17 against the Bills in Week 7 and 14 against the Steelers on Monday night.
Of the eight games with a spread over 14 points this season, half involved the Dolphins.3 The only time Miami’s opponent was favored by fewer than double digits was in the so-called Tank Bowl against an equally atrocious Washington team. (And even then, the line was Washington -6.)
“I think the thing that really led to this [trend] was that New England-Miami game,” Salmons said. “I think we put up 16½ or 17 originally, and it just kept climbing and climbing. There was no professional [bettor] who wanted any part of Miami in that game. I think that game kind of gave the oddsmakers a lot more confidence.”
In general, confidence is a big factor in the trend toward larger lines — particularly when it comes to factoring in team-building strategies (like tanking) and key absences.
“The oddsmakers have gotten a lot smarter about knowing how much a quarterback is worth,” Salmons said, pointing to the Chiefs-Packers game — which the SuperBook set at Chiefs -4 12 days before the game but flipped to Packers -3 (and eventually closed at Packers -5) after Patrick Mahomes was injured. “They’re better at knowing how much the drop-off is from this quarterback to that quarterback.”
So with a proliferation of bad teams and QB injuries, the 2019 season has created the perfect environment for huge point spreads. It’s also helped that, early on at least, the big favorites were covering those margins. Of the first six games with the line exceeding two TDs this season, the favorite covered five times. But in the most recent two — including Minnesota, which was 7 yards away from going up 17 on Washington before being stopped on fourth down with 32 seconds left — it didn’t. And bookmakers might be starting to sense that they’ve pushed the lines as far as they’ll go anyway.
“You’re more bold with [these lines], but there’s a point where the professionals see value in them,” Salmons said. “That’s when you try to back away from it some. It’s definitely a cat-and-mouse game, trying to go high.”
Still, as long as the NFL rewards the worst teams with the highest draft picks — and teams build bad rosters accordingly — we could be looking at the potential for historic mismatches in the Vegas line over the weeks and years to come.
Looking Ahead: Week 9
Best matchup:4 No. 4 Minnesota (-0.5) at No. 12 Kansas City, 1 p.m. ET Sunday
Although Ravens-Patriots is the highest-quality game of the week based on Elo alone, both of those teams are all but assured of playoff spots already, which reduces the stakes a bit. The game that best mixes playoff importance, team quality and matchup closeness, then, sees the Vikings and Chiefs square off at Arrowhead Stadium. With Mahomes almost certainly sidelined for another week, K.C. will once again turn to backup QB Matt Moore after he played surprisingly well in a close loss to Green Bay on Sunday night. The Chiefs rely heavily on Mahomes, and Elo downgrades them to an average team without him, but Andy Reid also has enough coaching tricks up his sleeve to keep Kansas City competitive until the reigning league MVP returns to action. As for the Vikings, they rank fourth in Elo and seventh in our Super Bowl odds, with Kirk Cousins playing quite well over his past four games. Because the Packers have started the season strong, Minnesota has only a 25 percent chance to win the NFC North, but that number would go up to 34 percent with a win here, and the Vikings’ playoff chances would rise to 84 percent as well. Because the higher-rated team (Minnesota) is on the road, however, Elo thinks it’s only a slim 53 percent favorite, making this the biggest toss-up of Week 9.

Game Quality is based on the Elo Ratings of both teams. Evenness is based on how close the game is to 50-50 pregame odds. A game’s importance is based on how much it swings the playoff odds of the teams involved. A game’s Quarterbacks are judged on the QB Elo ratings of the two starters.
Biggest playoff implications: No. 8 Houston (-4.5) vs. No. 21 Jacksonville, 9:30 a.m. ET Sunday, at Wembley Stadium (London)
Potential shift in playoff odds: 30.2 total percentage points
It seems like we highlight an AFC South matchup in this space every week, but maybe that’s what you get in a division where every team is .500 or better. This time, it’s the Texans and Jaguars from London, in one of those early-morning NFL specials stateside. Deshaun Watson and Houston scored an important bounceback win over Oakland last week to keep pace with the surprising Colts at the top of the division. The Texans’ division odds would rise from 39 percent to 50 percent with another victory, and they’d have an 82 percent chance of making the playoffs as well. But a loss would knock those odds down to 17 and 48 percent, respectively, so there’s a lot on the line here. Meanwhile, Gardner Minshew’s Jags stopped a two-game slide with back-to-back wins of their own, keeping their playoff odds at 30 percent. That number could rise to 52 percent with an upset of Houston but would drop to 18 percent with a loss. As far as midseason AFC South games from London go, this one is huge. And as an added bonus, this is the sixth-best International Series game in the U.K. ever, based on the combined Elo of both teams. Yay!
Best QB duels: No. 2 Aaron Rodgers (GB) vs. No. 12 Philip Rivers (LAC); No. 8 Tom Brady (NE) vs. No. 10 Lamar Jackson (BAL); No. 9 Kirk Cousins (MIN) vs. NR Matt Moore* (KC)
* Moore is replacing No. 1 Patrick Mahomes, who reportedly has an “outside chance” to play but is most likely out for Week 9. Moore would rank 23rd among starters based on his QB Elo rating.

Home teams are in bold.
The scoring system is nonlinear, so readers’ average points don’t necessarily match the number of points that would be given to the average reader prediction.
In Week 8, the readers did a nice job of hedging against the favored Bears and Bills (both of whom lost). But overall, it was a tough week for the prognosticators, who lost by an average of 26.8 points, their worst showing of the season to date. There weren’t any outright disagreements between Elo and the readers over the favorite, but the algorithm picked up points by shading in the right direction — particularly by having more confidence in the favored Saints, Texans, Lions, 49ers and Titans. Elo now has a 6-2 record against the field in 8 weeks so far this year.
Still, congratulations are in order to J A WILLIAMS, who led all (identified) readers in Week 8 with 348.0 points, and to Bill Fish, who grabbed the full-season contest lead with 694.1 points. Thanks to everyone who played — and if you haven’t, be sure to get in on the action! You can make picks now and try your luck against Elo, even if you missed Week 8.

Poll(s) of the week
About two weeks ago, we wrote that impeaching President Trump had near-majority support from the American public. This was notable because, at the beginning of October, Americans were about evenly divided on impeachment with just over 45 percent on each side, so there was some question whether this was a new normal or if the numbers would revert to the mean. But so far, support for impeachment hasn’t decreased. According to our impeachment polling tracker, if we look at all the polls, 49.1 percent of Americans support impeachment and 43.5 percent oppose it.
We can also drill down into the different types of questions asked about impeachment. For example, one of the views in our tracker only averages polls that ask Americans if they support beginning the impeachment process, while a separate view averages polls that ask if Americans support Trump’s impeachment and/or removal from office. And right now, there is more support for opening an inquiry than for full-blown impeachment. Currently, 53.1 percent of Americans support beginning the process, while 48.1 percent support impeachment and possible removal.
Support for beginning the impeachment process has been pretty stable, too, since it first shot up to 52.9 percent on Oct. 7. Support has hovered at 52-53 percent, though some of that stability is probably because fewer polls are asking about opening the inquiry. (And I would expect them to eventually taper off completely as the decision to open the inquiry becomes older and older news.)
And a new Quinnipiac poll illustrates some of this. It was the fourth time that Quinnipiac had asked whether Americans supported the impeachment inquiry (it first asked in late September), and it found that a majority of Americans — 55 percent — approve of the inquiry. This result was essentially the same as the previous times they asked: Approval of the inquiry has fluctuated slightly between 51 and 55 percent, while disapproval has remained stuck between 43 and 45 percent.
Support for impeaching and removing the president from office has also been relatively stable in Quinnipiac’s polling. The most recent poll found the country essentially evenly divided on whether Trump should be “impeached and removed from office” — 48 percent said he should be while 46 percent said he shouldn’t be, a gap that’s within the poll’s margin of error. Those numbers have only moved a couple points in either direction since the end of September. That said, our polling average suggests that support for impeachment may still be ticking upward. The increase since the beginning of the month has been slow but steady. As of Thursday night, 48.1 percent of Americans support impeachment and potential removal in our tracker’s average, while 43.7 percent oppose it.
Indeed, net support for impeachment and potential removal is higher in our average than in Quinnipiac’s polling. Our average is more in line with a CNN/SSRS poll released this week that found a full 50 percent of Americans said they believed Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 43 percent didn’t feel that way.
But arguably the more important measurement to look at is Trump’s approval rating. And at the beginning of October, Trump’s approval rating appeared to sharply decline as the Ukraine scandal unfolded. But his rating has not continued to plummet. Instead, it remains within the same narrow range that it has occupied for most of the year. However, it has slumped to the very bottom edge of that range. Currently, 40.6 percent of Americans approve of Trump and 54.6 percent disapprove — his worst numbers since February. So even if the bottom hasn’t dropped out, it’s possible that current events are keeping his popularity depressed.
Mind you, those events aren’t just limited to impeachment. Over the past two weeks, Trump has ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from their position defending Kurdish forces in Syria, and he proposed (then backtracked on) holding the next G-7 summit at his own resort in Florida. These actions drew rare rebukes from members of Trump’s own party, perhaps anticipating that Americans would find them especially serious (or signaling to the public that Trump had crossed a line).
But we’ve seen this movie enough times before to know that Trump’s approval rating might just as quickly perk back up next week. The current drop in Trump’s popularity may or may not be meaningful, but for now, recent events certainly aren’t doing him any favors politically. Indeed, if impeachment support continues to rise, it could be a rough winter for President Trump.
Other polling bites
Interestingly, even though the CNN/SSRS poll shows that Americans support impeaching Trump, that doesn’t mean they approve of how Congress is going about it. Only 43 percent approve of the way Democrats in Congress are handling the impeachment inquiry, while 49 percent disapprove. However, the numbers are much worse for Republicans in Congress: just 30 percent approve of the way they’re handling the inquiry and 57 percent disapprove. And Americans say, 50 percent to 40 percent, that Republicans oppose impeachment because they are out to protect Trump at all costs, not because they believe he did not commit impeachable offenses.
A final tidbit from that very meaty CNN/SSRS poll: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s net favorability rating (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) is just -2, which is a big improvement from her typical standing in recent years (for example, in September 2017, it was -21). In fact, Pelosi’s net favorability rating is the highest it’s been in CNN/SSRS’s polling since January 2009, which certainly suggests coming out for impeachment hasn’t hurt her.
This week, we got our first nonpartisan poll of the Mississippi governor’s race since July. According to Mason-Dixon Polling, Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves leads Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood just 46 percent to 43 percent. The election is on Nov. 5.
While national polls indicate that granting statehood to Washington, D.C., is unpopular with the public, a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll finds that Maryland residents support it, 51 percent to 40 percent. What they don’t want is retrocession, an alternative proposal to enfranchise Washingtonians by re-combining the District with Maryland. Marylanders oppose that idea 57 percent to 36 percent.
According to a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute, 55 percent of Republicans whose primary news source is Fox News say there is nothing that Trump could do to lose their approval. Only 29 percent of Republicans whose primary news source is not Fox News say that. PRRI also told The Washington Post that 71 percent of Fox-favoring Republicans strongly approve of Trump’s job performance, while only 39 percent of non-Fox-favoring Republicans do.
The World Series started on Tuesday, and according to an Ipsos poll conducted before Game 1, 46 percent of Americans planned to follow along. Of them, 37 percent were root, root, rooting for the Washington Nationals,1 while 33 percent wanted the Houston Astros to win2 (28 percent have no preference). However, Series watchers thought the Astros would win, 55 percent to 23 percent — although that was before the Nationals won the first two games of the seven-game series.
You may be too old to go trick-or-treating, but there’s another way to get your hands on those sweet, sweet Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. According to a YouGov poll, 74 percent of parents of children under 18 say they steal at least a few pieces of candy from their kids’ Halloween hauls. Four percent even say they eat all of it — now that’s scary.
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 40.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 54.6 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -14 points). At this time last week, 41.6 percent approved and 54.0 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -12.4 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 43.1 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.0 percent, for a net approval rating of -9.9 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.3 percentage points (46.6 percent to 40.3 percent). Those numbers are unchanged from a week ago. At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.8 points (46.8 percent to 40.0 percent).

Secrecy. That’s the big debate these days in impeachment land. For the past few weeks, the Democrats have invited a stream of bureaucrats to come before the House Intelligence Committee for closed-door testimony. (The White House tried to prevent them from doing so, but State Department officials and others keep on strolling in.) Perhaps most dramatic was the appearance of the senior U.S. envoy in Ukraine, William Taylor, before the committee. His detailed opening statement leaked, outlining his concern “that our relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular informal channel of U.S. policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons.” But that’s all that leaked, part of a House Democratic effort to run a relatively tight-lipped inquiry. The bureaucrats’ full testimonies are not yet public.
Providing stark contrast to the sorta-kinda closed-mouth Democrats are the lip-flapping Republicans, led by the commander in chief. President Trump likened the impeachment proceedings against him to “a lynching” in a tweet, a crass use of the term, given that thousands of black Americans were killed in lynchings throughout the country’s history. (In 1998, Joe Biden used the same term to describe impeachment efforts against President Bill Clinton.) The same Trump tweet repeated what has become a White House standard: that the president is being denied due process.
House Republicans, for their part, have tried to make an issue out of the Democrats’ closed-door policy. On Wednesday morning, a group of around 30 House Republicans, led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, tried to force their way into the House’s Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, aka, the SCIF, a facility purposely designed for dealing with protected information. Cell phones are not allowed into the facility, but the Republicans reportedly brought them in, taking pictures. Police were forced to do a sweep of the facility.
Despite the pressure, Democrats aren’t opening things up — yet. (One report indicated that a public phase to the inquiry could begin as soon as mid-November.) Rep. Adam Schiff, who is heading the inquiry, has said that one reason to keep testimony private for now is that it prevents witnesses from coordinating their statements. This measure seemed poised to bear some fruit this week: In the wake of Taylor’s testimony, some wondered whether Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland had perjured himself. Taylor said that Sondland told him that military aid and a White House meeting for the Ukrainians was contingent on their investigating Joe Biden’s son. Sondland, who has been trying to put some distance between himself and Rudy Giuliani’s back-channel foreign policy with Ukraine, said that he didn’t realize until later that Trump was looking for a quid pro quo.
Schiff has also promised that transcripts of the hearings will eventually be made public. But for now, the Democrats have the luxury of accumulating the various stories of the actors in L’affaire Ukrainienne. At some point, though, it might be to their advantage to release those stories to the public in a more manageable, defined narrative. The incremental release of information could potentially blunt the impact of the story on the public by allowing Republicans to pick apart pieces of information as they appear and obscure the central facts of the saga.
The way the public responds to the narration of the facts could have a real political impact on the presidential race and the popularity of congressional Democrats. While our impeachment tracker showed at publication time that 48.1 percent of Americans are in favor of impeaching the president, some recent polling nuggets could give Democrats pause. A Marquette University Law School Poll found that 44 percent of Wisconsin voters thought Trump should be impeached and removed from office, while 51 percent were opposed to that course of action. (Wisconsin was the so-called tipping point state in the 2016 election.) The New York Times and Siena College conducted a poll of six swing states and found that registered voters support the impeachment inquiry at a margin of 50 percent to 45 percent but oppose impeaching Trump and removing him from office, 53 percent to 43 percent. That paradoxical pair of numbers is some indication of the division over whether seeking impeachment is sound practice during a presidential election year. Voters in those swing states might be a bit more hesitant about the prospect. Nationally, though, our poll tracker sees more support for both starting the inquiry and impeaching Trump.
That said, the impeachment narrative has far to go: We’re only a month in, after all, and the full extent of the facts is still being kept under wraps. For now.
CORRECTION (Oct. 29, 2019, 4:05 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of Wisconsin registered voters who, according to a recent Marquette University Law School poll, said that President Trump should not be impeached and removed from office.

Walker, the Montreal Expos’ 27-year-old right fielder, had been hitting well enough in the World Series before the bottom of the 11th inning in Game 7. But he’d also been held homerless until coming up in this crucial spot, with two runners on base in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 7. As the championship hung in the balance, one swing changed everything. A year after Joe Carter won the 1993 World Series for another Canadian team with a walk-off home run, Walker crushed Wickman’s pitch over the wall in right for a title-clinching blast of his own. As he circled the bases at Stade Olympique, confetti raining down, Walker relished in knowing he had created one of the most indelible feel-good moments in the history of the game.
The Expos were 1994 World Champions.
None of that actually happened, of course. When the team formerly known as the Expos — now called the Washington Nationals, after moving from Canada to D.C. back in 2005 — took the field in Tuesday’s World Series Game 1, it was the very first Fall Classic appearance in franchise history, regardless of home city. But fans of the club’s earlier incarnation, Les Expos, will always wonder about the one that got away 25 years ago. The 1994 baseball season ended with a players’ strike on Aug. 12, and with that, countless what-ifs were launched. So let’s talk about them. What if the season hadn’t ended? What if, instead, ’94 had been allowed to play out as scheduled? Would Roger Maris’s home run record have been broken early? Would Tony Gwynn have hit .400? Would the Expos, owners of an MLB-best 74-40 record when play ceased, have actually won the World Series?
To help find the answers, we reached out to the makers of Out Of The Park (OOTP), a baseball simulation game we’ve partnered with before on such topics as Bryce Harper’s free agency and designated hitters in the National League. This time, we asked them to run a bunch of simulations of the 1994 season, from the moment of the strike through the end of the World Series, and track how often various significant individual and team accomplishments happened. (For example, the Walker home run from above came from Simulation No. 55 of the World Series matchup between the Expos and their most common World Series simulation opponent, the Yankees.)
If the 1994 season couldn’t exist in reality, at least many versions of it can play out on the virtual diamond. What follows is a rundown of what OOTP thinks was most likely to have happened in an alternate universe where the season could be played to completion.
Let’s start with the regular season. Here is what OOTP’s simulations think the standings — which newly included a wild-card playoff slot for teams that didn’t win their divisions — would have looked like if the season was allowed to play out normally:

In the American League, the playoff field would very likely have included the Yankees out of the East — thus snapping a 12-season drought for the Bronx Bombers — plus the White Sox (who had lost the League Championship Series the previous year) and the Indians from the brand-new Central division. And somebody had to win the abysmal four-team AL West, although OOTP thinks the winner — whether it was Oakland or Texas, or maybe even someone else — would very likely have carried a below-.500 record, probably joining the 1981 Royals as the only team in baseball history to make the postseason with a losing regular-season mark.

As for the NL, the Expos would almost certainly have made the playoffs, probably as East champs over the defending West champion Braves, who’d been realigned into a more proper geographic bucket when the third division was added. (Incidentally, this would probably have interrupted Atlanta’s real-life streak of consecutive division titles, which reached 14 only on the technicality that play was suspended in 1994.) But the Braves were very likely to have won the wild card, joining the West champion Dodgers and either the Reds or Astros out of the Central to round out the playoff field in ’94.
In terms of individual performances, Maris’s record of 61 home runs was broken 188 times in the 1,000 simulations OOTP ran — 145 by Giants third baseman Matt Williams (who had 43 homers when play ceased), 24 by Mariners center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. (who had 40) and 19 by others — and tied another 102 times. Because it’s possible that more than one of these performances could happen in the same season, there was about a 27 percent chance that somebody would have at least tied Maris’s record in 1994 and an 18 percent chance the record would have been outright broken.

The record would eventually go down anyway thanks to Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa’s home run chase in 1998, which itself had a tremendous ripple effect on baseball history through the subsequent steroids scandal. We don’t know how later seasons would have played out if the record had been broken in ’94, but we can say there was a not-insignificant chance that Maris’s mark would have been surpassed in a universe without the strike.
Meanwhile, the other big historical chase of note in 1994 was obviously Chuck Knoblauch’s pursuit of the all-time doubles record, 67, set by Earl Webb in 1931. Just kidding. (Although OOTP thinks there was a 3.1 percent chance Knoblauch would hit 68 or more doubles, and a 1.1 percent chance for Craig Biggio as well.) The actual marquee pursuit belonged to Gwynn, the legendary Padres outfielder who had his eye on becoming MLB’s first .400 hitter since Ted Williams did it in 1941. Gwynn was hitting .394 when the strike happened and had been at .400 as recently as May. (He was also heating up right before the strike, hitting .475 in the first 11 days of August.)

According to OOTP’s simulations, there was about a 31 percent chance that Gwynn would finish the season with a batting average of at least .400 — including one incredible simulation that had Gwynn hitting .430, which would have been the highest average by an MLB hitter since 1894 (and the third-highest ever).
(There was even another stray simulation in which Yankees right fielder Paul O’Neill, who sported a .359 mark at the strike, ended the season with an average of exactly .400. That would truly be the .400 season nobody saw coming.)
But the biggest what-ifs around the 1994 campaign involve its lost postseason and whether a team like the Expos would have actually been able to win the World Series if it hadn’t been canceled. Here’s how OOTP’s simulations set the odds of each potential playoff team reaching each round of the 1994 postseason:

The Yankees were the most probable pennant winner in the AL, despite the rule at the time that would likely have pitted them against the formidable Indians (who would go on to play in two of the next three World Series) in the Division Series.1 Following somewhat further behind them in World Series odds were the star-studded White Sox (of Frank Thomas and Jack McDowell) and Indians (Kenny Lofton; Albert Belle) as well as the last vestiges of the Rickey Henderson-era Oakland A’s. There was about a 64 percent chance that either the Yankees or White Sox would have represented the AL in the 1994 World Series.
Over in the NL, it was a close race for the most likely pennant winner. Despite having the league’s best record, OOTP gave the Expos only the second-best probability of making the World Series (25 percent), trailing the division-rival Braves (27 percent). Why? Atlanta had a slightly higher-rated group of players — including a number of eventual Hall of Famers — after making two of the previous three World Series, while Montreal had taken a more recent quantum leap forward over the previous two seasons. And the Reds were in the NL pennant conversation, too, at 23 percent, not having been too far removed from winning the 1990 World Series. (Top players Barry Larkin and José Rijo were the cornerstones of that team as well.) Further, about 75 percent of OOTP’s sims had either Atlanta, Montreal or Cincinnati making the World Series out of the NL. Combining all of these numbers together, here’s a matrix of what the most probable World Series matchups would have been in 1994:

(Unfortunately, an Expos-Astros World Series that season would have been impossible — both were in the National League at the time. How things change!)
Based on these combinations, here’s what OOTP’s simulations would have seen in store for the four most likely 1994 World Series matchups:
Yankees vs. Braves: We’d get to see a version of this one two seasons later, when the Yankees came back from a mere 14.2 percent chance of winning the World Series (at their low point) to capture the proud franchise’s first championship since 1978. This hypothetical World Series’s cast would have featured many of the same characters as in ’96, except with Buck Showalter managing New York, Don Mattingly still in pinstripes, and no Andy Pettitte, Mariano Rivera or Derek Jeter for the Yankees or Marquis Grissom for the Braves. OOTP thinks the Yankees would have the edge, tagging the vaunted Braves rotation for a .314 batting average and 5.7 runs per game.
Chance of happening: 10 percentFavorite: Yankees (55 percent)
Most Likely Outcome: Yankees in six (21 percent)
Most Likely MVPs:2 Atlanta 1B Fred McGriff (15 percent); New York RF O’Neill (13 percent)
Yankees vs. Expos: Although I chose to dramatize the Expos’ win in Simulation 55 for the lede of this story, OOTP has the Yankees beating Montreal in more simulations than not. The Expos did have the superior pitching staff (either by WAR or OOTP’s player ratings) in 1994, and they hit more home runs and stole more bases than the Yankees in the head-to-head simulations. But New York played better defense and ultimately scratched out more runs per game on average, led as they were by a deeper group of position-player talent. Then again, this just makes the Expos underdogs — and what better way for Montreal’s storybook season to end than in an upset victory over the Yankees?
Chance of happening: 9 percentFavorite: Yankees (57 percent)Most Likely Outcome: Yankees in six (24 percent)Most Likely MVPs: New York CF Bernie Williams (15 percent); Montreal RF Walker (15 percent)
Reds vs. Yankees: The Reds haven’t been the most successful of teams recently, having won only five postseason games since 1990. But if the strike hadn’t happened, there’s a chance Cincinnati could have added a second title of the 1990s to its trophy cabinet. In this head-to-head matchup with the Yankees, the Reds muscled past New York more often than not, thanks to the superior power of left fielder Kevin Mitchell — and the superior power pitching of starter Rijo and the rest of the Cincy rotation. Outhomering the Yankees by an average of 6.9 to 4.9 per series, Cincinnati victimized N.Y. starters Jimmy Key and Jim Abbott alone for 2.3 of them on average.Chance of happening: 8 percentFavorite: Reds (55 percent)Most Likely Outcome: Reds in six (18 percent)Most Likely MVPs: Cincinnati LF Mitchell (20 percent); New York RF O’Neill (19 percent)
Braves vs. White Sox: The most interesting potential 1994 matchup could be the one nobody ever talks about: the Bravos versus the Pale Hose. In OOTP’s simulations of the matchup, it was a perfectly even split in terms of who would win — the Braves swept more often, the ChiSox won in six more often, and the teams were dead-even in terms of winning in either five or seven games. The star power in this one goes unappreciated, between the Braves’ staff of aces, actual 1994 AL MVP Frank Thomas and a bunch of other supporting talent (McGriff, Robin Ventura, etc). The showdown of starters would also have ranked among the best in World Series history, with each rotation ranking among the Top 4 in both WAR and OOTP’s rankings. Cumulatively, the Braves won more total games across all of the simulated series, so you could call that an edge for Atlanta. But if it had happened, this World Series would probably have been a closely matched thriller.Chance of happening: 7 percentFavorite: PUSH! (50-50 split)Most Likely Outcome: White Sox in 6 (16 percent)Most Likely MVPs: Atlanta SP Greg Maddux (24 percent); Chicago 1B Thomas (20 percent)
All told, here’s who OOTP’s reconstructions of the 1994 stretch run and playoffs think the most likely World Series winners that year would have been:

Perhaps surprisingly, many fans’ default belief — that the strike cost the Expos a certain title, and maybe even their future in Montreal — isn’t fully supported by OOTP’s simulations. Instead, it thinks the bigger victims were three teams who would each win titles within 11 years of the lost ’94 postseason. And in that sense, maybe it’s better that we don’t know who would have won. The romance of Montreal’s missing championship will exist forever in fans’ minds, even if it wasn’t actually as likely as it seems in hindsight. And hey — it also existed in 12 percent of the computer’s simulations, including Walker’s heroics in OOTP alternate universe No. 55.

Elizabeth Warren has made a name for herself in the Democratic primary as a woman with a plan. Her liberal policy proposals are sweeping and often expensive, a fact that her rivals have seized upon as she has risen in the polls. And the policy that is intended to fund her vision is no less ambitious.
Warren wants to tax the country’s richest citizens on their accumulated wealth, not just their income. Instead of a more traditional approach to raising money from the rich, like hiking income tax rates, Warren’s wealth tax plan proposes a radical new approach to taxation that would target the fortunes of the nation’s wealthiest people by imposing a tax on all household assets — not just income — above the $50 million mark. And Sen. Bernie Sanders has even announced a more aggressive proposal that would cut some billionaires’ wealth in half in 15 years.
The idea of using a wealth tax to fund some of 2020’s bigger policy proposals is seductive. If it works, it could kill two birds with one stone — both curbing rising income inequality by redistributing some of billionaires’ wealth and providing a new source of tax money to fund social programs. It’s pretty popular, too, among Democratic primary voters. But while most Democratic candidates are united around the idea that the rich should be paying more in taxes, they’re not all convinced that a wealth tax is the best way to do it. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang has expressed skepticism about how it would work in practice, saying that it would have “massive implementation problems,” while Sen. Amy Klobuchar has said, “When I look at this, I think about Donald Trump,” suggesting that the plan might be too divisive for a general election.
How serious a problem are these criticisms for Warren? Could her rivals in the primary undercut one of her signature ideas by arguing that a wealth tax is the wrong solution to the problem of income inequality? There is a debate percolating among experts about whether her plan is practical or even constitutional. But there’s also disagreement about how fatal those flaws would be.
Part of the problem in trying to gauge the potential flaws of a wealth tax is it simply hasn’t been tried in the U.S. before, so we don’t know exactly how much money it would raise or how it would fare in the courts. Economists on Warren’s team have estimated that her wealth tax could raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years while Sanders’s camp has estimated their version would raise over $4 trillion in new revenue over the same span. That is quite a windfall — if they can pull it off. But even some left-leaning experts are skeptical it’ll raise that much money.
Additionally, a wealth tax would almost certainly face a legal challenge from well-funded conservative opponents. And it’s genuinely unclear whether it would ultimately be ruled constitutional. The issue isn’t that Congress can’t enact a wealth tax. It’s that if a wealth tax counts as a “direct” tax, Congress would have to ensure that the amount of money coming from each state was roughly the same on a per-capita basis, as there is a provision of the Constitution that bans direct taxes unless the amount collected is drawn equally from the states based on their populations. Given that wealth is not evenly distributed across the states, that equal distribution would be functionally impossible to ensure.
The fate of a wealth tax, then, would hinge on whether it counts as a direct tax. That’s a tough question to answer, because the Constitution itself doesn’t really define what a direct tax is, beyond the fact that the category includes a poll tax, which is a fixed amount charged for every person. Taxes like tariffs and certain others that can’t be fairly distributed on a per-person basis are generally not considered direct taxes. But how all of this would apply to a wealth tax isn’t entirely clear. The Supreme Court weighed in on this question more than 100 years ago — and not in the wealth tax’s favor. In 1895, the court struck down a federal income tax law because it taxed income generated from property, including land and other kinds of personal property, like stocks and bonds. The decision was controversial, and Congress and the states effectively reversed part of it 20 years later with the passage of the 16th Amendment which allowed Congress to tax income without worrying about how evenly it was distributed. But Congress’s authority to tax wealth wasn’t addressed by the amendment, and the Supreme Court hasn’t really returned to the issue in the past century.
Warren’s defenders argue, however, that the court simply got it wrong back in 1895, and that a modern wealth tax wouldn’t count as a direct tax. But the court’s right-leaning justices might approach the tax with a less favorable eye. And the existence of the old precedent could give the court’s conservative justices a way to dispatch a wealth tax relatively easily, which gives experts like Daniel Hemel pause. “A wealth tax could raise trillions of dollars — or, if it’s struck down by the Supreme Court, it could raise nothing,” said Hemel, a law professor at the University of Chicago. “That’s a really big risk if you care about the redistribution of income and you’re trying to figure out how to get it done.”
Then there are the critics who have argued that even if a wealth tax could survive a legal battle, it would be a nightmare to implement and might not raise as much money as Warren and Sanders have claimed. Yang, in particular, has homed in recently on the practical shortcomings of a wealth tax. In the October debate, he pointed out that many European countries tried wealth taxes of their own but eventually abandoned them, in part because they proved so difficult to administer.
True, the comparison between the U.S. and Europe may not be entirely apt. For one thing, many European millionaires simply moved to neighboring countries to escape the wealth taxes, which would be harder for Americans to pull off. But one lesson that probably would translate, according to Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, is that a wealth tax would be difficult to enforce.
One central concern is that the rich, who are already good at evading taxes, would find new and creative ways to avoid paying taxes on their wealth. Part of the issue is that while income and certain kinds of wealth, like stocks, are easily verifiable, the value of a privately held company or a piece of art is genuinely hard to pin down. And the people targeted by the wealth tax also have the means to hire tax lawyers and accountants to sift through the law in search of loopholes. “I think a wealth tax would certainly raise a significant amount of money,” Holtzblatt said. “But will it raise enough money to pay for everything that’s been suggested? That’s a much harder question to answer.”
From a practical perspective, several experts told me that if the goal is to squeeze more tax revenue out of the rich, there is lower-hanging fruit politicians can go after. But the aspects of a wealth tax that make some tax professors and economists squirm — its newness and its focus on the super-rich — are likely part of what makes it so appealing to voters. A New York Times/SurveyMonkey poll conducted in July, for instance, found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, support Warren’s proposal. Other tax plans floated by the candidates, like lowering the threshold for the estate tax or establishing a universal basic income, have received significantly less support in polls.
So if nothing else, the wealth tax has been a very successful symbol of the idea that the wealthy should pay their fair share. Sanders’s version of the wealth tax would affect more people and explicitly seeks to make billionaires an endangered species, which could make it more vulnerable to criticism. Warren, meanwhile, has so far taken pains to downplay the radicalness of a wealth tax, painting it as a modest strategy for tackling a broken tax system. But the political risks are still real for Warren, especially if her critics decide they want to focus on the details.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

After all, 12 candidates made the stage in October, and nine have already qualified for the November debate. But on Friday, the Democratic National Committee released its strictest qualifying criteria yet, raising both the polling and donor thresholds for the December debate. And it looks like the new rules could be a thorn in the side of many candidates who have qualified for recent debates.
To make the stage in December, candidates must attract 4 percent support in four national or early-state polls or 6 percent in two early-state polls1 between Oct. 16 and Dec. 12 and collect contributions from 200,000 unique donors (including at least 800 donors in at least 20 states or territories).2 And at this point, eight candidates have met the donor mark by our count, but only former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have qualified. Of the four qualifying polls released so far, they’re the only candidates to have reached 4 percent in all four (or 6 percent in two early-state polls).

*For candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight.
To qualify for the sixth debate, a candidate must reach 4 percent in at least four national or early-state polls or 6 percent in at least two early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations. Candidates must also have at least 200,000 unique donors, including at least 800 donors in at least 20 states or territories. Information released by campaigns is used to determine whether a candidate has hit the donor threshold. If a campaign announced it had reached 200,000 donors but did not say whether it had at least 800 donors in 20 states, we assumed that it had met the latter requirement as well.
Sources: POLLS, CAMPAIGNS, MEDIA REPORTS
But with over a month to still qualify, it’s likely at least two more candidates will make the cut. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris each only need one more poll to qualify. After that, however, the likelihood that the other candidates qualify becomes, well, debatable. The only other candidate who has a single qualifying poll is billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who hit 4 percent in Monmouth University’s recent South Carolina poll. He hasn’t yet hit the 200,000 donor mark (he’s at 166,000, according to his campaign), but given his strong polling numbers in early-state polls, thanks in large part to the staggering amount of money he’s dropped on ads, Steyer might still get the four qualifying polls he needs.
Meanwhile, the other six candidates who made the October debate could have an even tougher time, especially with the new polling requirements. Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang each have enough donors, but hitting 4 percent support in polls may prove challenging. Yang has only hit 4 percent twice in surveys that count toward the November debate while O’Rourke has only hit 4 percent once. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has also met the donor mark, but she hasn’t exceeded 3 percent in any November debate poll. As for Sen. Cory Booker, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, they’re in real jeopardy of not making the December debate. At this stage, none of them have met the new donor threshold, and none have a single poll for the November debate where they’ve earned above 3 percent.
There’s also little evidence that the remaining “major” candidates based on FiveThirtyEight’s criteria will qualify for the sixth debate. Only author and motivational speaker Marianne Williamson has a real shot at reaching the 200,000-donor threshold — she previously met the 130,000 requirement for the September debate. But her campaign hasn’t reported an updated contributor count for the fifth or sixth debates, and even if she did hit the donor mark, Williamson is unlikely to get enough support in the polls to make the November debate, much less the December one.
Although many candidates will reach the donor threshold for the sixth debate — eight already have and more likely will — it looks like the stricter polling requirement will make it tougher sledding for many of them. So don’t be shocked if fewer than 10 candidates make the December stage.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

This week, let’s focus on the teams just below that tier — those that had four wins last week and those that got to four wins this weekend. That’s the entire AFC South, the Cowboys, the Eagles, the Panthers and the Rams.
Which of those teams do you all think can still make the playoffs? (Obviously someone out of the AFC South.)
joshua.hermsmeyer (Josh Hermsmeyer, NFL analyst): I like the Texans and the Cowboys out of that bunch. They have the highest offensive expected points added per play on early downs.
neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): I don’t know if Indy will hang onto the South — I’m with you, Josh, in thinking the Texans are better — but the way the Colts have played after everyone (us included) wrote them off when Andrew Luck retired has been impressive. The supporting cast around Jacoby Brissett has done well (ironic, given the knock on Indy was that Luck was doing everything by himself), and Brissett has done an admirable job as a stand-in.

*After 6, 7 or 8 games; the latest game in a season available within that range
Sources: Pro-Football-Reference, ESPN
neil: He’s no Steve Young replacing Joe Montana, but he’s not terrible.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Yeah, I should take the L publicly for saying they were a near lock to be 8-8 with Brissett.
Salfino (Michael Salfino, FiveThirtyEight contributor): Brissett is generating far more touchdowns per pass than we might expect from his yards per attempt. He has a 6.1 percent touchdown rate, which ranks fourth in the league, but only 6.9 yards per attempt, which ranks 22nd, so I think the Colts offense is due for serious negative regression (unless Brissett’s overall efficiency improves).
While the Colts are really well coached and get the most out of what they have, I think the Texans — given the talent and production at QB — are the team to beat in the South and a team I would not want to have to defend. But is their defense suspect now without J.J. Watt, who is out for the year?
Of all these team, for me, it’s still the Texas teams, Houston and Dallas.
sara.ziegler: The team I’m most confused about is Philadelphia. The Eagles seem so up and down from week to week.
neil: Maybe Orlando Scandrick was the problem after all!
Salfino: The Eagles have to feel much better about themselves off the game in Buffalo, even if we believe that the Bills (like Josh said last week) are a paper tiger.
joshua.hermsmeyer: The Eagles are just Not Very Good on offense this season. They’re basically average on early downs, and their record reflects it.
neil: But they probably still have the talent to be better than that. And for Philly against Buffalo, I think a lot of people had that game circled for upset potential. The Bills had been playing above their heads as much as the Eagles were underachieving.
Salfino: My problem with the Eagles is that they have zero explosiveness on offense other than Miles Sanders (running and receiving), who they don’t seem to want to play (and who now has a shoulder injury).
neil: True. And even against Buffalo, it was a very run-heavy focus.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Agreed. And I think the weather played to their defensive strengths. The Eagles like to play a “gap sound” defense — where every run gap is accounted for on most plays — that makes it hard to run on them.
sara.ziegler: So what can we expect from the Eagles for the rest of the season? They have an incomprehensible Bears team next, then the Patriots, then the Seahawks — but then in the final five games of the season they get Miami and Washington, plus they get the Giants twice.
Salfino: The Eagles must win two of their next three, which are all at home.
neil: Our Elo model thinks Philly is favored in seven of its final eight games.
sara.ziegler: Against everyone but New England?
neil: Right.

sara.ziegler: Even against Dallas! That’s so interesting.
neil: Well, it’s at home, and Elo thinks the two teams are basically equivalent, even after the beatdown Dallas laid on Philly a few weeks back.
That’s a big reason why the two teams are essentially 50-50 to win the NFC East right now.
sara.ziegler: I can’t figure out Dallas, either. Was that loss to the Jets just a blip?
Salfino: I do think it was a blip. What is Dallas’s weakness on the field? You can say it’s coaching off the field, I will stipulate to that. But the players are generally good. It comes down to whether you believe Dak Prescott is good or great.
joshua.hermsmeyer: When the Cowboys have won, they’ve looked like a team that can go deep into the playoffs: great QB play, a good line and rushing attack, and creative play-calling. All of that is coupled with a strong pass rush on defense to take advantage of leads late by applying pressure. I think that’s the version of the team that’s closest to its true identity. I think they need to get out of their own way to a large extent — especially head coach Jason Garrett.
sara.ziegler: The other Texas team you mentioned, Josh, was Houston, which needed some Deshaun Watson heroics to beat Oakland on Sunday. How much does Watt’s injury matter to the Texans’ playoff hopes?
joshua.hermsmeyer: Gosh, I think it’s a big deal. He was 12th in the league in Pass Rush Win Rate, and the team has a bunch of other injuries to deal with as well.
Salfino: Watson made a forever highlight play Sunday on the game-winning TD when he escaped a certain sack and threw the game-winning TD while being kicked in the face. That reminded me of this:

joshua.hermsmeyer: And with Texans head coach Bill O’Brien selling picks in hopes of winning something this season, I think maybe their window closes if they can’t get to the playoffs. So desperate times in Houston, in my view.
Salfino: Raiders coach Jon Gruden said Watson is like Michael Jordan. If he’s right, the Texans can, of course, beat anyone. Their defense wasn’t good, though, even with Watt. So the pressure is on Watson to score pretty much on every drive.
neil: According to Elo, Watson is the second-highest-rated starting QB in the league, behind Pat Mahomes and tied with Aaron Rodgers. So we are definitely talking about that kind of star QB.
Salfino: To Josh’s point, I don’t think the window ever closes for a team with a franchise QB. A franchise QB turns second-round picks into first-round picks — he makes everyone better. Like Peyton Manning did.
sara.ziegler: What about the two 4-4 teams in the AFC South — the Jaguars and Titans?
neil: Titans won the battle of what might be the two worst uniforms in the league this week, against the Bucs.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Yes, Neil!
As for the Jags, I don’t think you can bench the Constant Gardner.
neil: LOL
neil: Maybe they can send Nick Foles back to the Eagles, if so many players in Philly want him back.
Salfino: I can’t see any January relevance for either of those teams. What happens to Gardner Minshew is going to be very interesting. Foles has not done anything to lose his job, obviously. It’s hard to find games that you think he wouldn’t have won that Minshew did. And the money is a very big deal — the Jaguars are stuck with Foles. They probably also wooed him with promises that they now may have to break, which is awkward.
neil: Yeah, although Minshew played well against the Jets, our model still doesn’t think he’s anything more than a very low-tier starter.
Salfino: To me, the play is give the ball to Foles when he returns from injury but keep him on a short leash. That way if he doesn’t live up to expectations, you can go back to Minshew. If you stick with Minshew, how do you ever go back to Foles? You’re saying Minshew is your QB.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Foles was never better than average — except for the very memorable Super Bowl run with the Eagles — and so I think availability bias colors everything. I also question if Foles makes the plays under pressure and out of structure that Minshew has made.
Salfino: Plus Minshew is a major trade chip. He will definitely get a mid-first-round pick in exchange. The Cowboys once got Tony Dorsett, basically, because of what Clint Longley did in one half of a Thanksgiving game. Desperate teams will always buy the hope at QB, and Minshew provides reasonable hope. Plus, of course, he’s super cheap for the acquiring team. Of course, Longley sucker punched Roger Staubach, so he sort of had to go — but still the Cowboys got major draft capital.

neil: Clint Longley!
What about Browning Nagle though?
joshua.hermsmeyer: I cannot in good conscience support this idea of trading a talented cheap young QB and riding with Nick Foles. Mike, it’s too early for that kind of gamble.
neil: Poor Foles. How many times can this happen to him?
Salfino: I’m not saying I would do that in a vacuum, but Foles has a $34 million salary cap charge next year. They’ll be saddled with an expensive QB no matter what they do with Minshew, so they may as well get the draft capital.
neil: Meanwhile, you’ve got the Titans winning with Ryan Tannehill after benching Marcus Mariota. That’s another not-so-cheap QB riding the pine.
sara.ziegler: Speaking of talented, cheap QBs … how about Kyle Allen!
joshua.hermsmeyer: He finally got intercepted.


Lmao https://t.co/HT3mKV4xnP
— Richard Sherman (@RSherman_25) October 28, 2019

sara.ziegler: The Niners will do that to you.
neil: That performance felt like it was coming for a while.
Salfino: Those interception stats are more fluke than fact.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Sherm agrees.
neil: Yes, and prior to this game, the Panthers were winning, but not really because of Kyle Allen.
Salfino: Exactly. Like Minshew, really. Cam Newton would have won all those games if healthy, let’s be real. Like Foles would have.
neil: Carolina is probably glad they got it out of the way so there isn’t a whiff of “Should Allen start even when Cam is healthy?”
Salfino: There will still be a whiff.
sara.ziegler: That seems absurd, but you’re probably right.
neil: How about the 49ers, though? What a performance. After people like me were wondering if they were legit in last week’s chat.
Salfino: I think they’re winning the Super Bowl. Can they continue to generate explosive running plays? It’s a weird recipe for offensive success. George Kittle, to the chagrin of fantasy football, can’t find the end zone. He has six TDs on his last 1,839 receiving yards, dating back to the start of last season.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Imagine how good they would be with a QB.
sara.ziegler: LOL
neil: Who needs a QB when you have Nick Bosa?
That was the first game in PFR’s database where a player had three or more sacks and an interception in the same game.
Salfino: My eyes tell me that Bosa is the most impactful rookie defender since Lawrence Taylor. But the stats? They’re not that great. They’re merely good.
Sherman says Bosa should be in the defensive MVP talk. Since we’re citing Sherman (as we should because he’s very citable).
neil: A generational citational talent!
joshua.hermsmeyer: I think that’s a great compliment and an incredible example of football bridging seemingly intractable cultural divides. What SF has done this season is kind of a marvel of management.
Salfino: I think once you put on the uniform, that’s your tribe. It’s one of the charming things about sports. I bet Sherman does not care at all about Bosa’s politics.
sara.ziegler: The one last middle-tier team that’s left is the team looking up at the Niners (and the Seahawks): the Los Angeles Rams. Are they getting their problems worked out?
joshua.hermsmeyer: I have no real evidence for this take, but my sense is no, they are not very good and will not make the playoffs. I think it has to do with the fact that they really are a run-first team, and head coach Sean McVay hasn’t been able to run his wide zone stuff like he used to. Now teams are forcing Jared Goff to beat them without the play-action plays that McVay called off those no-longer-successful run plays. It’s like he’s reinventing his offense on the fly.
Salfino: What can you take from that game against the 0-8 Bengals? I heard that with a loss, Andy Dalton would be the first QB since 1950 to start one season 8-0 (2015) and another 0-8. He lost.
I agree with Josh. Remember that, on average, nearly half of all playoff teams do not repeat as playoff teams the following season, so the Rams being out this year would not be that big a deal.
sara.ziegler: I was much happier with Goff’s fantasy performance this week, so that’s all that matters to me
Salfino: Goff got his yards per attempt cleaned up, for sure, since the Bengals apparently decided not to cover Cooper Kupp. It was a strategy.
neil: 220 receiving yards for Kupp! Look out, Flipper Anderson.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Sneaky 220 yards from Cooper. Lot of grit shown.
Salfino: Cooper has deceptive speed. 🙂
neil: But basically, circle Dec. 8 on the calendar for the Seahawks and Rams.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Agreed!
neil: For what it’s worth, Los Angeles has a much easier remaining schedule; our model has the Rams favored six times in the last eight games, with an average win probability of 61 percent. Seattle is favored only twice, with an average win probability of 49 percent.
sara.ziegler: But they’re both just chasing the Niners — what an interesting season! Could it be San Francisco-New England in the Super Bowl?
Salfino: We had to get this photo with Odell Beckham Jr., Tom Brady and Baker Mayfield into the chat.
Never leave a meme on the table.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-astros-are-hitting-like-the-1927-yankees/,2019-10-29,,,features,"Oct. 29, 2019",The Astros Are Hitting Like The 1927 Yankees,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"WASHINGTON — On the Astros’ charter flight to Washington, D.C., last week, after they had fallen to an 0-2 deficit in the World Series, Houston hitters held discussions at 30,000 feet about how they had tried to do too much as individuals in the first two games of the series. If any team should trust that the next player in the lineup can meet the demands of the game, it’s these Astros.
In Washington, the Astros got back to being themselves. They outscored the Nationals 19-3 in their three-game sweep and are one win away from their second title in three years. They feature one of the most loaded lineups in major league history, performing something like the Yankees’ Murderers’ Row of the 1920s. In fact, by some measures, the only more effective offensive club in the history of the sport is the storied 1927 New York club.
The Astros finished the regular season with the second-best mark in weighted runs created plus (wRC+), which adjusts for era and ballparks, of all time. The ’27 Yankees produced a 126 mark as a team, meaning they were 26 percent above league average run-production efficiency. The ’19 Astros finished at 125 — and that’s the top of the list. For context, erstwhile Nationals star Bryce Harper produced a 125 wRC+ for the Philadelphia Phillies this season. The Astros are a team of Harpers. MLB has rarely seen anything like it.

While Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg were momentarily able to quiet the Astros’ bats in Houston, the Nationals ran out of elite-level performances back on their home turf. Another top Washington starter, Patrick Corbin, faltered in a crucial spot against the Astros’ lineup on Saturday, and Scherzer’s Game 5 start the following day was scratched because of neck and back spasms. Scherzer struggled to turn toward reporters during a pregame press conference on Sunday, and his status for the remainder of the series is unclear. The Nats sent their No. 5 starter, Joe Ross, out against the Astros on Sunday night, and the ballpark knew what he was up against: Ross received a standing ovation as he walked to the bullpen to warm up. The outpouring was not enough — the Nats were overmatched.
Legend has it that the 1927 Yankees intimidated the Pittsburgh Pirates with their batting practice display before Game 1 of the World Series en route to a series sweep. The Astros have plenty of power, ranking third this season in home runs. But the Astros offense doesn’t intimidate only through home run displays — it also features a nonstop barrage of quality at-bats. There are no breaks in the lineup. There are rarely easy outs. The Astros had the lowest strikeout rate in baseball this year and led MLB in on-base percentage (.352) — ahead of the No. 2 Nationals by 10 points. They rarely chase pitches, and that has continued in the playoffs.
The Astros are so deep that the Nationals, in the sixth inning of Game 3, elected to load the bases with an intentional walk to Michael Brantley so Nats reliever Fernando Rodney could instead face Alex Bregman, an AL MVP candidate. Bregman grounded out, but the following night he again faced Rodney with the bases loaded. Though Rodney made the pitch he wanted — a down-and-in, 93 mph sinking fastball that caught the corner — Bregman barreled it and sent it out to left for a grand slam that gave the Astros an 8-1 lead.
Bregman said he had been working on some mechanical tweaks that began to come together Saturday. “The one, I was trying to get the ball in the air and just drive in a run,” Bregman told reporters afterward. “I just think we’re better when we have fun, and we had fun the last two days.”
Make it three days. The Astros seemed to be loose and enjoying the moment on Sunday. Bregman was seen smiling and laughing on the field for batting practice before Game 5 with rookie teammate Kyle Tucker, who was part of his hitting group. On many teams, Tucker — who produced 38 home runs and 35 steals between Triple-A and the majors this season — would already be a staple. On the Astros, he’s a pinch hitter.
Even Robinson Chirinos, part of a catching timeshare in Houston, is an above-average hitter. He launched a home run in Game 3 out of the eighth spot in the batting order.
Washington’s Juan Soto isn’t the only elite-level young player in the Series. While 22-year-old Houston wunderkind Yordan Álvarez had struggled for much of October, he launched a two-run homer in the second inning on Sunday — one of three two-run homers crushed by the Astros in their 7-1 win — and would add two other hits.
“He’s done this the whole year, but this postseason, as he’s tried to find his way, it was nice to see him stay within himself,” Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.
And batting seventh — seventh — for much of October has been Carlos Correa, who hit a two-run homer in the fourth on Sunday. The club’s shortstop posted a 143 wRC+ in the regular season — elite production for any hitter, let alone one manning the most athletically challenging position. He has the most home runs, RBIs and extra-base hits in postseason history before age 26.
“On the way here from the plane, I was talking to [teammate José Altuve], and I was like, José, we need to get our swagger back,” Correa said.
Even the Astros’ relatively weaker links are stars. And that’s a big reason why one of the great lineups in MLB history flew home to Houston, one win from a World Series title.

250 miles of protected bike lanes
Cyclists in New York City have been dying at a record rate, with 25 deaths this year alone, the highest in 20 years. A new $1.7 billion plan would expand the number of protected bike lanes by 250 miles as part of a bill expected to be approved by City Council on Wednesday. The plan also calls for greater implementation of a system that allows buses to turn traffic lights green to help speed up routes. [New York Times]
4 styles
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Finding the perfect pair of jeans can be tricky. Sometimes the color is right, but the style is off. Or the fit is right, but the material just isn’t comfortable. Fortunately, one brand found a solution. They offer comfortable, fairly priced jeans in four styles of fabric weights and stretch factors, and they come in a shade of dark blue that is versatile enough to be worn at a variety of occasions.
$14.5 billion takeover offer
American jewelry company Tiffany & Co. has received an all-cash takeover offer from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton of approximately $120 per share, valuing the business famous for its blue boxes at nearly $14.5 billion. The acquisition would help the French company further expand its portfolio of upscale brands and increase its exposure to luxury jewelry through more than 300 stores worldwide and Tiffany’s $4 billion in annual revenue. [The Wall Street Journal]
77 percent of undergraduates
Just like in the United States, most university students in Iceland are now women, but the gender difference in the northern European country is especially pronounced at schools like the University of Akureyri, where 77 percent of the undergraduates are women. Icelandic women are also earning more graduate degrees, and the ratio of college completion outside of the capital city of Reykjavik is 40 percent women to 19 percent men. [Washington Post]
39.7 percent of news clips
In late September, FiveThirtyEight’s Dhrumil Mehta looked at data from the TV News Archive finding that former Vice President Joe Biden dominated the coverage in cable news clips (74 percent) and online news stories more than every other 2020 Democratic candidate combined. However, after the initial flood of coverage on President Trump’s call to Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden subsided, the attention on Biden fell, especially in cable news clips, to only 39.7 percent of clips. Meanwhile, mentions of Hawaiian Rep. Tulsi Gabbard significantly rose after former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton suggested Gabbard “was being groomed by the Russians for a third-party run to undermine Democrats’ chances in 2020.” [FiveThirtyEight]
10,000 structures under evacuation order
On Monday, more than 600 acres and approximately 10,000 structures have been placed under mandatory evacuation orders due to a brush fire that quickly travelled through communities and burned homes on the west side of Los Angeles. The Getty fire has already destroyed at least eight homes and travelled so quickly Mayor Eric Garcetti said some residents only had 15 minutes to flee from the flames. “Get out when we say get out,” he said. [Los Angeles Times]
January 31, 2020
The very thing Prime Minister Boris Johnson didn’t want has occurred — the United Kingdom has once again delayed, until Jan. 31, 2020, its departure from the European Union. Lawmakers rejected Johnson’s call to hold an early election on Dec. 12 after failing to get the two-thirds majority of votes in the House of Commons. Johnson said he would try a different tactic during the “flextension” later this week through a bill, which only requires a simple majority to pass. [Associated Press]

And although there are some signs of the party breaking with Trump, one important reason why we haven’t seen GOP senators break with Trump en masse is because many are up for reelection — in total, there are 23 Republican-held seats up in 2020.
And in five of these races, Republicans face particularly tough reelection battles. Election forecasters have rated these races as the most competitive Senate contests in the 2020 cycle, and in each race, the partisan lean of their states is less than 10 points more Republican than the country as a whole. In fact, in the case of Maine and Colorado, they actually lean slightly Democratic.1 These senators are especially vulnerable in a general election if Trump’s standing declines, but they’re also in a position where they can’t afford to alienate their party’s base.

So a vote on whether to remove Trump from office could really complicate things for them, especially if the current timeline for a vote on impeachment holds. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell anticipates the House will vote by the end of the year, which means the Senate could vote in January or February, before the filing deadlines to mount a bid in most of these races have passed. This means many of these Republicans could find themselves facing a last-minute primary challenger if they voted to remove, making the electoral calculus of casting such a vote even more fraught with peril.
Granted, coming up with any scenario where 20 Republican senators vote to remove Trump from office — the minimum needed if all 47 Democrats voted in favor — is challenging to begin with, but it’s even harder if Sens. Susan Collins, Joni Ernst, Cory Gardner, Martha McSally and Thom Tillis are off the table because they fear a primary challenger.
And the threat of a primary challenger is a real concern. In fact, both McSally and Tillis already have one. Although the other three don’t currently have challengers, Collins could be especially vulnerable if she breaks with Trump — she’s the most moderate Republican in the Senate and has had lukewarm intraparty support in the past, though it improved markedly after she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court last year. On the other hand, Gardner and Ernst have voted with Trump much more consistently than Collins, but a pro-removal vote would likely still tarnish them in the eyes of the party’s base.
To be sure, we don’t know how the impeachment saga will unfold, but the electoral ramifications on the GOP side are something to keep in mind. That’s because even if there is some movement in a pro-impeachment direction among Republican voters, there may still be some senators up in 2020 who fear the potential dangers of angering the party base and getting a serious primary challenge.

In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew tries to answer that question in a new edition of FiveThirtyEight Debate. Each member of the team was assigned a position and then tried to poke holes in each other’s cases. The best argument wins — or at least gets some muted respect.
Also, President Trump announced on Sunday that the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, died during a U.S. military raid in Syria. The team discusses the political implications of his death.
Finally, the crew asks why there appears to be so much disagreement in national Democratic primary polls.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-are-moving-quickly-with-impeachment/,2019-10-29,,,features,"Oct. 29, 2019",Why Democrats Are Moving Quickly With Impeachment,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,FiveThirtyEight,Impeachment,"House Democrats are running out of time. With a little over three months to go before the beginning of primary season, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Monday that the House will hold its first formal vote of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump on Thursday, signaling that the investigation, which has taken place almost entirely behind closed doors so far, is about to go public. This is an important step in expediting the proceedings, especially if Democrats are trying to avoid an impeachment process that stretches into an election year. But it’s also a sign that even after a judge ruled that their investigation was legal, Democrats aren’t waiting on the courts to help bolster their inquiry.
This might seem like an odd capitulation, considering the courts could help Democrats obtain testimony from witnesses who have thus far refused to cooperate, including a former White House official who recently asked a judge to weigh in on whether he needs to comply with a House subpoena. And several experts told me that Trump’s claims of immunity for his aides are something of a stretch legally. But relying on the courts is also not without its risks, because reaching a final decision could take months, and even then their testimony wouldn’t be guaranteed. So Democrats may be gambling that it’s worth leaving some stones unturned to keep the impeachment process from stretching into an election year, at which point Republicans might be able to make the argument more successfully that the voters should decide Trump’s fate.
And Democrats are on a very tight timeline. Behind-the-scenes testimony is currently scheduled to stretch into November, which means even with the floor vote scheduled for this week, it’s difficult to imagine any scenario in which Democrats will be able to vote on impeachment by Thanksgiving, as some lawmakers originally suggested. Public hearings, which will include highlights from the private testimony, could happen soon, but could also last several weeks, depending on the number of witnesses who are called to testify.
Then once the hearings are over, members of the Judiciary Committee would still have to write (and approve) the articles of impeachment, before sending them to the House for a full vote. Some lawmakers are now suggesting the full vote could happen by Christmas, but even after all that, only one stage of the impeachment process would be over. And provided the House did vote to impeach, Trump’s trial in the Senate would likely not begin until January 2020. It’s hard to know exactly how long the trial would last, but President Bill Clinton’s, for example, lasted roughly five weeks.
The tradeoff of moving to act quickly without hearing from the courts is that Democrats may now be unable to hear from key figures like John Bolton, the former national security advisor who reportedly called the president’s efforts to pressure Ukraine a “drug deal,” or Rudy Giuliani, who appears to have been pulling the strings behind the shadow campaign to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. But some Democrats say they already have several pieces of “smoking gun” evidence against Trump, including the whistleblower report that triggered the inquiry and recent testimony from senior Ukraine envoy William Taylor, who suggested that aid to Ukraine hinged on their willingness to investigate the Bidens.
The possibility of getting Trump’s inner circle on the record may still hold special allure, since Bolton and others could provide decisive, firsthand testimony about whether Trump explicitly tied an investigation into Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, to military aid. However, this last wall of Trump’s defenses could prove particularly difficult to break without a prolonged legal fight. Giuliani has already defied a House subpoena to testify, and Bolton may also refuse to appear until a judge weighs in about whether the Trump administration’s expansive claims of immunity for presidential aides are legitimate. Steven Schwinn, a constitutional law professor at John Marshall Law School, said that claiming all high-level aides are off-limits to Congress is something of a wild legal argument. “That’s just not something the courts have ever come close to saying,” he said. He added, though, that although a ruling from the courts could end the stalemate, it probably wouldn’t be on Democrats’ preferred timeline. “It’s part of the Trump administration’s broader foot-dragging policy to try to run out the clock on cases where they’re just refusing to work with Congress,” he said.
But let’s say for the sake of argument that the case did move through the courts at the legal equivalent of light speed, delivering a final ruling within a month or two. Even if Democrats won, they’d be rewarded with a whole new array of witnesses to interview and documents to sift through — which could boost their case, but would also be time-consuming. “A win for the Democrats would probably mean months of back-and-forth in the courts, but then it wouldn’t be over — they’d have to deal with a flood of new testimony,” said Philip Bobbitt, a law professor at the Columbia University and the author of “Impeachment: A Handbook.”
Weighing these options, it’s easy to see why Democratic leadership might have concluded that the perfect is the enemy of the good, and decided to move ahead with public hearings based on the testimony they already have. It certainly is simpler in some ways for Democrats. They avoid getting caught up in a complex legal battle with the Trump administration, and present the information they’ve already gathered on their own terms. But the White House’s stonewalling may also have forced their hand because on a practical level, this is pretty much the only way to ensure that impeachment doesn’t spill over into primary season. Democrats seem to think the information they’ve already gathered is damning enough to present to the American people without pressing for further testimony — and we’ll soon see whether the public will find their case convincing.

After the San Francisco 49ers selected the Ohio State defensive end second overall in the 2019 NFL Draft, their defense has gone from being a laughingstock to making a joke out of enemy offenses. Bosa is tied for seventh in the NFL in sacks despite playing much of the year on a bum ankle — and despite San Francisco having played one fewer game than more than half the teams in the league. In Sunday’s 51-13 win over the Carolina Panthers, Bosa became the first player in franchise history to have three sacks and an interception in the same game.
Teammate Richard Sherman said Bosa should be considered not just for the Rookie of the Year Award but also as the overall Defensive Player of the Year. Only one rookie in history has been named the defensive MVP: Lawrence Taylor of the 1981 New York Giants.1
When you’re being compared to rookie Lawrence Taylor, that’s saying a lot. Here’s how Taylor was described his rookie year:
“I’ve seen the movies Superman I and Superman II; now I’m seeing Superman III in person.”2
“The best rookie I’ve ever seen at any position.”3
“I’m afraid to have him play against my team.”4
And here are Bosa’s reviews after Sunday’s performance:
“He’s everything you can ask for.”5
“I’m really happy he’s on my team because I don’t want to block him.”6
“He’s a freak.”7
Does Bosa deserve to be compared to a player who is widely recognized as the best defensive player in league history? If you look at the overall improvement made by their respective defenses after each player’s arrival, the answer is yes.8

After adding Taylor, the Giants defense improved from 27th in opposing points per game to third. Bosa’s Niners have gone from 28th to second. The Giants moved up 21 spots in yards allowed per game compared with 12 spots for the Niners. In net yards allowed per pass attempt, which factors in yards lost to sacks, the 1981 Giants jumped 24 spots compared with 11 by this year’s Niners. In terms of opposing passer rating, Bosa’s Niners have improved considerably more than Taylor’s Giants, up 29 spots to the Giants’ 10.
We can’t compare respective sacks because they were not officially counted in 1981. (They became an official stat the following season.) But so far this year, the Niners’ defense has the highest rate of sacks per dropbacks (which includes QB scrambles in addition to sacks as pass plays) since ESPN’s Stats & Information Group began tracking that stat in 2001. And its rate of 11.4 percent so far is nearly double last year’s rate, without Bosa (6.2 percent).
So is the case for Bosa closed? Well, not exactly. When you get down to the individual level, Bosa’s performance in rushing the passer, beyond the sacks, is merely good and not outstanding. In terms of Pass Rush Win Rate — the rate that the pass rusher wins his battles with pass blocker(s) — Bosa ranks 24th at 19 percent. But that’s the highest rate on the team.
San Francisco’s defense is setting sack records despite blitzing on just 14.8 percent of dropbacks, the second-lowest rate in the league. And that’s down from 20.3 percent last year, when the Niners’ overall sack rate was just 11th in the league. This juxtaposition of a relatively rare yet effective blitz has enabled Niners defensive coordinator Robert Saleh to keep more defenders in coverage while also having a dominant pass rush. That combination has bedeviled quarterbacks, who are averaging 3.93 yards per dropback against the 49ers, which is also the top mark recorded by any defense since 2001.
Further, Bosa has only recently gotten completely healthy after that preseason ankle injury. In the four games where he’s not been listed on the injury report, he has six of his seven sacks, as well as nine of his 11 tackles for losses.
As we head into Halloween, and the second half of the season, here’s what’s really scary for San Francisco opponents: The best from Bosa may be still yet to come.

Although the Heisman Trophy is typically reserved for players who score touchdowns, rather than those who prevent them,1 Ohio State’s Chase Young has made a strong case for front-runner status.
“In a day and age when people get caught up in what’s next, he really wants to leave a legacy here,” Ohio State coach Ryan Day told Yahoo’s Pete Thamel. “That makes him special.”
That legacy will no doubt include last weekend, when Young turned a rain-soaked Saturday afternoon into his masterpiece. In the Buckeyes’s 38–7 dismantling of a Wisconsin program that has become Offensive Line U in recent years, Young tied a program record with four sacks,2 five tackles for loss and two forced fumbles. His position coach, Larry Johnson, told ESPN afterwards that it was the best single-game performance he’s ever seen. LeBron James — no stranger to being more physically imposing than his peers — called Young an “absolute monster.”

Young has 13.5 sacks on the season, 3.5 clear of anyone else in the country. The next time he registers one, it will set a new school record. He is second in the nation in forced fumbles with five. Among Power Five defenders, he’s tied for the national lead in tackles for loss (15.5), tied for second in disrupted dropbacks (14.5) and tied for third in defensive pressures (34).3 .
And while these box score metrics are noteworthy, they fail to encapsulate or appropriately contextualize his influence on a game, which is reminiscent of South Carolina’s Jadeveon Clowney and Nebraska’s Ndamukong Suh. Young’s versatility is critical to Ohio State’s success: Against Wisconsin, he lined up at linebacker, defended tight ends in coverage and was moved around on the line. He’s so fast that the Buckeyes don’t even need to blitz to turn a quarterback inside out: Only 11 Power Five teams have blitzed less than the Buckeyes, yet just Pittsburgh has accounted for more total sacks.
Armed with a freakish get-off that Day has called the best he’s ever seen and a mastery of Johnson’s “side-scissors” technique, Young is nearly impossible to block one-on-one. That frequently forces opposing coaches to dial up seven-man pass protections, which in turn has the Buckeyes secondary defending only three receivers. In a pass-heavy economy, that’s no small feat. “A complete game-changer,” is how co-defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley put it to The Athletic’s Bill Landis. “He allows us to do more in coverage.”

Ohio State is bludgeoning its opponents. The margin of victory in each of the team’s eight wins has been no smaller than 24 points, meaning that Young — perhaps in the interest of opposing quarterback safety — is removed from the field of play well before the score goes final. Among defensive linemen, Young is tied for 290th in defensive snaps, playing 261 total snaps this season. Just 17 of those snaps have come in the fourth quarter. His workload consists of little more than half of Ohio State’s total defensive snaps and just 15.5 percent of the Buckeyes’ fourth-quarter defensive snaps.
Heisman voters are mere human beings, biased by factors ranging from region to conference to position to race. Production is rarely contextualized,4 and the data with which these votes are cast is limited when it comes to defensive players. Sacks, tackles for loss and pressures — all of which Young has going for his candidacy — are only a fraction of on-field production and value.
But while imperfect, parsing Ohio State’s defensive splits with and without Young is instructive in identifying his value. While Ohio State allows a best-in-country 3.6 yards per play, with Young on the field, the Buckeyes allow 3.0 (the best mark through eight games since at least 2004), according to ESPN Stats & Information Group. Nearly half of all opponent plays gain zero or negative yardage when Young is on the field, a rate that drops 10.1 percentage points when he sits. Moreover, when Young is removed from the field, the Buckeyes pressure rate drops nearly 12 percentage points.
It is not enough to say Young is an unstoppable force. Mike Renner wrote recently that he’s doing things Pro Football Focus has never seen in its six years of tracking players. To watch Young bull-rush a quarterback is to watch an offensive line collectively drown. He’s too fast. He’s too strong. He’s too intelligent. His is the kind of impact that causes opposing QBs to, as Day put it, “start to feel ghosts and see ghosts.” Young was asked to replace Nick Bosa, the No. 2 pick in last year’s NFL draft. He responded by becoming the linchpin of a potent Ohio State defense and putting together perhaps the best Heisman candidacy by a defensive player we’ve seen in years.

Instead, the former vice president has his eyes on states No. 3 and 4 on the primary calendar — Nevada and South Carolina — plus the 14 states that will vote on Super Tuesday, just three days after the South Carolina primary.
The logic makes a certain amount of sense, too. Biden polls better than other candidates among black and Hispanic voters, so the states after nearly-all-white Iowa and New Hampshire definitely play to his strengths, as they’re far more diverse and representative of the Democratic Party. There’s just one problem: Since 1976, when the Iowa caucuses first became an influential part of the nomination process, the eventual Democratic nominee has almost always won either Iowa or New Hampshire (or both). In fact, there’s only one time this didn’t happen — Bill Clinton in 1992, and the circumstances were unusual.1
But maybe there’s a case to be made that Iowa and New Hampshire don’t matter as much for the Democrats as they once did. The states have never offered that many delegates, and their electorates don’t look much like the modern Democratic Party. Arguably, winning South Carolina’s black voters or clinching California on Super Tuesday could matter a lot more. Of course, it’s hard to argue that losing the first two states in the primary is a good strategy — and to be clear, the Biden campaign hasn’t argued they don’t want to win Iowa and New Hampshire, just that it’s not essential. So does the Biden camp have a point? Let’s go over the case for Iowa and New Hampshire mattering as much as they always have in the Democratic primary — and the case for their declining importance.
Case 1: Iowa and New Hampshire are as important as ever
Following reforms to the primary system in the 1970s and Jimmy Carter’s surprise victory in the 1976 Iowa caucuses, both Iowa and New Hampshire have become highly influential primary states, as they are the first two to vote (although there have been several unsuccessful efforts to change that).

Winning Iowa or New Hampshire will likely be critical for someone in the 2020 Democratic primary, too, especially if the same candidate wins both states. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is currently in the lead in both places, according to a FiveThirtyEight average of polls in Iowa and New Hampshire since the third Democratic debate in September — although she barely leads in Iowa. She has a narrow 1-point lead over Biden in Iowa and a 4-point edge in New Hampshire, according to our analysis. (RealClearPolitics’s average puts Warren roughly 3 points ahead of Biden in New Hampshire and less than a point behind Biden in Iowa.) But in both states, we’re only talking about a few points separating the top two candidates, so to be clear, the race is still incredibly tight.
And that’s important, because the margin by which a candidate wins Iowa or New Hampshire can have big consequences for the primary. A narrow defeat, for instance, wouldn’t necessarily spell doom for Biden’s campaign. Instead, it could give them an opportunity to spin the loss and talk about the relative lack of diversity in the first two states, said Josh Putnam, a political scientist and FiveThirtyEight contributor who tracks the nomination process. Putnam argued that a defeat by a wide margin would be harder to sell, and Caitlin Jewitt, a political scientist at Virginia Tech who studies presidential primaries, agreed. Jewitt stressed, however, that even a loss could be considered a good showing if the candidate lost by less than predicted. “It’s important to win in Iowa and New Hampshire,” said Jewitt. “But it’s almost more important to do better than you were expected to do.”
Winning or exceeding expectations in Iowa or New Hampshire seems to have a real effect on Democratic primaries, too — especially as it pertains to a candidate’s ability to attract national support. Take John Kerry in 2004. He was polling at about 8 percent nationally before Iowa, but after he won both Iowa and New Hampshire, his numbers went through the roof — a 37-point gain in the polls in a couple weeks — as he steamrolled to victory at the expense of opponents like Howard Dean. Similarly, in 2008, Barack Obama trailed the favorite, Hillary Clinton, by double digits in national polls, but after he won Iowa, he gained nearly 10 points in national support, even though Clinton recovered to win New Hampshire. Eventually, Obama won the lengthy nomination battle. And while Bernie Sanders didn’t win the Democratic nomination in 2016, his strong start in Iowa and New Hampshire helped force Clinton, once again the favorite, into a drawn-out race.

The bottom line is: Winning or at least outperforming expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire will likely still matter a lot in the Democratic race this year. As Jewitt told me, “If you do well [in Iowa or New Hampshire] … you get more media attention,” and this often means “a rise in the polls, and you get more fundraising.” And as we’ve seen in recent primaries, strong performances in these states can set a candidate up for success.
Case 2: Iowa and New Hampshire matter less and less
There is an argument to be made, however, that while they’re still pivotal for winnowing the field, neither Iowa nor New Hampshire is as critical as they have been historically for securing the Democratic nomination. The main reason being that Iowa and New Hampshire don’t look like the national Democratic Party and, therefore, might not be the best indicators of what the party wants. In 2016, the primary electorate in those two states was 91 percent white and 3 percent black while the national Democratic primary electorate was 66 percent white and 20 percent black.2 Whereas the 14 states that vote on Super Tuesday (March 3) look much more like the Democratic Party — 62 percent of these voters were white in 2016 while 18 percent were black.3 Many of these states also offer far more delegates than either Iowa or New Hampshire — California has the most Democratic delegates and will be voting on Super Tuesday next year, as will Texas, which has the second-most delegates.
And as we saw in the 2016 Democratic primary, Clinton was able to fight on despite underwhelming results in Iowa (where she narrowly won) and New Hampshire (where she lost). Granted, she had overwhelming support from the party establishment that Biden can’t currently match, but her position as the likely nominee was never really in doubt despite a poor showing in Iowa and New Hampshire. What 2016 suggests, then, is that as long as expectations aren’t set too high, somewhat underwhelming results in Iowa and New Hampshire are survivable. Putnam described the Biden campaign’s efforts to discount the importance of Iowa and New Hampshire as “a gamble,” but “one that might pay off” if the results are relatively close and South Carolina still looks favorable for him.
The media might also be more receptive to the idea that Iowa and New Hampshire aren’t representative of the Democratic Party, which may make them less important this year. Already there have been a number of stories about how the primary calendar — especially the Super Tuesday states — may shake up which states matter most to candidates. And as CNN analyst Ronald Brownstein wrote in February, the 14 states voting on March 3 “could advantage the candidates best positioned to appeal to minority voters, particularly African Americans.” So if Biden retains his solid support among African American voters and his campaign’s effort to lower expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire works, Biden might get what he wants — South Carolina and Super Tuesday as his real campaign tests.


Having now looked at the cases for and against Iowa and New Hampshire’s continued importance in the Democratic presidential primary, I do think it’s possible that these two states won’t matter as much. But I can’t help but suspect they’ll be as influential as ever. And that’s because even if the media is warier of the unrepresentative demographics of the first two states, it would still be tough for Biden to recover from dual losses at the beginning of the primary calendar. Remember, Bill Clinton is the only Democratic nominee since 1976 who lost both Iowa and New Hampshire. The winner(s) would likely get glowing coverage, too, while Biden would face more scrutiny. Defeat could also raise doubts among his supporters, given that “electability” is a central selling point of his campaign. And donors, with whom Biden is already struggling, might lose faith in him as well. So as long as Iowa and New Hampshire still get to go first, they’ll probably continue to have an outsized influence on the nomination process.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Less than half of the activists I interviewed in August, for instance, had settled on one person to support. But the tides at last seem to be turning in this round of interviews, with several activists now throwing their weight behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren, even though she’d struggled to lock down support in previous surveys.
This marks the sixth installment of my series with Democratic activists in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada and Washington, DC.,1 where I interview plugged-in early-state activists to better understand who they are rallying behind in 2020 as part of my upcoming book, which will look at changes in the Democratic Party between 2016 and 2020. And I’m checking back in with these activists every two months in order to learn which ones are committed to a candidate or, if they’re not committed to anyone, which candidates they are actively considering. I’ve also been asking them who they thought other Democrats in their community might be leaning toward and who they don’t want to see as the nominee.
And in this installment, we’ve reached something of a milestone: For the first time since I started conducting these interviews last December, a majority of respondents are now backing a candidate. Fifteen of the 29 people who answered my latest round of interviews claim to be backing a candidate now, up from 11 of 29 in August (although one activist changed who they were backing over the course of my interviews with them, switching from former Vice President Joe Biden to Warren). The most striking development, however, is that four of these activists now back Warren, while zero backed her in the last round. Warren is also the first female candidate who any activist in my sample has committed to support. One new Warren supporter told me that it was Warren’s policies that sealed the deal, adding that Warren’s performance at the debate in Houston, which the activist attended, “was especially influential.” Another said Warren “has the clearest message” and “the plans to back up that message.”
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also picked up another supporter, bringing his total backers up to two. “Pete can bridge the divide between left and right,” said his new backer. And even though he did not make the October debate stage, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet picked up his first backer as well, an activist who admires his “courageous, respectful approach to issues and discourse.” But my latest survey didn’t bring good news for everyone, as the one early-state activist who had been backing former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro has switched to undecided, saying they’re now concerned that Castro will drop out before voting begins in February.
But in addition to asking the early-state activists who they were committed to supporting, I also asked those who were uncommitted to tell me who they’re considering supporting.2 Here, we’ve also seen an important shift from August, when California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Biden, Warren and Buttigieg all had similar levels of support — roughly a third of activists were considering them. But now, Warren has clearly moved ahead of the other candidates, with 14 of 29 activists (48 percent) either supporting or considering her. Booker and Harris now trail her with 11 activists each (38 percent), and Biden and Buttigieg round out the top tier with nine activists apiece (31 percent). (In the table below, I combined the number of respondents considering each candidate with the number committed to each candidate to show their total support.)

The October results are based on interviews with 29 Democratic activists who were asked about the 19 candidates listed above. Number of activists who responded varies in previous rounds of interviews.
Source: SETH MASKET, “LEARNING FROM LOSS: THE DEMOCRATS, 2016-2020”
As for the candidates the activists do not want to see become the nominee, the rankings haven’t changed much since August, but the commitment has intensified somewhat. Twenty-three of 29 activists (79 percent) do not want to see spiritual author Marianne Williamson become the nominee (up from 55 percent last time), and 21 of 29 (72 percent) feel the same about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (up from 62 percent). Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders remains about as disliked as he was in the last round of interviews; 62 percent (18 of 29 activists) now oppose him for the nomination, essentially unchanged from 59 percent in the last round. (It’s unclear if Sanders’s heart attack had any effect on activists’ feelings — he was in the hospital and had “pushed pause” on his campaign during the time people were responding to my questions, but no one mentioned the incident in the open comment section of the survey.) Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam (20 of 29 activists, 69 percent), and former Reps. John Delaney and Joe Sestak (18 activists each, 62 percent) round out the most-disliked category, with hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer (16 activists, 55 percent) not far behind.
In my last installment, I also started reporting which candidate activists think Democrats active in their communities lean toward, regardless of their own preferences, and Warren has continued her upward trajectory here as well. In August, nine of 27 activists (33 percent) said they thought people in their community were leaning toward Warren. This month, 14 of 29 (48 percent) now believe their community is leaning toward her; the next closest candidate was Biden with three of 29 (10 percent). Only eight of 29 activists (28 percent) think people in their community haven’t made up their mind.
Judging from this round of interviews, it appears that Warren has gained an important toehold in the Democratic activist community and is emerging as the front-runner. This has tracked with her rise in the polls, though, notably, activists’ preferences haven’t really preceded her rise. After all, it took until this month for any activist to tell me they were committed to supporting Warren. It seems as if the activists I’m reinterviewing are largely in step with public opinion, suggesting to me a party that is hesitant to pick a winner ahead of the party’s voters.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

1.5 million packages a day
There’s a price for all those smiling boxes on your doorstep. The popularity of Amazon Prime and other e-commerce vendors has resulted in more gridlock, congestion, parking violations, as well as pollution in New York City due to increases in truck traffic. Matthew Haag and Winnie Hu of The New York Times report that more than 1.5 million packages are being delivered each day, with households now receiving more shipments than businesses, and the situation could get worse with Amazon’s Prime delivery service changing to one day instead of two. [New York Times]
96 miles per hour winds
Historic winds hit Northern California on Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service recording speeds of 96 miles per hour not far from an area directly threatened by the massive Kincade fire, which has spread to more than 30,000 acres. Extreme wind speeds of 50 mph along with low-humidity air can significantly worsen fire conditions by further drying out vegetation on the ground. National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Anderson told the LA Times that wind gusts in the 70 mph range were expected to continue through Sunday and into Monday. [Los Angeles Times]
62 percent off the selling price
Bruce Makowsky’s Los Angeles super-mansion has its own crocodile skin-clad elevator, but after three years of being on the market, the $250 million house finally found a buyer only after its price fell by 62 percent. The Wall Street Journal reports Makowsky wasn’t alone in his price reduction due to a high oversupply of “extremely expensive” luxury homes featuring amenities like a bowling alley, movie theater, art installations, and a helipad. Makowsky became a billionaire through sales of affordable leather bags on QVC, the home shopping channel. [Wall Street Journal]
1st African American face transplant recipient
There have been fewer than 50 face transplants completed worldwide, but when Robert Chelsea saw the first face he was offered, he turned it down because it belonged to a man with skin much fairer than his own. After more than another year of waiting for a new donor, Chelsea became the first African American recipient of a full face transplant after a catastrophic car accident with a drunk driver five years covered most of his body in third-degree burns. Medical professionals hope the 68-year-old man’s story could encourage more black Americans, and their family members, to become organ donors, which would save lives and help reducing wait times. [TIME]
$334,000 for an unwashed cardigan
It doesn’t smell like teen spirit, but Kurt Cobain’s stained, cigarette-burned cardigan was still worth a lot of money after it sold at auction in New York on Saturday for $334,000. The green, unwashed garment became famous in 1993 after Cobain wore it during a MTV “Unplugged” performance with his band Nirvana. Cobain’s custom-made Fender Mustang guitar was also on sale and sold for $340,000. [BBC News]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-warriors-werent-supposed-to-be-this-bad/,2019-10-28,,,features,"Oct. 28, 2019",The Warriors Weren’t Supposed To Be This Bad,Chris Herring,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"Coming into this season, it was a pretty widely accepted notion that the Golden State Warriors wouldn’t win another title in 2020. After losing Kevin Durant in free agency and Splash Brother Klay Thompson in the NBA Finals to an ACL tear, things were never going to be the same.
But even if you didn’t think a championship was in the offing, you probably didn’t expect this.
This, of course, being two blowout losses to start the season, with the Warriors yet to even hold a lead thus far. The first loss — to the Los Angeles Clippers — was embarrassing, but maybe understandable: Even without Paul George, the Clippers have perhaps the world’s best player on their roster. But the second defeat, a 28-point loss to a new-look Thunder team that had lost its first two games, was alarming.
The supporting cast has been the problem. With six players on the roster who are either in their first or second NBA season, there simply isn’t enough depth around Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and D’Angelo Russell to warrant much faith right now. Warriors coach Steve Kerr once had the luxury of resting his all-stars all at once, since Golden State could chop deficits like a set of late-night infomerical steak knives. But without Thompson as a perpetual-motion off-ball threat, this offense clearly doesn’t have the same kind of firepower.
We wrote during the offseason that the Warriors, as we knew them, were long gone; much of what quietly made Golden State special — the team’s incredible, switch-everything defense, for example — was no longer on the roster. And indeed, the Warriors have the NBA’s worst defense by far to start the season, allowing opponents to shoot almost 88 percent from inside of 3 feet through two games.
The offense has been awful, too, with the NBA’s worst effective field goal percentage. But, as Curry wisely pointed out, it’s especially hard to play offense when every play has to begin with an inbound pass following a failed effort on defense. According to Inpredictable, a whopping 62 percent of the Warriors’ possessions have started after the opponent has scored, the highest rate in the league.
This isn’t to suggest that things won’t improve at some point. Curry is still the best shooter on the planet, and there will undoubtedly be nights when his scoring will be enough for the Warriors to win. Russell may be able to do the same from time to time. And once he gets back in the lineup, center Kevon Looney’s experience will provide a huge boost on defense.
FiveThirtyEight’s NBA predictions still give Golden State a 68 percent chance to make the playoffs. But with how bad things looked during this first week, it may be time for most of us to reevaluate our expectations for the Warriors. They certainly aren’t championship-caliber, and they may not even be playoff-caliber.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-phoenix-suns-are-hot-and-they-dont-look-like-a-fluke/,2019-10-28,,,features,"Oct. 28, 2019","The Phoenix Suns Are Hot, And They Don’t Look Like A Fluke",Chris Herring,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"The Phoenix Suns are … the team to beat in the Western Conference?
OK, so I didn’t make much of Phoenix’s opening-night blowout win over the Sacramento Kings, necessarily. But I was impressed with the Suns taking a solid Denver Nuggets team to overtime on the road, and losing by a single point. And it was stunning to see them take down Kawhi Leonard and the Los Angeles Clippers the following night. After that three-game stretch the Suns are tied atop the Pacific Division — yes, the one with the Clippers, L.A. Lakers and Golden State Warriors — and own the NBA’s best point differential heading into Monday night’s games. And the FiveThirtyEight NBA prediction model has Phoenix at 24 percent to make the playoffs, up 4 percentage points from the final preseason predictions.
But arguably even more important than the victories themselves is how Phoenix has played. There are some key differences — some obvious, some not so much — between this team and the previous team, which went just 19-63. The Suns have only played three games, but it’s already clear they are no longer a symbol of the increasingly small group of hapless clubs left in the once-tanktastic NBA.
So how did Phoenix start to turn things around? Some of it was basic roster improvement. The Suns have a desperately needed starting point guard in Ricky Rubio, who has helped improve the team’s ball movement. Case in point: The team, which ranked 17th in assist percentage1 last season, currently leads the NBA in the metric, at nearly 70 percent.
Beyond that, the team’s offense appears to be far more dynamic. Players like the bouncy Kelly Oubre Jr. are hunting back-door cuts more frequently, particularly when star scorer Devin Booker attracts considerable defensive attention that momentarily leaves a teammate open. (Booker is averaging 8.3 assists per game, up from 6.8 dimes a contest last season.) Consider that almost 10 percent of the Suns’ possessions involve a cut, according to Synergy Sports — the second-highest rate in the NBA. That represents a night-and-day difference from last season, when Phoenix was tied for 19th in the same category.
Using an array of screens and cuts makes a ton of sense given the Suns’ roster. Rubio often snakes his way through the paint, sometimes confusing defenders, who become distracted and sometimes lose sight of another player cutting toward the rim. And Aron Baynes, the starting center now that Deandre Ayton is suspended, is one of the NBA’s more rugged screeners, creating space for the likes of Booker and Dario Šarić, who have the jumpers to take full advantage.

Of course several things could unravel the nice start. Ayton’s suspension2 was a blow, as he has far more athleticism and scoring ability down low than the other bigs on the roster. He’d also shown some encouraging signs on defense in the opener, in which he logged four blocks. Rubio’s shooting has long been suspect, so opposing defenses will likely dare him to shoot because of it, hurting the other four players’ spacing. If teams play Rubio off the floor, and the offense becomes less fluid, it potentially asks Booker to do too much on his own.
But after so many years of awful basketball, and goats metaphorically defecating in their offices, the Suns and their fans should enjoy being on top of the Pacific standings for however long the adventure lasts.

Biden was mentioned in more cable news clips and online news stories that week than every other 2020 Democratic candidate combined, according to data from the TV News Archive, which chops up cable news across the three networks we monitor — CNN, MSNBC and Fox News — into 15-second clips1 and Media Cloud, a database of online news.2. That week, Biden was mentioned in 74 percent of cable news clips, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the next most-mentioned candidate, was only in 16 percent of clips.
In the past two weeks, however, as the initial flood of impeachment coverage has ebbed, so has the extra attention for Biden.
Last week, almost all candidates were mentioned in a smaller share of cable news clips and online news stories, per a query run early Monday afternoon. That’s likely because of the Oct. 15 primary debate — we’ve noticed that the share of coverage for candidates who participated in debates in the past seemed to go up on debate week and down the week after, just as we see in the table below.

Includes all candidates that qualify as “major” in FiveThirtyEight’s rubric. Each network’s daily news coverage is chopped up into 15-second clips, and each clip that includes a candidate’s name is counted as one mention. For both cable and online news, our search queries look for an exact match for each candidate’s name, except for Julián Castro, for whom our search query is “Julian Castro” OR “Julián Castro.” Media Cloud searches use two of the database’s publication lists: “top online news” and “digital native” publications. Percentages are calculated as the number of stories or clips mentioning each candidate divided by the number of stories or clips mentioning any of the 2020 Democratic contenders for that week.

While most candidates who participated in the October debate got fewer mentions last week compared to the prior week (the week of the debate), there was one notable exception. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard was mentioned in almost twice as many cable news clips this week compared to last. Much of the cable news attention came when former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton suggested that Gabbard was being groomed by the Russians for a third-party run to undermine Democrats’ chances in 2020. In fact, the most common words mentioned in 15-second clips mentioning Gabbard were “Hillary,” “Clinton,” “Russian” and “asset.”
But Gabbard didn’t get the same amount of attention across networks last week. She was mentioned in 66 clips on CNN and 71 clips on MSNBC, but 339 clips (almost five times as many) on Fox News.

14 percent
Analysis from sportswriters Josh Planos and Neil Paine shows that tight ends on college football teams are increasing their share of receptions and receiving yards, and have completed 14.3 percent of passing first downs this college football season. The position has evolved from what was essentially a lineman to a versatile, dynamic athlete. “The new tight ends run routes like wide receivers do and prey on the linebackers who are often assigned to defend them,” say Planos and Paine.

40 million pounds of pork
A glut of pigs and pork output over the summer has led to a record amount of bacon sitting in warehouses. U.S. government data shows more than 40 million pounds of pork bellies were in cooled storage as of Sept. 30, the most for the month in 48 years. U.S. producers were anticipating additional demand from China after millions of pigs in the Asian country were killed due to African swine fever, but trade tensions between the U.S. and China lowered demand. Now producers are left trying to figure out how to cut the fat. [Bloomberg]
10 to 15 miles per hour
Twenty-five cyclists have been killed in New York City so far this year, 15 more than in all of 2018, and a 20-year record. Following redesigns of intersections and more protected bike lanes, the city’s transportation department is now experimenting with traffic signals to further slow down cars and prioritize the flow of cyclists. The New York Times reports that city changes will mean cyclists traveling an average of 10 to 15 mph can “catch a wave of green lights” on certain streets, while drivers who go over 15 mph will see red lights. [New York Times]
8,969 detained immigrants
New data shows 8,969 immigrant detainees have passed a government test that demonstrates they have valid fears of persecution or torture if deported back to their home countries. Passing this is the first step in a lengthy process to gain protections in the U.S., and in the past many immigrants who passed the test would be allowed to live more freely in the U.S. while their asylum claim was processed. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is funded to house approximately 42,000 immigrant detainees, but has severely exceeded the capacity of its facilities with more than 55,530 inmates as of Aug. 10. [BuzzFeed News]
100 elephant deaths
Government officials in Botswana say preliminary investigations show a suspected anthrax outbreak is one of the main causes behind more than 100 elephant deaths in the past two months. Below-average rainfall led to severe drought in the region, resulting in elephants digging up the soil containing the anthrax bacteria spore. Elephants Without Borders said 14 elephants were found dead this week and the bodies would be burned to prevent further spread of the anthrax infection. [Africanews]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/vegas-thinks-the-nba-title-race-is-as-wide-open-as-its-been-in-a-long-time/,2019-10-25,,,features,"Oct. 25, 2019",Vegas Thinks The NBA Title Race Is As Wide Open As It’s Been In A Long Time,Greg Guglielmo,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"When the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook’s 2019-20 NBA championship odds first opened back in May, the Golden State Warriors were the early favorites to win this season’s title. At +175,1 the Warriors’ odds implied a 36 percent chance2 to win the championship — pretty high in absolute terms, but low relative to recent Warriors odds, as it priced in some uncertainty around whether Kevin Durant would re-sign with the team. That same uncertainty had the New York Knicks optimistically tied for the sixth-best title odds in the league (+1600), as the Knicks harbored hopes of drafting Zion Williamson and signing Durant and Kyrie Irving.
A lot has changed in the NBA since then. The Warriors lost Klay Thompson to a torn ACL and Durant to an Achilles injury before Durant signed with the Brooklyn Nets. Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and Paul George became Los Angeles Clippers; Anthony Davis became a Los Angeles Laker; Russell Westbrook became a Houston Rocket; and LeBron James crept closer to age 35.3 And true to form, the Knicks missed out on the top pick in the NBA draft, whiffed on marquee player acquisitions and saw their title odds fall to +100,000, tied for worst in the league.
When the NBA’s star carousel finally slowed, the top of the league felt about as balanced as it had in recent years. Heading into Tuesday night’s season openers, the Clippers were favored to win it all (+350, good for an implied probability of 22 percent), followed by the Lakers (+400, 20 percent), Milwaukee Bucks (+600, 14 percent), Rockets and Philadelphia 76ers (+800, 11 percent), Warriors (+1200, 8 percent), Utah Jazz and Denver Nuggets (+1600, 6 percent) and Boston Celtics (+2500, 4 percent).4
So how balanced are these teams’ odds in the context of recent NBA history? For starters, the Kawhi-led Clippers are, in odds terms, the NBA’s weakest preseason favorite since the waning months of the George W. Bush administration, or late 2008. In basketball parlance, by then LeBron had already started four All-Star Games; Zion had just started third grade. In any case, Tuesday’s tipoff marked the first time since the start of the 2008-09 season that the NBA’s preseason favorite had championship odds worse than +300.5 Put another way, this is the first time in 11 years in which no NBA team entered the season with an odds-implied probability of at least 25 percent to win it all.
As Vegas odds go, only three of the past 35 NBA seasons6 have featured a weaker preseason favorite than this year’s Clippers: 2007-08 (Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs, +450), 2006-07 (Mavericks, +400) and 2004-05 (Spurs, +400). All three of those seasons happened to come in the four-year period between the end of the Shaquille O’Neal-Kobe Bryant era and the beginning of the Pau Gasol-Bryant pairing in L.A.7 The Spurs won two titles in that span (and three in five years), but Vegas frequently underestimated them along the way, and San Antonio never owned the top of the odds board as other dynasties have.

Exact odds vary by date and sportsbook. The 1998-99 and 2011-12 seasons were shortened by lockouts.
*Seasons with co-favorites

Despite the team’s low-for-a-favorite odds, Clippers fans would be happy to learn that in the 35 NBA seasons since 1984-85, the preseason favorite or co-favorite made the NBA Finals 27 times and won 18 championships. During the same 35-season period in the NFL, by contrast, only seven preseason favorites or co-favorites won the Super Bowl. The NBA’s +350 favorites don’t win the Finals with the same frequency as NBA favorites in general — only three of seven have made the Finals, and only two have won — but thanks to a handful of somewhat unexpected NBA champions,8 +350 actually represents the median preseason title odds for all NBA champions since 1984-85.9
Beyond the Clippers, the preseason parity of 2019-20 also harkens back to the mid-to-late 2000s. Five of this year’s NBA teams — the Clippers, Lakers, Bucks, Rockets and Sixers — came into the season with odds-implied probabilities to win the NBA championship between 10 percent and 24.99 percent, the most such teams since 2006-07. Eight teams — the five mentioned plus the Warriors, Jazz and Nuggets — carried odds-implied probabilities of 5 percent to 24.99 percent, the most since 2008-09. This stands in contrast to the past 10 years, when championship odds were concentrated in one or two teams per season — usually the Warriors, Cavaliers, Heat or Lakers — and then dwindled from there.
Whether you think there’s value in this year’s NBA odds ultimately comes down to whether you believe any teams have a greater probability to win the championship than the betting markets imply. These perceptions naturally vary between fans, pundits and computer models. FiveThirtyEight’s predictions, powered by the new RAPTOR player ratings, agree with Vegas about which nine teams had the highest preseason probability of winning the NBA Finals. But relative to the oddsmakers, RAPTOR is more bullish on the Rockets and bearish on the Lakers.
FiveThirtyEight’s model estimated that the Rockets entered the season with a 28 percent chance to win it all — best in the league and considerably higher than the 11 percent chance implied by their +800 Vegas odds. By that logic, the Rockets should have priced closer to +255 or +260. Meanwhile, our final preseason forecast gave the Lakers just a 3 percent chance of winning the Finals, seventh-best in the league and a fraction of the 20 percent probability implied by LeBron and Co.’s +400 odds. A 3 percent chance at the Larry O’Brien Trophy suggests that the Lakers’ odds should have been more like +3200.
In the end, this new era of NBA player movement makes the already difficult exercise of basketball prognostication even more challenging. Oddsmakers, computer models and casual bettors need to consider not only the teams today but also potential in-season trades — and which teams have the gumption and chips to pull them off. Here’s to an exciting 2019-20 NBA season, both on and off the floor.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-is-the-patriots-defense-so-damn-good/,2019-10-25,,,features,"Oct. 25, 2019",Why Is The Patriots’ Defense So Damn Good?,Josh Hermsmeyer,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"Through seven games, the New England Patriots remain undefeated — and they appear unstoppable. No longer a team defined by the play of quarterback Tom Brady, New England is fielding one of the most dominant defenses in NFL history. The 48 total points allowed by New England heading into Week 8 are the lowest since the AFL-NFL merger and the second-lowest on record, trailing only the Otto Graham-led 1946 Cleveland Browns.1 The Patriots’ score differential of 175 points is the best all time through seven games, and perhaps because of that, our Elo forecasts have New England as a virtual lock to make the playoffs. History agrees: No team since the 1948 San Francisco 49ers has started a season 7-0 and missed the playoffs.
The defensive dominance starts up front in New England. The Patriots have been aggressive rushing the passer, ranking seventh in the league in blitzes (82) and first in defensive EPA on those plays (30.2). The high EPA total is due in large part to the Patriots’ league-leading five interceptions off the blitz — but it’s not just a few lucky interceptions boosting their numbers. New England has been consistently good when blitzing, gaining positive EPA on 70.7 percent of their blitzes, 17 percentage points over the league average. Overall, New England is second in the league in sacks (26) this season.
Perhaps the Patriots’ Achilles’ heel on defense is that — despite their gaudy sack totals — they’re actually below average at pressuring the opposing quarterback. According to ESPN Analytics’ Pass Rush Win Rate metric, the Patriots are in the bottom third of the league (24th) in generating pressure.2 And despite their early-season dominance, this could end up being a problem for the Pats as their schedule gets harder in the second half of the season. While hand-wringing about seemingly small defensive flaws in the face of New England’s historic performance might seem misplaced — no dip in performance will likely be large enough to keep them out of the postseason — the lack of pressure is still notable.
Pressuring the quarterback and effective pass coverage are interconnected. It’s probably unsurprising that when quarterbacks aren’t pressured, their passes are worth significantly more than the throws they attempt when under pressure. What’s more interesting is why those unpressured passes are more valuable.
It turns out that the pass attempts that really end up hurting a defense are the deep shots taken by an offense when its quarterback has time in the pocket. Throws with target depths of 20 air yards or more are significantly more valuable3 than those thrown short (from 1-to-10 yards), and unpressured quarterbacks with time in the pocket tend to attempt more of them. The Patriots have a low Pass Rush Win Rate, so we might expect them to have seen quite a few deep passes attempted against them this year — and that’s just what we find. No other team has had more passes of 20-plus yards thrown against them this season.4

Deep passes are pass attempts that travel 20 yards in the air.
Source: ESPN Stats & Information Group
Attempted passes aren’t completed passes, of course, and the Patriots have been incredible at defending the deep ball all year long. Of the 12 defenses that have seen 30 or more deep pass attempts against them, the Patriots’ secondary is the one defensive unit with a positive EPA. Not only is New England allowing just 4.3 yards per play on passes of 20 yards or more, 37 of the 42 deep passes attempted against the Patriots’ secondary ended up as negative EPA plays for the opposing offense. As a percentage of those plays, only the San Francisco 49ers have performed better against the deep ball through Week 7. And according to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats, teams are completing passes 24 percentage points below what we’d expect against the Patriots on deep passes.
Can New England keep up this blistering pace? We know that defensive performance is unpredictable, and that fortunes can change quickly in the NFL. The Pats will go from facing Ryan Fitzpatrick/Josh Rosen, Luke Falk, Josh Allen/Matt Barkley, Colt McCoy, Daniel Jones and Sam Darnold over the past six weeks to Baker Mayfield, Lamar Jackson, Carson Wentz, Dak Prescott, Deshaun Watson and perhaps Patrick Mahomes in the next six games. Given their upcoming opponents, it’s probably inevitable that New England’s current defensive performance will come back down to earth. But if the Patriots can improve their pressure on the quarterback, denying some of the league’s best signal-callers a clean pocket from which to attack them deep, their chances of continuing to defy gravity might improve substantially.

That’s Not Necessarily Bad For The Party.",Julia Azari,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Back in 2016, I wrote that Sen. Bernie Sanders shouldn’t drop out of the Democratic primary to help Hillary Clinton. That’s because, contrary to conventional wisdom, there’s no consensus on whether a long, divisive primary contest hurts a party in the general election.
In 2019, with more than a dozen candidates still in the running, Democrats are confronting another iteration of this question. The field has narrowed in the last few months, but there are still several potential front-runners, not to mention a bumper crop of second- and third-tier candidates. This means that even though many voters are still undecided, many of them likely won’t see their first-choice candidate — or maybe even their second pick — become the nominee.
What are the implications of this for the party? Well, the reality is we don’t have a lot of examples of presidential primaries with fields this large. But as Hans Noel, an author of “The Party Decides,” wrote in 2016, the parties want a candidate who appeals to all their factions, not just some of them. This was one concern about Donald Trump in 2016. It’s not just that he lacked elite support, but that he might alienate key Republican constituencies like the business community or evangelicals. (Both groups ultimately embraced Trump in 2016.) Nevertheless, when the party elites were unable to select the nominee, the large primary field yielded unpredictable results.
There are already signs that Democratic Party leaders may be slow to decide this year. But does this year’s unwieldy primary actually spell trouble for the Democrats? Or is the crowded field just evidence of natural fissures within the party?
As FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver wrote earlier this year, the size of the primary field can signal a lack of consensus within the party. In previous cycles, it has meant that both party elites and voters are slower to rally behind a single candidate. But as you’ll note in the table below, a crowded primary field hasn’t led to more losses at the general election level — in fact, there isn’t a real pattern at all.

* Excluding nomination processes for which an incumbent president was running for that party.
There’s no precise definition of what makes a candidate “noteworthy” — editor-in-chief Nate Silver created this list earlier in the year and erred on the side of inclusivity, although a few candidates may slipped through the cracks. The table includes candidates who withdrew before competing in any primaries.
Source: Wikipedia
As to why some primaries are so much more competitive than others, there isn’t a straightforward answer. Some in political science have argued that competitive primaries occur only when the party is already divided, which sounds like a plausible explanation for the 2020 Democratic primary, given the fractures that emerged in the party last cycle. The differences between the progressive and moderate wings of the party have arguably been exacerbated since 2016. Candidates in these two wings have already had some pretty serious disagreements over whether to scrap private health insurance entirely and how to reform the immigration system.
There are other splits in the party, too, that aren’t about policy. These divisions are generational and, at times, deeply personal. For instance, the Democratic Party is continuing to hash out how it will talk about race, as shown by a clash between Sen. Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden in the first debate over his remarks about working with segregationist senators and his opposition to school integration via busing in the 1970s. Gender also remains a flashpoint in the party, as some feel that gender worked against Clinton in 2016 and now have reservations about nominating a woman.
But these internal party conflicts aren’t necessarily a harbinger of failure. Sometimes a party split over big issues in the primary still wins the general. Take the 1980 Republican primary. There was an insurgent movement among conservatives like Ronald Reagan, who didn’t adhere to party orthodoxy and instead pushed for things like massive tax cuts without cuts to government spending, while more traditional Republicans like George H.W. Bush toed a more moderate, establishment-friendly line. (True, Bush later became Reagan’s running mate, but the 1980 contest still exposed a rift in the party that ultimately reshaped the party’s ideological direction.) Yet despite that intraparty turmoil, Reagan still managed to beat President Jimmy Carter resoundingly.1 A similar thing happened in the 2008 election. Despite a hard-fought competition — and an incredibly close one that had serious implications about gender and race — Obama still managed to win the general election handily.
Intraparty divisions are more visible in some cycles than others (such as this year), but I’d actually argue they’re a constant, not a variable. The idea of party unity tends to be an illusion. For example, Democratic and Republican parties winnowed their respective fields fairly quickly in 2000, giving the impression of unity. But serious policy divisions among Republicans affected George W. Bush’s agenda throughout his presidency. Notable Republicans like the late Sen. John McCain criticized efforts to enact a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage, and Bush’s efforts to reform immigration were deemed them insufficiently tough by members of his party.
Similarly, even though Obama was popular among Democrats and faced no real competition in the 2012 primaries, the fissures among Democrats were clear by the end of his presidency. Critics on the left had long been dissatisfied with the compromises the administration had made on the economic stimulus package and the Affordable Care Act, as well as the environment and immigration. And these complaints — particularly about economic issues — found a voice in the 2016 Sanders campaign.
But ultimately, as history shows us, a big or fragmented Democratic field doesn’t carry real general election risks. A large and unwieldy primary field can produce an unexpected nominee, but it doesn’t mean a party can’t or won’t rally behind a candidate by the time of the general election.
Granted, we can’t be totally sure of the effects of a field this large. But I’d argue that a primary as competitive as the current one can be better for the party than artificial unity (even if 12-candidate debates are a bit exhausting). The primary thus far has helped to clarify what those factions actually are — and what they’re not. It tells voters important things about the state of politics in the party, including divisions over policy solutions and among different demographics. It also illustrates the challenges faced by parties trying to resolve these issues and highlights the fact that democracy, even within parties, is difficult and often full of disagreement. All that said, having 10 or two candidates in the race by the Iowa caucuses should have little bearing on whether Democrats are competitive in 2020.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weve-already-seen-twice-as-many-presidential-tv-ads-as-at-this-point-in-the-2016-election/,2019-10-24,,,features,"Oct. 23, 2019",We’ve Already Seen Twice As Many Presidential TV Ads Than At This Point In The 2016 Election,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Over the course of the entire 2016 presidential election, TV ad spending approached a whopping $761 million, with more than 920,000 spots flickering across the airwaves. But that might be nothing compared to what we see in 2020. Thanks to Tom Steyer, who is pouring an enormous amount of money into TV ad buys, we are already ahead of 2016’s pace.
Using data from Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group, we can compare the pace of TV ad spending so far in 2019 with the same point in 2015. And so far, the 2020 campaign has seen more than twice as many television ad spots as the 2016 race. From Jan. 1 through Oct. 20, 2019, campaigns and outside groups spent an estimated $33.3 million on 76,030 television ad spots for the 2020 presidential election. By contrast, through the week of Oct. 18, 2015, campaigns and outside groups had aired only 32,191 TV spots — despite spending more money than they have so far this year ($43.1 million compared with $33.3 million).1
That disparity is especially wild considering that there were two competitive primaries in 2016 — on both the Republican and Democratic sides — while 2020 features just one spirited nomination fight. But already a total of 73,117 pro-Democratic spots have been aired in the presidential race so far compared with only 23,649 spots aired in 2015 by Republicans, whose primary (a record number of candidates, no dominant front-runner) resembles the current Democratic one.
And there’s basically one reason for that; his name is Tom Steyer. The self-funding billionaire has already aired 59,615 spots touting his candidacy, or 78 percent of all 2020 presidential spots so far — dropping an estimated $23.2 million in the process. In fact, without Steyer, advertising levels in the 2020 race look a lot more like 2016. Only 16,415 spots have been aired by sponsors other than Steyer, which is right in between the 23,649 GOP spots and the 8,388 Democratic spots aired through this point in 2015. It also wasn’t until Steyer jumped into the race in July that 2020 advertising really took off.
There wasn’t really a Steyer figure in the race in 2016, either. The most prolific advertiser at this point four years ago was former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, which had aired 7,380 spots (accounting for nearly a quarter of 2016 advertising at the time). Right to Rise, the super PAC created to support former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s campaign, was close behind with 6,590 spots aired, followed by the Opportunity and Freedom PAC (former Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s super PAC) with 3,441 spots aired. However, that’s more than anyone else (aside from Steyer) has aired so far in 2019 (Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand aired just 2,788 spots before dropping out, and President Trump has aired only 2,540 spots so far).
One underappreciated difference between 2016 and 2020 that can help explain what’s going on (in addition to Steyer’s well-lined pockets) is that super PACs are playing much less of a role this year. At this point in 2015, outside groups were behind 69 percent of all spots that had been aired, but here in 2019, campaigns have accounted for 98 percent of the spots so far. (This also might explain why TV spending is lower in 2019 than in 2015 even though more spots have been aired — campaigns get better rates than super PACs.) It has become increasingly fashionable in the Democratic primary to eschew big-money donors; 11 of the 18 “major” candidates by FiveThirtyEight’s definition have sworn off super PACs specifically, including all three top contenders.
It’s hard to know what this will mean for the rest of the 2020 cycle, particularly if Steyer doesn’t keep up his furious advertising pace. But for all the talk about the rise of digital campaign ads, it’s clear the 2020 candidates still think television is an effective way to reach their audience.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

$75 in school lunch debt
Officials in the Cherry Hill school district in New Jersey have approved a proposal that will allow principals to prevent students from participating in activities like field trips and dances if they are at least $75 behind in school lunch payments. The new plan came after students and parents protested the old policy of $10 in school lunch debt resulting in students being “forced to eat tuna fish sandwiches only.” The district has grappled with the issue of late meal payments before and forgave $25,000 of school lunch debt two years ago.

12.2 ounces
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Chances are you have no idea how much your jeans weigh, but it matters more than you think. For fall, you want something that’s not too heavy and not too light. These jeans weigh in at 12.2 ounces, and you’d be hard-pressed to find jeans better suited for the cooler weather ahead. They’re also made out of a unique fabric that boasts incredible softness, which adds a dimension to the overall comfort level of the jeans. First-time customers get 15 percent off, so they’re definitely worth checking out as temperatures start to drop.
76,030 television ad spots
Feel like you’re seeing more 2020 campaign ads? You’re not wrong. FiveThirtyEight analysis of data from Kantar/Campaign Media Analysis Group found that there have been more than twice as many television ad spots in this presidential election cycle than there were at this point in the 2016 election. Between Jan. 1 and Oct. 20, 2019, campaigns and outside groups spent an estimated $33.3 million on 76,030 television ad spots, compared with only 32,191 TV spots for the same period in 2015. Tom Steyer, a billionaire who is self-funding his campaign, is responsible for the bulk of this volume. He has aired 59,615 spots about his candidacy, or 78 percent of all 2020 presidential TV ads so far, at an estimated cost of $23.2 million. [FiveThirtyEight]
$10.7 million in federal loans and grants
Documents released Tuesday by the U.S. House Education and Labor Committee show that the Department of Education provided $10.7 million in federal loans and grants to students at two for-profit colleges that lacked accreditation and were ineligible to receive the financial aid. The Democratic chairman of the committee, Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, has threatened to subpoena Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for more documents related to efforts in her department to shield the owner of the schools “from the consequences of lying to students,” The Washington Post reports. Robert J. Infusino was $28,000 in debt and only a few months shy of completion of his audio production program at the Illinois Institute of Art when he found out that his school was closing and had lost accreditation six months earlier, making it “a nightmare” to transfer credits to another institution.

179,000 California customers
Utility company Pacific Gas & Electric Co. started another major safety blackout Wednesday afternoon in 17 California counties, the utility’s second deliberate power outage in two weeks. Power is being cut to approximately 179,000 households and businesses because of forecasts of dangerous winds that could cause wildfires in the area. The move follows an earlier blackout that cut off power to an estimated 2 million people over four days. [The Sacramento Bee]
$3.5 million in legislator spending
A detailed review of spending by lawmakers in Pennsylvania found records for expensive dinners in Germany and Austria, sports tickets, limousines, country club memberships, $3,500 in gift cards and even a DNA test kit. A nationwide survey by two organizations, The Caucus and Spotlight PA, found that nearly $3.5 million was spent by state House and Senate candidates from 2016 to 2018 through campaign accounts for items that “cannot be fully traced,” resulting in incomplete information in official records and publicly available finance documents. Pennsylvania is the only state that neither limits contributions nor explicitly bans personal use of campaign cash, giving it some of the country’s weakest campaign finance laws. [Spotlight PA]
1.25 carat diamond
Canadians may be known for apologizing a lot, but there’s nothing humble about the championship ring that was given out to players during the Toronto Raptors’ season opener on Tuesday night. The enormous piece of jewelry sports a 1.25 carat diamond on its face, just one of the more than 650 diamonds on the ring. The rings were produced by the same Canadian company behind the Cleveland Cavaliers’ championship ring in 2016; the Raptors claim it’s the largest, most expensive NBA championship ring ever made.

Because the pro-style devotee runs “a more traditional program,” Shaw told me this offseason, he will typically look to the NFL rather than his college contemporaries for schematic inspiration.1
This is likely why Shaw was ahead of his peers on one front: showcasing the value of the dual-purpose tight end. Even if the position’s worth at the NFL level arguably reached its high-water mark years ago, the golden age of the college tight end has just arrived. Since Shaw was installed as head coach prior to the 2011 season, the Cardinal has featured tight ends in the passing game more than any Power Five conference team in the country.2 Stanford has had 34 players selected in the NFL draft under Shaw, and six were tight ends — the most of any position group.
This season, however, Shaw isn’t the only coach spotlighting a position that’s traditionally been kept in the shadows, an outlet receiver once only used if all other options were exhausted. From a statistical perspective, it’s never been more fruitful to play tight end at the college level.3
The position’s evolution — from lineman facsimile to occasional route-runner to dynamic playmaker — is a microcosm for the shift in how coaches employ the athletes they put on the field. One-note skillsets are out, versatility is in.
At the Power Five level this season, coaches have used at least one tight end on 86.5 percent of all offensive snaps, a rate roughly 34 percentage points higher than it was at the same point in the season in 2014. And that heightened usage isn’t just for show. Tight ends have combined to accumulate 1,271 receptions on 1,941 targets, 15,144 receiving yards and 145 touchdowns, the highest marks at this point in each respective season since at least 2008.
Since the 2004 season, there have been 55 instances of a Power Five tight end accumulating at least 350 receiving yards through the seventh game of the season. Nine have occurred this season.
As the proliferation of pass-heavy offensive ecosystems continues at both the college and professional levels, it stands to reason that catch-capable players would see their raw totals spike. But even while accounting for that, the volume of tight end production is steadily rising.
Since the 2014 season, the share of receptions4 collected by tight ends through seven games has risen from 10.6 percent to 14.0 percent, while the share of receiving yards has climbed from 9.9 percent to 13.5 percent. Tight ends have accounted for 14.3 percent of all passing first downs, up over 4 percentage points from the 2010 season. Accordingly, quarterbacks are looking for tight ends more often, as they now garner 13.8 percent of targets, their highest share of targets at this point of any season since at least 2010.
Merely targeting tight ends in the passing game has also become more worthwhile, as it relates to generating successful plays. Per target, tight ends have accounted for 0.27 expected points added, an increase of nearly 60 percent from the position’s contribution in the 2015 season.
That evolution of tight ends is reflected even where they line up on the field. Through seven games, tight ends have accounted for 46 receptions when lined up out wide.5 Last year, they had 71 over the entire season. The new tight ends run routes like wide receivers do and prey on the linebackers who are often assigned to defend them.
And with those alterations comes a new prototype. Draft evaluators must now consider not only size and strength, but also whether the athlete has soft hands, route-running proficiency, in-air coordination and speed. “Tight ends,” Washington State coach Mike Leach once said, “are a blast if you have them. If you have a true tight end — and I mean a true tight end — then life is good.”
While the vast majority of NFL tight ends have college experience, that has not been a critical prerequisite for several star tight ends in the last 20 years.6 Perhaps the success of these once-unorthodox players has contributed to the rise of the modern-day tight end. Though, to be sure, the route-running and playmaking component of this generation of tight ends has come with a tradeoff for some who — in get-off-my-lawn fashion — bemoan the blocking inability of the newest crop.
For nearly a half-century, the tight end position was shorthand for a player predominantly tasked with blocking who would occasionally haul in a short-yardage pass. A coach wouldn’t have dreamed of focusing his playbook on the position that stood as a glorified lineman. But the days of the traditional tight end are over. The 2018 NFL season included two of the five highest single-season target totals ever for tight ends. And in college, tight ends are finding their way into the box score like never before, garnering an increasing share of targets, receptions, yards and touchdowns. What once was an afterthought is now a viable threat in any situation.

After surviving Florida in the second-most-important game of Week 7, LSU and its brutal schedule are back for the biggest game of Week 9. This time, the Bayou Bengals will host Auburn, which lost in its own showdown against the Gators the week before LSU faced them. Our model has LSU favored here, with a 66 percent chance of winning, and the Tigers had better take advantage with a trip to Tuscaloosa looming in two weeks. LSU is one of eight undefeated major-conference schools (along with Clemson, Alabama, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Penn State, Baylor and Minnesota), and the Tigers’ remaining schedule — including this game against Auburn — is the most difficult of the bunch in terms of its opponents’ average Elo rating. If LSU does lose to Alabama, it can scarcely afford to lose this one as well and still hope to make the playoff. As for Auburn, it still has an outside shot (8 percent) at a playoff bid, and that number would rise to 21 percent (basically the same chance Penn State has right now, for comparison’s sake) if it can knock off LSU. Auburn just needs to keep winning — a task a lot easier said than done against a remaining schedule just as tough as LSU’s. Either way, basically every other top contender in the country (except Alabama) is rooting for an Auburn win.

On Thursday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar earned 3 percent support in a new Quinnipiac University national poll. It was the final piece of the puzzle she needed to qualify for the debate, which will be held on Nov. 20 in Georgia.
As a reminder, the Democratic National Committee’s qualifying criteria for the fifth debate require candidates to get at least 3 percent support in four national or early-state1 polls sponsored by a DNC-approved organization or at least 5 percent in two early-state polls.2 Candidates also need contributions from at least 165,000 individual donors (including at least 600 individual donors from each of 20 states or territories).3

*For candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight.
To qualify for the fifth debate, a candidate must reach 3 percent in at least four national or early-state polls or 5 percent in at least two early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations. Candidates must also have at least 165,000 unique donors, including at least 600 donors in at least 20 states or territories. We rely on self-reported figures from the campaigns for candidates’ fundraising numbers, and we’ve assumed that candidates who have reported having at least 165,000 donors also have at least 600 donors in 20 states or territories.
Sources: Polls, campaigns, media reports
Klobuchar’s qualification might come as a bit of a surprise, considering that, just a couple of weeks ago, she had only one qualifying poll under her belt. But after the October debate, in which she had a strong performance, she’s ticked up enough in the polls to hit 3 percent in three qualifying polls conducted in the past week. However, don’t call it a surge; she has yet to get above 3 percent in any recent national poll and sits at 2.0 percent in the RealClearPolitics polling average. If she is breaking through anywhere, though, it might be in Iowa, where she has been focusing her campaigning. Two of her four qualifying polls came from that state.
Even though the qualifying criteria for the fifth debate are stricter than previous debates, they haven’t done much to winnow the field from the 12-candidate stage in October. Only three candidates from that debate are on the outside looking in for November. Of those three:
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke appears to have the best chance of making it; he has two of the four polls he needs to qualify. If he qualifies, that would bring the November stage to an even 10 debaters.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard only has one qualifying poll so far, so her odds of making the stage are longer. Her lone qualifying poll, however, came right on the heels of the October debate, so the timing is probably encouraging to her campaign.
Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, though, is in pretty bad shape. He has yet to pick up a single qualifying poll, leaving him in real danger of missing a debate for the first time. Previously, Castro has said that not qualifying for the November debate would “be the end of my campaign.” His campaign also seems to be teetering on the edge of viability generally, as he has also threatened to drop out of the race if he does not raise $800,000 by the end of October.
As for all the other “major” candidates (by FiveThirtyEight’s definition), not one has a single qualifying poll, nor have any of them met the donor threshold, so the other five candidates in our table seem very unlikely to make it. So the real question is whether O’Rourke, Gabbard or Castro can pull a Klobuchar and nab several qualifying polls in quick succession to make the November debate stage. They might have to — the Nov. 13 deadline to qualify is coming up fast.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tim-ryan-becomes-2020s-latest-also-ran/,2019-10-24,,,features,"Oct. 24, 2019",Tim Ryan Becomes 2020’s Latest Also-Ran,Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Slowly but surely, the winnowing process is taking its toll on the Democratic presidential field. On Thursday, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan dropped out of the race to focus on his reelection bid in the House. On the surface, the congressman’s electoral pitch as a moderate, blue-collar Democrat from the traditional swing state of Ohio had a fair bit of potential, too. But unlike South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg or even Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Ryan failed to attract enough support to carve out some sort of lane for himself in the primary.
Some of Ryan’s struggles came down to the nature of the field and his relatively low profile coming into the race. As a House member, Ryan might have started out at a disadvantage compared to some candidates who held or had held higher offices. If Ryan had been, say, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown — who opted not to run for president — things might have gone differently. Even after six or so months of campaigning, Ryan wasn’t that well known. Only about half of Democrats had an opinion about him back in late August, and recent polling suggests that he wasn’t becoming better known, either. Of course, if former Vice President Joe Biden hadn’t gotten into the race, it’s possible that some moderate Democrats would have considered Ryan as an alternative. In the end, Ryan wasn’t even able to attract the very low threshold of support necessary — 2 percent in four qualifying polls and 130,000 unique donors — to qualify for the third and fourth debates (he wasn’t on track to make the fifth debate, either).
Ryan’s lack of financial resources also factored into his campaign’s difficulties and eventual demise. In the second quarter of 2019, he raised roughly $900,000, which would have been a great fundraising haul for his House race but was woefully inadequate for a presidential candidate (and the second-lowest amount of any “major” presidential candidate at the time, per FiveThirtyEight’s criteria). And in the third quarter he fared even worse, bringing in only $425,000 with just $160,000 in the bank. Although Ryan could theoretically have stayed in the race for months to come — Ohio law permits someone to run for president and the House at the same time — it’s tough to maintain a presidential campaign if you have virtually no money, so Ryan’s poor fundraising was probably the nail in his campaign’s coffin.
If Ryan had had a breakthrough in the two debates he participated in, maybe he could’ve raised a bit more money or attracted more support in the polls. But he didn’t have a “moment” in the debates, much less in the campaign as a whole. Just as things didn’t pan out for Reps. Eric Swalwell and Seth Moulton, Ryan’s failure is yet another example of how hard it is for a House member to run for president.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Riddler Express
This week, Eli Luberoff presents a puzzle in which artistry meets geometry. While at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Eli snapped the following picture from an exhibit by Sol LeWitt:
What’s the volume of the darkened solid?
(Assume the outer cube is a unit cube, and that the faces of the solid meet the edges of the unit cube halfway and a fourth of the way along its edges. In other words, the drawing is to scale!)

Riddler Classic
I want to carve the perfect eye for my pumpkin this Halloween, but I can’t seem to make it the right size. Since symmetry is the key to beauty, the triangular eye should be equilateral and equiangular, which is easier said than done on the surface of a spherical pumpkin!
To be a proper triangle, the three corners should be connected by arcs that are “straight,” meaning they go directly from one corner to the next via the shortest possible path. (Think about air travel: When you flying from the West Coast of the U.S. to Europe, you’ll fly north of the Arctic Circle along the way, since that’s the shortest path over the Earth’s curved surface.)
Anyway, the triangular eye that I made is way too big. Its sides all meet at right angles, and the resulting eye takes up a whole eighth of the pumpkin’s surface, as seen in the animation below.
Instead, I want an eye that’s precisely half that size, or one-sixteenth of the pumpkin’s surface. For such an ideal pumpkin eye, at what angle should each of the sides meet?

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏James Sears 👏 of Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, winner of last week’s Riddler Express.
Last week, you had to navigate your way through the number maze below. The number in each box told you how many spaces up, down, left or right you must move to get to the next box. You started at the yellow 6 in the bottom left corner, and you were challenged to make your way to the asterisk.
James found his solution by working backwards. First, he tried to find a square from which you could get to the asterisk. Such a square would have to be in the same row or column as the asterisk. The only square that works is the 2 that’s two squares left of the asterisk — no other square in the asterisk’s row or column has a number that equals how many squares away from the asterisk it is. Next, from which squares could you get to that 2? The only such square is a 6 that’s six rows up. Continuing in this fashion, James found a nine-step path that works:
Much of Riddler Nation took this puzzle one step further, trying to find the shortest path to the asterisk. David Schwab of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (man, the Canadians crushed it this week!) performed a breadth-first search, starting with the 6 in the lower left and finding all the squares you could move to, and labeled them as reachable within one step. Then, he found all the squares you could get to from those squares and labeled them as reachable within two steps. He continued this process until all the squares were reached, resulting in the following guide through the maze:
The number in the top left corner of each square indicates how many moves are required to reach that square, starting from the 6 in the lower left corner. It turns out that the asterisk can be reached in eight moves. Meanwhile, that 7 in the top right is the toughest to reach, requiring a whopping 16 moves. Who knew?
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏Kyle Tripp 👏 of Concord, California, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic.
Last week you converted dollars into the currency of Riddler Nation: the Dio, worth $538, and the Phantus, worth $19. For example, if you wanted to convert $614, you’d get one Dio and four Phanti, since 614 = 1×538 + 4×19. But if you tried to exchange one dollar more (i.e., $615), then alas, no combination of Dios and Phanti would work. What was the largest number of dollars that could not be converted into Dios and Phanti?
The name of the currency was a clue. Diophantus was a Greek mathematician and the namesake of Diophantine equations, which are polynomial equations that only seek integer solutions. For this particular riddle, the Diophantine equation of interest was 538x + 19y = z, where x represents the number of Dios, y is the number of Phanti, and z is the number of dollars.
Solver Guy Moore solved the problem by looking at increments of 538. For dollar amounts less than 538, only multiples of 19 are exchangeable, all the way up to 19×28 = 532.
Beyond 538, you have more possibilities because we’re working with a second denomination. You can now exchange dollar amounts that are multiples of 19 (in other words, that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 19), as well as dollar amounts that can be exchanged for exactly one Dio and any number of Phanti, such as 538, 557 (538 + 19), 576 (538 + 19 + 19) and so on. You’ll notice that all those numbers share something in common: When divided by 19, they have a remainder of six. That’s because when the number 538 is divided by 19, it leaves a remainder of six.
All this talk of remainders might seem superfluous, but they’re important for understanding how to get to a solution.
When you reach 1,076 (538×2), you can exchange dollar amounts that are multiples of 19, dollar amounts that have a remainder of six when divided by 19 and dollar amounts that have a remainder of 12 when divided by 19. (That’s because when the number 1,076 is divided by 19, it leaves a remainder of 12.)
If you keep going, numbers with different remainders (when divided by 19) become exchangeable every time you hit another multiple of 538. All the numbers become exchangeable when, at last, you reach the 18th (i.e., one less than 19) multiple of 538 — 9,684 — which happens to have a remainder of 13 when divided by 19. Beyond 9,684, every single dollar amount — no matter its remainder when divided by 19 — is exchangeable. For example, what about a large number like 100,000? That equals 538×10 + 4,980×19. That’s a lot of Phanti!
But we still have to find an answer! Let’s return to our discovery of 9,684, which was the first multiple of 538 with a remainder of 13 when divided by 19. (The 13 isn’t very important here — it just happens to be the last of the 19 possible remainders to become exchangeable.) That means numbers less than 9,684 with the same remainder of 13 are not exchangeable. The largest of these is 9,684 – 19 = 9,665, the correct answer.
Many solvers were also quick to point out that this riddle was essentially asking for the Frobenius number, which is the largest value that a set of numbers cannot generate when multiplied by whole numbers and then added together. The Frobenius number for two numbers whose greatest common factor is one can be found by subtracting one from each number, multiplying those values and then subtracting one from that product. In this case, that’s (538 – 1)(19 – 1) – 1, which indeed equals 9,665.
For extra credit, you were asked how your answer would change upon the inclusion of a third currency, worth $101. Guy observed that the Dio would then be equivalent to 23 Phanti plus this new $101 denomination. That means that any time you exchange dollars for a Dio, you could have similarly exchanged it for Phanti and $101s. In other words, the Dio just became obsolete in our calculations! Therefore, the solution to the extra credit was simply the Frobenius number for 101 and 19, which is 1,799.
So when you travel to Riddler Nation, be sure to try to exchange exactly $9,665. They might throw you out of the country, but they’d just as likely applaud your mastery of number theory.

20 percent
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Why are some jeans comfortable, while others simply aren’t? Denim is denim, right? Wrong. Jeans made of fabric that offer higher “stretch factors” tend to be more comfortable. For a real comfortable pair of jeans, you want to be right around the 20 percent stretch factor mark, like these men’s jeans.
2.9 percent + $0.35
After a wave of cancelled subscriptions, Patreon (the crowdfunding platform) backed off proposed changes to its payment policies. Essentially, the company had planned to charge a one-time 2.9 percent fee for a recurring donation, plus $0.35 for each donation. And that money would have come from the consumer, not the creator. This would have disproportionately affected people giving and relying on small contributions. The company said it will rethink the strategy. [Vice]
7 percent
After three decades of their numbers declining, the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in Roanoke, Virginia, rose 7 percent between 2010 and 2015. The city is having a renaissance of late, and observers comparing it to the rest of Appalachia want to figure out how Roanoke did it. [CityLab]
About 90 percent

505.5 billion rubles
Well, that’s peculiar: In just one month Russia’s budget deficit for 2017 nearly doubled. The Russian budget deficit was 261.4 billion rubles in the first 10 months of the year, and now — according to data released on Tuesday — has jumped to 505.5 billion rubles ($8.53 billion). Legislation caps annual budget deficits at 1.92 trillion rubles (or 2.1 percent of GDP). [Reuters]

An economic collapse that began in 2014 has led to staggering problems across Venezuela. Malnutrition is a huge one. And while the government has been suppressing data about the extent of the problem, a 2015 report showed the mortality rate for children under four weeks in Venezuela had increased to 2 percent, from 0.02 percent in 2012.

When you start approaching stretch factors of 35 percent, like these jeans, you can do pretty much any activity you want in them.

8 octogenarians
There are eight senators who are at least 80-years-old, nearly twice as many as ever before. The varying health needs of those senators has required some logistical maneuvering from leadership in order to schedule votes. Still, being one of the most powerful people in the country is pretty sweet — all things considered — so senators have an incentive to remain in their positions as long as they can. [The Washington Post]
11 percentage points
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Republicans getting slammed on the generic ballot: 50 percent of respondents said they preferred Democrats lead Congress next year to 39 percent who preferred Republicans, the first double-digit lead in the poll for Democrats since 2008. The Wall Street Journal/NBC News figures are in line with FiveThirtyEight’s tracker, which looks at all polls and has Democrats leading Republicans 48.7 percent to 37.6 percent. [The Wall Street Journal, FiveThirtyEight]
1,180 flight cancellations
An 11-hour power outage affecting the cornerstone of the U.S. air transportation system, Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, led to 1,180 flight cancellations in and out of Atlanta. [CNN]
$220 million
“Star Wars: The Last Jedi” made $220 million in the U.S. and Canada in its opening weekend, which makes it only the fourth film to open above $200 million. Adjusted for inflation, it’s looking at a release on par with 2012’s “The Avengers.” [USA Today]

13.5 percent
Cape Town, South Africa, has fewer than 90 days left of water in its reservoirs. It’s projected that by April 22 the city will have to shut down the municipal water supply except for essential services, as reservoirs will be down to 13.5 percent capacity. [Time]
14 prototype shirts
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Quality shirts aren’t built in a day. From shirt length to button placement, every detail needs to be taken into consideration. It took 14 prototypes to create these shirts, which eliminate constraint via a well-placed bottom button, and can be worn tucked or untucked thanks to carefully thought-out shirt lengths.
15 percent
A study monitoring pollution in the vicinity of a 100-meter-high experimental air purifier outside the Chinese city of Xian in the Saanxi province found encouraging results during times of heavy pollution, with the most dangerous fine particles found in smog down 15 percent. [South China Morning Post]
27 percent
Percentage of Americans who said they were very confident that they were capable of telling if a news source was reporting factual news rather than opinion. That is way too low for comfort. [Knight Foundation]
47 percent
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies took a serious tumble on Tuesday, with Bitcoin’s value dropping almost 25 percent in 24 hours and down by 47 percent from its all-time high in December. There were similar double-digit drops for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Monero and Ethereum. [Ars Technica]
3.2 million
After a year of repeated attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and undermine its implementation, the number of American adults who do not have health insurance rose by 3.2 million people in 2017. [The Week]
$108.2 billion
Amount consumers spent online during the 2017 U.S. holiday season, up 14.7 percent year-over-year and nearly a billion dollars above expectations. [Adobe CMO]

15.1 percent
Congratulations, songwriters, you’re getting a raise: the Copyright Royalty Board ruled that songwriters will get a 15.1 percent share of streaming revenues over the next five years, up from the current rate of 10.5 percent. Streaming providers like Spotify and Pandora will lose money as a result, but it’s the biggest such raise that rights holders have ever seen. [Bloomberg]
29.4 minutes
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) When most people put on a new pair of jeans, they don’t really think about the time and effort that went into making it. But a quality pair of comfortable, stylish premium men’s jeans, like these, requires 29.4 minutes of manufacturing time. That’s 29.4 actual work-minutes, excluding idle time that the jeans spend in queues, to get the ideal look and fit.
47 percent
The percentage of foreign investment in the state of Kentucky that comes from Japan. Parts of Kentucky have long been hotbeds of Japanese food and culture in the U.S. Demand for Japanese specialty stores and restaurants throughout the region spiked as Japanese employees came to Kentucky, and U.S. employees visited Japan for training. [NPR]
12,000 people
Around 12,000 people have been hospitalized in the U.S. with the flu this season, as of the week ending Jan. 20. It’s on track to be the worst in a decade. [The Washington Post]
$100,000
Steve Wynn, a gambling magnate who was the Republican National Committee finance chairman and a top GOP fundraiser, has stepped down from his RNC position. Allegations of Wynn’s sexual misconduct toward employees was described in a bombshell Wall Street Journal report that spoke to “150 current and former employees.” Wynn gave $100,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in this electoral cycle alone. [CNN]
200 million fake followers
The company Devumi sells social media followers to the vain or insufficiently popular, but the followers are not real people. Instead, they’re just weird robot zombies emulating people: the company draws on 3.5 million automated accounts that are sold multiple times, selling some 200 million fake followers. [The New York Times]
$18.4 billion
Worldwide sales of Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis medication, up 14 percent in 2017. Humira is just one pharmaceutical marketed by AbbVie, but it would be bigger than companies like General Mills and Xerox if it were its own company. [Axios]

36 to 71
The Florida House voted down by a vote of 36 to 71 a procedural move to allow the body to even consider banning assault rifles and large capacity magazines. They did this in front of survivors of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. [ABC 10 News]
51 percent
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Every man knows that a good pair of jeans can go a long way. What many men don’t realize is that you don’t have to pay inflated prices for quality. Jeans like these cost 51 percent less than other jeans of the same exact quality, offering style and comfort without the markup.
3.3 percent
Walmart is fighting a pitched battle online with Amazon, but it’s incurring some serious damage to its bottom line in doing so. This past quarter saw Walmart’s operating margin slip to 3.3 percent, the lowest operating margin in its history. [Bloomberg]
10 percent
The supplement business in the United States is worth $30 billion, and the reality is that there’s zero evidence for most of the more than 90,000 vitamin and dietary supplements that they do much of anything. Still, 52 percent of Americans take a supplement of some kind, with 10 percent of Americans consuming four or more supplements. [Ars Technica]
41,129 shares
The Florida Retirement System Pension Plan, which serves the state’s teachers, has a significant investment in American Outdoor Brands Co. — the very same company that manufactured the AR-15 assault rifle used in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting last week — to the tune of 41,129 shares, worth roughly half a million dollars. [Bloomberg]
208,000 euros
A wealthy German was fined 208,000 euros for attempting to pass off 47 euros worth of veal as cheap fruit at a self-check-out stand in a grocery store. This was the fourth such attempt by the man, who had previously been convicted of theft and tax evasion. He’s not exactly hurting given his monthly income of 24,000 euros, so the German court threw the book at him. [ABC News]
$30 million
San Francisco Public Works spends $60.1 million for street environmental services, and the director of the public works department estimates approximately $30 million of that goes toward cleaning up human feces and needles from sidewalks and homeless encampments. [NBC Bay Area]

62 co-sponsors
A piece of legislation in the U.S. Senate that would improve data reporting to the national gun background check database has 62 co-sponsors but is still being held up by Republicans. It’s one of the only bills addressing gun deaths that has even a remote chance of becoming a law in the current Congress. On Monday, President Trump walked back his televised declaration that he would push for near-universal background checks and raising the age limit to purchase rifles. [The New York Times]
40 singles
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Not all t-shirts are created equal. In fact, the industry has a way of measuring the quality of the cotton thread used in the t-shirt that they’re selling you. Manufacturers go by a unit called a “single,” which is a measurement of the fineness of cotton thread. If it takes only 20 spools of thread to weigh one pound, then the thread is said to be “20 singles.” If it takes 30 spools of thread to weigh one pound, then the thread is said to be “30 singles,” and so on. For a truly soft, fine, comfortable t-shirt that also looks good, look for something around 40 singles, like these.
No. 169
One week after hitting No. 1 on the Billboard album charts, Bon Jovi’s album “This House Is Not For Sale” dropped 168 spots to No. 169, the largest-ever one-week drop in the six-decade history of the chart’s existence. The No. 1 placement was tied to a deal that bundled CD sales with concert tickets. [The New York Times]
700 patients
In a devastating lapse, 2,000 frozen eggs and embryos at a Cleveland fertility clinic may no longer be viable after temperatures rose due to a refrigeration issue. The hospital has informed roughly 700 people that the frozen eggs and embryos may have suffered damage. [The Washington Post]
21 million
That’s the maximum number of bitcoins that can be created, and as of January about 80 percent of that hard cap was already in existence. The final 20 percent will have to be created through complex cryptographic puzzles, and those who want to actually make money mining them are looking for cheap land, cheap power, good Internet and a steady government. The mining towns of the West are once again seeing “miners.” [BuzzFeed]
$213 million
Oklahoma state employees are poised to strike if the state fails to approve $213 million in raises by April 2. In addition, the Oklahoma Education Association is demanding more than $800 million in raises for teachers and school funding, along with the state workers’ pay increases, to avoid a strike. [News OK]
$117 billion
President Trump took the highly unusual move of issuing an executive order to block a $117 billion acquisition of Qualcomm Inc. by rival chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, which is based in Singapore. The pair of chip manufacturers has been in M&A fight over the attempted acquisition for some time. The president cited national security concerns over the business deal. [Bloomberg]

20 percent
Percentage of renters who have no interest in owning a home, according to the latest from a semiannual Freddie Mac survey. That’s up from 13 percent in 2016. Personally, I’m still feeling pretty burned by the crushing debt of a college degree and I’m not exactly itching to dive into a second crushing debt of a home, but that may just be me. [The Wall Street Journal]
4 ways
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) A typical pair of jeans derives comfort using a 2-way stretch design that works horizontally. One denim brand decided to add an extra dimension to their way of thinking, and introduced these 4-way stretch jeans that work in both vertical and horizontal directions, allowing for maximum mobility and comfort.
 
27 candidates
All told 27 different candidates are slated to appear on California’s gubernatorial primary ballot on June 5. The top two vote getters, regardless of party, will proceed to the general election this fall. The two top contenders are Democrats Gavin Newsom and Antonio Villaraigosa, but multi-candidate fields are weird, so Democrat John Chiang and Republican John Cox are also in this. [The New York Times]
74.5 percent
In 2016, gun homicides made up 74.5 percent of all homicides, the highest share in all the years for which data exists since 1910. Since the late sixties, gun homicides usually accounted for something between 60 and 70 percent of all killings. [The Washington Post]
95 percent
That’s the percentage of the world cocoa output that is produced by small farmers. The issue with cocoa production is that yields are flat, and there aren’t really ways to get more cocoa out of a plot of land. As a result, supply increases to meet the ravenous demand for chocolate mean that cultivators have had to expand their footprint. Ivory Coast, the No. 1 grower of cocoa, cut down 64 percent of its forest cover from 1990 to 2015, lots of which went to cocoa farming land. [Bloomberg]
5,776 isolates
When the principal deputy director of the CDC says something like “I was surprised by the numbers we found” with regards to a report studying new and highly antibiotic resistant bacteria, maybe it’s an opportunity to reflect on how much you wash your hands. The report studied 5,776 isolates of antibiotic resistant bacteria collected from hospitals and nursing homes and found one in four had a gene that helped it become resistant to drugs and 221 had a particularly rare gene. Those 221 gnarly varieties were found in 27 different states. [CNN]
$940 million
Approximate value of Spotify shares that changed hands yesterday, as the music streaming company went public to a modest gain 13 percent above its $132 reference price. That trade volume is the fourth largest opening trading day since 2010. [The Wall Street Journal]

2 models
Ford will eliminate most of its traditional car offerings in North America, and plans to sell only two different types of traditional cars, the Mustang and the new Focus Active. The overwhelming majority of Ford sales in the U.S. are trucks, SUVs and commercial vehicles, thus undermining the need for a diverse line of smaller cars. [TechCrunch]
135 grams
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) You’ve probably never thought about the weight per square meter of your t-shirt, but it matters. Too heavy and you won’t be very comfortable. Too light and your shirt probably won’t last very long. Ideally, you want a shirt that clocks in at about 135 grams per square meter, like these butter-soft premium t-shirts.
19 states
The U.S. E. coli outbreak is worsening. There have now been 84 cases in 19 states, with 42 of those cases resulting in hospitalization. That’s a higher than typical rate of hospitalization, and a great reason to just stop eating romaine lettuce for the time being. [The Washington Post]
35 percent
A Department of Housing and Urban Development proposal would hike the rents of people living in federally subsidized housing. Currently these residents have to pay 30 percent of their adjusted income as rent, but the new rules would hike that up to 35 percent of gross income. This will affect roughly half of the 4.7 million families who receive housing benefits. [The Washington Post]
43 percent
That’s the percentage of Americans aged 18 to 29 who believe in a God as described in the bible, the lowest percentage in any age bracket. Contrast that with the 67 percent of 50 to 64-year-olds who believe in that conception of God. Still, the aggregate amount of 18 to 29-year-olds who believe in some sort of god, higher power or spiritual force (83 percent) is only 13 points lower than in the 50 to 64 bracket. The faith of younger people tends to be a little bit more unclear and non-name brand than their parents’. [Pew Research Center]
44,000 locations
After potentially misunderstanding a bunch of New Yorkers’ tweets calling on a higher power to fix the damn subway, the sandwich chain Subway will close roughly 500 locations in North America this year. Subway’s footprint is enormous — there are 44,000 locations globally, which is way higher than the 14,000 McDonald’s locations worldwide. [CNN]
$20 billion
SoftBank is a major investor in Silicon Valley, and has about $20 billion in investments in ride-hailing companies. SoftBank is now planning to transfer some of those enormous investments to The Vision Fund, run by a SoftBank board member and funded by Saudi Arabia. If that kind of consolidation happens, the transfer could make The Vision Fund one of the most consequential investors in the ride-hailing space. [The Financial Times]

11.8 percent
The U.S. Post Office saw a shipping and package income of $19.5 billion last year, which is up 11.8 percent compared to the previous year. It was a bright spot in an otherwise tough financial position brought about thanks to a decline in first class mail and high health benefit costs the USPS is forced to set aside. Industry analysts believe about 40 percent of Amazon packages are delivered by the Postal Service and the company spent $21.7 billion on shipping costs in 2017. [The Washington Post]
37 percent
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) When you’re picking out a pair of jeans, you probably look at things like size and color. Next time, pay attention to the stretch factor, too. The higher the stretch factor, the more versatile the jeans are. These jeans have a sky-high stretch factor of 37 percent, allowing for comfort and freedom of movement without sacrificing the denim look.
38 percent
“Deadpool 2” won the box office and usurped “Avengers: Infinity War,” pulling in $125 million domestically and $176 million abroad in 81 markets, the biggest international opening for Fox ever. Market research indicated — and I don’t mean to shock you here — that the Deadpool movie’s audience skewed young (38 percent of ticket buyers were younger than 25) and male (61 percent). [The Hollywood Reporter]
60 plates per second
Automated license plate readers are devices that are mounted on police cars and can scan license plates — to the tune of up to 60 plates per second — and run those plates against a list of ones law enforcement suspects may be a potentially wanted or stolen vehicle. It’s a Constitutionally grey area — the closest we get to precedence vis-a-vis the necessity of a warrant is a 1983 Supreme Court case — but that’s not stopping even more sophisticated versions of LPRs to hit the market, like a new upgrade from manufacturer ELSAG that allows the devices to identify “color, seven body types, 34 makes, and nine visual descriptors” on top of the plate. [Ars Technica]
42 percent
A study of the 34 scripted shows slotted to debut on network television this fall found that 42 percent of key roles went to women and an equal number went to people of color. This is up from the batch of shows debuting last fall, when 35 percent of key roles in scripted shows on ABC, CBS, the CW, Fox, and NBC went to women and only 20 percent went to people of color. [Variety]
60 percent
By dollar value, that’s the percentage of electronic components in the ZTE Axon M phone that originate from U.S. companies like Qualcomm, SanDisk, Skyworks Solutions and Corning. This poses a mild problem, given a U.S. ban on shipments of phone parts to ZTE began in mid-April. [The Wall Street Journal]
271 coin offerings
A Wall Street Journal analysis of 1,450 digital coin offerings — instances where firms raise money off of a new cryptocurrency — found that in 271 cases there were red flags like plagiarism in investor documents, missing or fake executives or implications of guaranteed money. Those 271 iffy offerings have pulled in over a billion dollars from investors, which is an enormous chunk of the about $5 billion raised by the 1,450 coins studied. [The Wall Street Journal]
Thank you

5 days of protests
The prime minister of Jordan, Hani al-Mulki, has resigned following five days of nationwide protests against austerity measures in that country, including tax hikes and subsidy cuts. Roads were blocked, tires burned and a “sea of protesters has been gathering outside al-Mulki’s office at night, after the breaking of the Ramadan fast at dusk.” [CNN]
2,350 t-shirts
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) When you find a t-shirt that looks good and fits right, get one while you still can. These t-shirts perfectly combine comfort and style, which explains why 2,350 of them were sold during their launch week alone. That type of demand can be tough to keep up with. Fortunately, the manufacturer was able to replenish most sizes just in time for summer.
16-hour eruption
A volcano in Guatemala called Fuego erupted for 16 hours on Sunday. That was followed on Monday by further pyroclastic flow — a mix of lava, pumice, ash and volcanic gas that races down slopes at temperatures of up to 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. The volcano has killed 62 people, according to officials, and dozens more are missing. [BBC]
18 seconds
Senator Ted Cruz, a constitutional lawyer, was asked by a reporter if he agreed with the president that the president could pardon himself. Eighteen silent, torturous seconds followed. “That is not a constitutional issue I’ve studied,” he finally responded. [Mediaite]
13,000 projects
Microsoft has purchased GitHub. It cost the multinational behemoth $7.5 billion in stock to acquire the free code and data hosting service that had become the “de facto home of open source software development.” (I use it myself, as does FiveThirtyEight.) More than 13,000 projects left GitHub within an hour of the news, migrating to its competitor, GitLab. [Motherboard]
21,000 percent growth
Howard Schultz, the executive chairman of Starbucks, is stepping down at the end of the month. Schultz joined the company in 1982, and Starbucks stock has grown 21,000 percent since its IPO in 1992. He owns shares worth $2.2 billion. And of course, the buzz goes, he’s running for president. As my boss tweeted: “Hard to think of anyone who would formulate a better contrast with Trump than an old white business dude who once ran a professional sports team into the ground.” [CNBC]
$4.84 million in crosswords and cooking
The New York Times crossword puzzle is serious business. The paper’s crossword and cooking products generated $4.84 million in the first quarter. (The company reports the two products’ financials together, despite the fact that many people can be hopeless crossword addicts who don’t really cook. Or at least that’s what I tell myself.) Its online puzzle has over 400,000 subscribers, nearly double its total two years ago. The growth has been driven, apparently, by mini-crosswords and expansion to Android devices. The paper pays its freelance crossword constructors about $150,000 a year — about $300-$450 for a weekday and $1,000-$1,200 for a Sunday puzzle. [Bloomberg]

45-minute press conference
In a surreal 45-minute joint press conference with President Vladimir Putin of Russia in Finland yesterday, President Trump rejected his own intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 American election, instead favoring Putin’s apparent denial and refusing to condemn the Kremlin. “[Putin] just said it’s not Russia,” Trump said. “I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.” [Politico]
20 percent
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) For many men, denim is an everyday staple of their wardrobe. When summer calls for a business casual approach that’s ideal for the office and a weekend out, the denim you choose should have that premium look without sacrificing comfort. Jeans featuring Mercer denim with a 20 percent stretch factor, like these twill denim jeans, are perfect for those situations.
85 percent uptick in signups
Yesterday was Prime Day, Amazon’s Black Friday-esque sales event for subscribers to its Prime service. But beyond a gimmick, the event is key to Amazon’s future. Last year, signups to its premium Prime service jumped 85 percent on Prime Day compared to the average day, and Prime is “the main defensive moat for the company’s retail business.” [Recode]
292 crocodiles
In an Indonesian village, a man was killed by a crocodile. In response, some 600 of his fellow countrymen gathered shovels, hammers, clubs, ropes, machetes and hoes and went out and killed 292 crocodiles, amassing them in a bloody pile. It’s unclear whether the crocodile that killed the man was among the dead. [The Washington Post]
14,400-year-old bread
14,400-year-old evidence of bread-making was discovered in northeastern Jordan recently. It was previously thought that, historically speaking, the making of bread followed the development of agriculture. But a new discovery shows that bread actually predates agriculture by about 4,000 years. These ancient bakers are thought to have used “wild einkorn and club-rush tubers to make flatbread-like food products.” Countdown to the introduction of $18 wild einkorn flatbreads on the menus of Brooklyn eateries in 5, 4, 3, 2, … [Gizmodo]
$155 million
Over the past three years, the family firm of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, sold apartments in one building in Brooklyn for a total of $155 million. These apartments had been rent stabilized, but nearly 75 percent of the building was sold or emptied in an effort to turn it into luxury condos. This was accomplished, current and former residents told the Associated Press, through a relentless campaign of construction and rent hikes meant to drive out residents. The construction drowned out conversation, rattled pictures off walls, and gave an invitation for rats to enter through holes in walls, according to a lawsuit filed by tenants. They also allege carcinogenic dust flowed into apartments and coated beds and clothes. [AP]
1 quadrillion tons of diamond
There may be more than a quadrillion (with a q) tons of diamond buried more than 100 miles below the Earth’s surface, a fact discovered thanks to a quirk in seismic data. But in the absence of a Technodrome Krang drill or some new Elon Musk fever dream, these diamonds are buried too deep to be reached anytime soon. [MIT]

$137.5 million for five years
Jimmy Garoppolo, the San Francisco 49ers’ quarterback, is the NFL’s most expensive lottery ticket, my colleagues wrote yesterday. Based on just five starts worth of work last season, he’s now set to earn $137.5 million over five years. It’s the most money earned by a player at the position based on such a small sample of play. Sure, they were five good starts that led to five wins, but just how good is a matter of some statistical debate. [FiveThirtyEight]
$30
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) For many men, a simple t-shirt goes a long way, but not all t-shirt manufacturers think in terms of style and variety. Fortunately, a brand that boasts to offer the “softest and most stylish clean tees available on the internet” just added five new and unique t-shirt colors to their extensive list of options. At just $30 each, many men will see this as a prime opportunity to expand their t-shirt-day options.
2.4 million subscribers
Google’s YouTube, following similar actions by Apple, Facebook and Spotify, terminated the page of Infowars’ Alex Jones for “violating YouTube’s Community Guidelines,” reportedly related to hate speech and harassment. Jones had 2.4 million subscribers on the video service. YouTube had previously levied punishment against Jones in July, citing “child endangerment and hate speech.” [TechCrunch]
15 percent of victims
From the Department of Seriously Come On Enough Already, a new and scary tick species is invading the United States. It’s called the Asian long-horned tick — aka the bush tick, aka the cattle tick — and it has been found in seven eastern states. In Asia, this particular species “carries a virus that kills 15 percent of its victims,” according to the Times. [The New York Times]
+4.45 percent on the day
Facebook stock, which was still hurting from the Cambridge Analytica data scandal and took a further historic nosedive in value last month, recovered somewhat on the news that the company had … asked large American banks to “share detailed financial information about their customers, including card transactions and checking-account balances.” Capitalism, boy, I dunno. [The Wall Street Journal]
31 Michelin stars
Joël Robuchon, the most Michelin-decorated chef in history and the “Chef of the Century,” died on Monday at the age of 73. His most famous recipe was for “the humble mashed potato,” the BBC reports. It is said to be half potato and half butter. I will prepare it tonight in his honor. [BBC]
60 taste testers
Ferrero, the maker of Nutella and Ferrero Rocher chocolates, is hiring 60 taste testers to taste cacao, hazelnut and chocolate products. Come with me, and you’ll be in a world of pure imagination. Take a look, and you’ll see into your imagination. We’ll begin with a spin traveling in the world of my creation. What we’ll see will defy explanation. [CBS News]

1,400 premature deaths annually
The Trump administration revealed its new coal-plant pollution rules yesterday. The document, the so-called Affordable Clean Energy rule, acknowledges that the plan would increase pollution and lead to 1,400 premature deaths a year. [The New York Times]
35 percent
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) A great receiver in football has the ability to stretch the field. A great pair of jeans has the ability to stretch and provide maximum comfort. You’ll want to go deep in these premium jeans, meaning you’ll never want to take them off. Ideal for both active wear and lounging, you’ll feel the difference in this high quality blend of cotton, polyester and elastane that creates a special formulation for 35% stretch denim. This dynamic stretch technology yields a denim that is double the stretch of our standard stretch jeans, and will have you luxuriating in unmatched comfort and flexibility.
8 counts; 8 counts
In New York yesterday, Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer and “fixer,” pleaded guilty to eight felony charges including tax evasion and making an illegal campaign contribution. And, literally meanwhile, in Alexandria, Virginia, Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, was found guilty on eight of 18 tax and bank fraud charges (a mistrial was declared in the other 10). [Bloomberg, CNN]
About 250 protesters
About 250 protesters at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill tore down Silent Sam, a Confederate statue on campus. The statue was erected in 1913 in remembrance of “sons of the University who died for their beloved Southland 1861-1865.” [CNN]
71 percent of Russians
According to a new Pew Research Center survey, 71 percent of Russians say the Russian government did not try to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Whelp, I guess that settles it. Everybody can go home now. [Pew Research Center]
At least 40 days of campaign-related travel
President Trump has a busy schedule ahead. He has at least 40-days of campaign travel planned through Election Day, which is 76 days away. The Hill reports that the schedule will begin by focusing on Senate races, while the particulars of House races continue to shake out. [The Hill]
16.1 percent of those voting without ID
With the midterms soon upon us, FiveThirtyEight contributor Dan Hopkins wrote a useful literature review yesterday of what we know about voter ID laws. Among many other findings, one recent study showed that black voters made up 11.4 percent of those voting in Texas in 2016 with ID and 16.1 percent of those voting without ID — clear evidence of a disparate racial impact of ID requirements.

Category 4
Hurricane Florence has intensified into a Category 4 storm and is currently churning across the Atlantic. Its biggest impact on the U.S. coast is expected to come Thursday and Thursday night, and the area from the Carolinas to Virginia is at greatest risk. A hurricane watch is expected to be issued for the southeastern coast this morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. [The Weather Channel]
4 ways
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) A typical pair of jeans derives comfort using a 2-way stretch design that works horizontally. One denim brand decided to add an extra dimension to their way of thinking, and introduced these 4-way stretch jeans that work in both vertical and horizontal directions, allowing for maximum mobility and comfort.
$5 footlong
I’m really very sorry to get that godawful jingle stuck in your head so early in the day, but pour out a fountain soda for Subway’s $5 Footlong deal, which is not long for this world. Subway franchisees were reportedly “irate” at the deal’s reintroduction over the winter, citing razor-thin margins on the sandwiches. The franchisees themselves will now get to decide whether or not to offer the deal. Hell hath no fury like a Subway franchisee scorned. [USA Today]
15 EGOT winners
Only 15 people have ever EGOTed — that is, won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. Three new EGOTers were created over the weekend at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards: John Legend, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, all of whom won for a production of “Jesus Christ Superstar.” (And there I go sticking more songs in your head.) Legend is the first African-American man to win all four awards. [CNN]
Up 86 percent
Money and politics, my colleague Maggie Koerth-Baker writes, have a complicated love affair. And the money is currently flying. Ad volumes in 2018 are up 86 percent compared to the midterm election in 2014. But the relationship between spending and winning is complicated. The candidate spending more usually wins, but that doesn’t mean the money caused the win. Why? All those ads don’t really work that well. [FiveThirtyEight]
More than 1,100 pardons
As his time in office winds down, California Gov. Jerry Brown recently commuted the sentences of 20 killers serving life sentences. Brown has also pardoned more than 1,100 people. For comparison, his predecessors, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gray Davis, granted 15 and zero pardons, respectively. Brown’s supporters see the pardons and commutations as a small victory in a fight against mass incarceration, while his detractors argue it bolsters California’s image as an “offender-friendly state.” [The Washington Post]
2,825 independent video rental stores
Much of my youth and adolescence (and, who are we kidding, young adulthood) was (mis)spent in or adjacent to video rental stores. The carpet, candy, surly staff and the, shall we say, “socializing” in the parking lot combined to create an experience that I argue cannot adequately be replaced by streaming “A Christmas Prince” on Netflix. Alas, I weep for the young. There were 8,500 independent video stores a decade ago; there were 2,825 last year. (The chain stores have similarly disappeared.) Three of those remaining indie stores are in Seattle, and this is a lovely paean to them. [The Seattle Times]

$765,000 at auction
It’s Nobel Prize season; fresh prizes are being announced this week and next. The world also lost a former winner this week. Leon Lederman, who won his Nobel in physics for “the neutrino beam method” in 1988 and coined the phrase “God particle,” died on Wednesday at the age of 96. When he won the award, he used the prize money to buy a log cabin. In 2015, he sold his prize at auction for $765,000 to help pay his medical bills. [Associated Press]

(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) For many men, denim is an everyday staple of their wardrobe. When the setting calls for a business casual approach to your dress, the denim you choose should have that premium look without sacrificing comfort. These twill denim jeans are constructed with Mercer denim featuring a 20 percent stretch factor and come in a variety of colors, fits and washes, making them an ideal choice for business casual events or for everyday wear.
7 Russian military spies
The Justice Department indicted seven Russian military spies yesterday on charges related to hacking and the Olympics. Olympic athletes’ drug tests were allegedly hacked and leaked in apparent retaliation against exposés of Russian doping. [The Washington Post]
$5 billion in fundraising
The University of Michigan has just finished an enormous fundraising effort which raked in some $5 billion. The school calls it the most ever for a public school. But others, such as the state universities of Washington, Florida, North Carolina and Illinois, are close behind, raking in their own billions. Funding cuts have eroded universities’ abilities to rely mainly on taxpayer dollars and tuition. Which, given what I still owe in tuition, is bonkers. [The Wall Street Journal]
25 percent chance at the title
Alabama is once again the favorite to win the college football title. The (public) school has a 25 percent chance to take it all, according to our just-released college football predictions. Ohio State, Georgia, Clemson and Oklahoma round out our Top 5. Texas, my grad school alma mater, is deep down the list with a “<1%” chance. Hook ’em? [FiveThirtyEight]
21,000 pieces of trackable space debris
Unexpected side effect of climate change, No. 12,482: Carbon dioxide emissions increase the chance of satellite collisions. There are some 21,000 piece of trackable debris floating in a metal cloud around our planet. The buildup of carbon dioxide cools a specific layer of the upper atmosphere where satellites often orbit. This coolness preserves whatever’s floating there, which otherwise may have fallen into the lower atmosphere and burnt up. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on. [Scientific American]
550 to 793
Thanks to a very old board game called hnefatafl, aka Viking chess, researchers may have pinpointed the earliest known cases of whaling in Scandinavia. Members of a culture called Vendel, who lived just before the Vikings, around the years 550 to 793, loved the game. (In the game, one player’s pieces and king begin in the center, while the other player besets them from four sides.) In the sixth century, its pieces — which had earlier been stone, antler or reindeer bone — started to be made out of whale bone, the key piece of evidence for the scientists. [Smithsonian]

2-mile test tunnel
Elon Musk’s digging enterprise, called the Boring Company (har har), is scheduled to open a 2-mile test tunnel underneath the Los Angeles area on Dec. 10. It’s a test for an underground public transportation system in which people and cars will travel on autonomous platforms called “skates.” Alternatively, and hear me out here because this is pretty damn radical, someone could just fix the subway. You know, that system of tunnels underneath New York City in which people travel on enclosed platforms called “trains.” [The Verge]
12 gauge
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) People tend to wait for temperatures to drop before breaking out the sweaters, but some sweaters don’t have to be reserved exclusively for “sweater season.” As winter approaches, stock up on sweaters that offer looser tension and a seasonless weight, like these incredibly soft 12 gauge crewneck sweaters made of 100% grade A cashmere, which can be layered over a button-down on cooler days or worn on their own when temperatures start climbing again.
2,990 body cameras
A Vievu-brand LE-5 body camera worn by a New York City police officer burst into flames Saturday, and now the department is taking 2,990 of the cameras out of service. The department was planning to outfit its 23,000 patrol officers with the cameras by December under a multimillion-dollar contract with Vievu. [The New York Times]
$12,600 to $18,900
The auction house Christie’s is scheduled to sell 22 items that belonged to the late physicist Stephen Hawking, including his doctoral thesis, a bomber jacket, a script from his appearance on “The Simpsons” and a wheelchair that he used from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. The wheelchair is estimated to sell for between $12,600 and $18,900. [CNBC]
800,000 pounds of food
Some 800,000 pounds of “ready-to-eat meat and poultry” have been recalled from the stores Trader Joe’s and Harris Teeter (who I presume was Joe’s archrival when it came to, like, trading). “Ready-to-eat” is a fairly big misnomer here because the foodstuffs were potentially contaminated with salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes, which you definitely do not want to ever eat. Relatedly: Do not dress up your chicken for Halloween. [Fortune]
197 million now
My colleague Perry Bacon Jr. has the latest update on the midterms, this one about governors races. The number of people forecast to be governed by Democrats has ticked up a few million, to 197 million, in the latest runs of our model. The biggest news was out of the Last Frontier that is Alaska, where Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, suspended his campaign and endorsed Democratic candidate Mark Begich, a former senator. [FiveThirtyEight]
$2 billion in debt
Netflix plans to turn to the debt market to raise $2 billion to fund more of its original programming. Fantastic news, honestly. Just imagine how many episodes of “VeggieTales in the City” and “VeggieTales in the House” and other types of VeggieTales tales I can’t even think of right now that you could buy with that kind of cash. A lot, is what I’m getting at. [TechCrunch]

43 hours
President Trump’s 43-hour stay in Paris was fraught. As the Washington Post reports, he “brooded” over midterm recounts in Florida, “sulked” over Democratic victories elsewhere, “erupted” at his staff following the media’s coverage of his decision to skip a ceremony honoring World War I veterans, was “resentful” about Emmanuel Macron’s censure of nationalism, and all the while was “plotting a shake-up” of his own administration. I went to Paris once. It was fine. Mostly I got tired, as the ignorant American I am, of asking people if they spoke English. [The Washington Post]
4 styles
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Finding the perfect pair of jeans can be tricky. Sometimes the color is right, but the style is off. Or the fit is right, but the material just isn’t comfortable. Fortunately, one brand found a solution. They offer comfortable, fairly priced jeans handcrafted from the highest quality materials in 4 different styles, and their free home try-on program takes the guesswork out of the style decision.
$50 million diamond
Listen up folks, because this is not a drill: There’s a new per-carat world record for the price of a pink diamond. Seriously. Stop looking at me like that. I know what you’re thinking, “Blah blah blah if I had a nickel for every time I heard …” Well, just stop it. Because this is the real deal. Christie’s sold the nearly 19-carat “Pink Legacy” diamond for $50 million. That’s $2.5 million per carat or something. [CBS News]
20,667 breathalyzer tests
Some 20,667 drunk driving convictions in New Jersey may be thrown out. The New Jersey Supreme Court found that the breathalyzer tests used to secure those convictions were inadmissible. That ruling was the result of charges against a state police sergeant “who was accused of falsifying calibration records on breath test devices” in a number of counties in that state. [The New York Times]
$32,000 in unpaid work
Matthew Whitaker, the acting Attorney General, used to work in private business in Iowa. There, he once “walked away from a taxpayer-subsidized apartment-rehabilitation project.” The city of Des Moines withdrew a loan to Whitaker’s company, and he was foreclosed upon after defaulting on another $700,000 loan. Contractors on the project filed liens seeking recompense for over $32,000 in unpaid work. [Associated Press]
7 percent drop
Oil prices have dropped some 7 percent — to their lowest levels in over eight months. Brent crude was down almost 7 percent, and West Texas intermediate was down more than 7 percent. The drops followed OPEC’s reducing its forecast for global oil demand. [BBC]
$2 billion in tax incentives
Amazon has announced New York and Virginia as its chosen sites for its second headquarters, or “HQ2” — never mind the mangled fact that these are not close to one another and at the very least it’s HQ2 and HQ3, or something similarly stupid. More pertinent is the fact that New York, yours truly apparently included, is paying Amazon $1.2 billion in tax incentives. We — meaning New York — have also apparently agreed to secure Jeff Bezos “access to a helipad.” Jeff, listen, because I’m paying for your gaudy lifestyle: You take the broken-ass subway for a month, and I’ll take the helicopter. After that, I’ll take you out for a beer at a good New York place, on me, we’ll exchange notes on commutes, and go from there. Deal? [The New York Times]

$1.8 billion
Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, is giving $1.8 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University. The gift is apparently the largest college donation in modern times and is meant to make the school’s admission process “forever need-blind.” [The Washington Post]

(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Upgrade your wardrobe without burning a hole in your pocket. This holiday season save big by identifying the best Black Friday sales and taking full advantage. One brand is offering 35 percent off their already great prices sitewide. Benefit from lower prices on everything from button downs and tees to jeans and cashmere sweaters. These once-a-year deals disappear quickly. Once you spot one, act fast before you miss out.
7 games, 7 draws
The World Chess Championship this year is a best-of-12-game match between the Norwegian Magnus Carlsen and American challenger Fabiano Caruana. Thus far, after the first seven games in London, each game has been a draw, and the match is level in points. Should the 12 games end tied, “rapid” and possibly “blitz” tie-breaking games would ensue, and if those are tied, the match will be decided in a chess format called “Armageddon.” [FiveThirtyEight]
More than 10,500 homes
The “Camp Fire” in California has now destroyed more than 10,500 homes. It has killed at least 77 people — the deadliest American wildfire in a century. [Associated Press]
536 A.D.
Take solace, fellow living humans: According to some scientists, 536 was the worst year ever to be alive. It was what used to be called the Dark Ages, and a “mysterious fog” darkened entire continents day and night. That fog is now thought to have been caused by a volcanic eruption in Iceland. A plague in Europe followed a few years after, and things were just really nasty all around. Plus, “A Christmas Prince” wasn’t even available yet on Netflix. In any case, I eagerly await 2018’s ranking when the dust settles. [Science]
2 centimeters across
Wombats are the only animal known to drop cubic poop. Each piece is about 2 centimeters across, and wombats collect 80 to 100 poops in a night. They then strategically place them “around their domain” to mark their territory and attract mates. The cubic nature of the poop is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation, improving “stackability” and making the poops less likely to roll away. [Gizmodo]
2.5 percent of children
Some 2.5 percent of American children may have a peanut allergy. Now, an experimental drug derived from peanuts and called AR101 may be able to protect some children from their life-threatening allergies. It has yet to be approved for sale, but a study funded by the drug company Aimmune found that two-thirds of the children taking AR101 could ingest the equivalent of about two whole peanut kernels while experiencing “no more than mild symptoms,” compared with only 4 percent of children in the placebo group.

$0.006 object
You know how when you get a container of sushi and it has that thin green plastic thing in it that sort of looks like grass? It’s a modern continuation of a centuries-old tradition. People used to use orchid or lily leaves in bento boxes to separate the foods’ flavors and smells. The modern versions come in boxes of 1,000 that cost up to $6 — a useful, $0.006 object! [The New York Times]
14 prototypes
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Quality shirts aren’t built in a day. From shirt length to button placement, every detail needs to be taken into consideration. It took 14 prototypes to create these shirts, which eliminate constraint via a well-placed bottom button and can be worn tucked or untucked thanks to carefully thought-out shirt lengths.
412 arrests
Thousands of demonstrators known as “Yellow Jackets,” protesting “rising gas taxes and the high cost of living,” took to the streets of Paris over the weekend. French officials were considering a state of emergency as the protests turned violent — rioters smashed windows, torched cars and tagged the Arc de Triomphe with graffiti. Some 130 people were injured and 412 were arrested. [NBC News]
$4.1 billion acquisition
Something called Nexstar Media Group has reached a deal to buy Tribune MediaCo for $4.1 billion, sources told Reuters. The deal would make the company the largest regional American television station operator. “Television” … I haven’t heard that name in years. [Reuters]
10 teams in 5 seasons
The College Football Playoff quartet was announced yesterday — Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame and Oklahoma will play for the title. (Not all at once, though that would be cool.) The four-team playoff system is five years old now. Alabama has appeared in every one, Clemson in four, Oklahoma in three and Notre Dame now in one. Ten teams in total have now been selected for the playoffs. [ESPN]
76 million miles from Earth
At around noon Eastern today, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is scheduled to arrive at an asteroid called Bennu, a week after its InSight craft landed on Mars. OSIRIS-REx (very cool name) launched more than two years ago; Bennu is some 76 million miles from Earth. The plan is for OSIRIS-REx to spend a year surveying and mapping the asteroid, then suck up some asteroid pebbles and dust with a robotic arm, and then return to Earth with that bounty in the fall of 2023. Godspeed, you eight-foot metal cube. [NBC News]
19 out of 20 world leaders agree
World leaders have been assembled in Buenos Aires for the G20 meeting. Nineteen of those leaders reaffirmed their support for the Paris agreement and their commitment to fighting climate change. One — President Trump — did not. “The United States reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and affirms its strong commitment to economic growth and energy access and security, utilizing all energy sources and technologies, while protecting the environment,” reads the G20 leaders’ declaration.

17 (known) investigations
It’s hard to keep track of them all, but Wired has put together a guide: There are 17 known investigations related to President Trump. That includes seven by the special counsel Robert Mueller, four by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, one by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, two by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and three by New York City, New York State or other state attorneys general. [Wired]
2 sizes
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Finding the perfect outfit can be tricky, especially when you’re shopping for someone else. Maybe you’ve found a style that you know they’ll love, but you’re not sure which size to get. Or you found the perfect fit, but the material just isn’t comfortable. Fortunately, one premium brand’s free home try-on program can alleviate the stress brought about by all the guesswork. Their program allows shoppers (or gift recipients) to try on 2 sizes of purchased apparel in the convenience of their own home. They’re also offering free 2-day shipping through Dec. 19 on all orders over 150 dollars, which means there is still time to shop before the holidays.
187 million interactions
According to a Senate Intelligence Committee report, Instagram “was a significant front” in Russian election meddling, eclipsing even Facebook itself. Between 2015 and 2018, there were 187 million interactions with Instagram content from the Internet Research Agency, the Russian trolling operation, compared with 77 million interactions on Facebook and 73 million on Twitter. [Bloomberg]
71 percent of bill collectors
Google Image searches for professions return results that can misrepresent, in some cases grossly, the actual gender breakdown of people who work those jobs in the real world. For example, 71 percent of real-world bill collectors are women, whereas only 20 percent of the images in a search for “bill collectors” are of women. A similar gap holds for bartenders, probation officers and chief executives. Women are overrepresented in searches for singers and models. [Pew Research Center]
$2.7 billion in fines
Malaysia filed criminal charges against the bank Goldman Sachs yesterday, accusing the company of “making false and misleading statements.” Malaysia is seeking more than $2.7 billion in fines. The charges are related to an investment fund called 1MDB, funds from which bank executives are suspected of using for personal shopping sprees that included diamonds and Picassos. [The New York Times]
46 airstrikes
The U.S. military carried out six airstrikes in Somalia earlier this month, which killed 62 people, it said. They were an effort to thwart a “major extremist attack,” according to Somali intelligence. The U.S. has carried out at least 46 airstrikes there this year, a number that has increased dramatically since President Trump took office. [Associated Press]
16 teams
The draw for the 16 teams left in soccer’s Champions League was held yesterday. Among other round-of-16 fixtures, Manchester United will play Paris Saint-Germain, Tottenham Hotspur will play Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool will play Bayern Munich. According to FiveThirtyEight’s projections, Manchester City is the favorite to win it all at 19 percent, followed by Barcelona at 14 percent and PSG at 11 percent. [FiveThirtyEight]

‘Less than 50-50’
President Trump pegged the chances that a new group of 17 House and Senate members would be able to forestall another government shutdown by crafting a deal in the next three weeks at “less than 50-50.” [The Wall Street Journal]
4 product categories
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) For many men, a t-shirt, a button down and a pair of jeans go a long way, but not all manufacturers think in terms of style and variety. Fortunately, one brand offers numerous options across 4 product categories. Their premium denim comes in 3 fits and over 10 washes, their button downs come in 4 colors and 2 styles with 2 collar options. And their tees, which they say are the “softest tees you will ever wear,” come in 2 sleeve lengths and 10 colors. With this many possibilities, it won’t be hard to put together a seemingly unlimited number of outfit options for work, weekends and more.
$3 billion lost
The five-week government shutdown cost $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO projected that $8 billion of that will be recouped during the rest of this year, while $3 billion will never be seen or heard from again. [Politico]
84 percent of firms
The White House hoped its huge $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which reduced the corporate tax rate, would “boost business spending and job growth.” However, 84 percent of respondents to a poll from the National Association of Business Economics said that the package “has not caused their firms to change hiring or investment plans.” There were exceptions: Fifty percent of goods-producing respondents did say that they’d increased investment. [Reuters]
More than 70 percent of House members
The House of Representatives is, ostensibly, representative. I mean, it’s in the name. But its members tend to follow specific and elite career paths before joining the body. More than 70 percent of current House members, for example, were lawyers in private practice, businesspeople or medical professionals. As a result, the House is “much, much richer than the people it represents.” [The New York Times]
3 dead, 172 hurt
A rare tornado — the first in decades, apparently caused by a cold front hitting Cuba’s northern coast — touched down in Havana. The Category F3 storm, with winds between 155 and 199 miles per hour, killed at least three people and injured 172. [Associated Press]
41 days
Yesterday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders held her first press briefing in 41 days. The gap was the longest in the history of the administration. President Trump had told Sanders “not to bother” with the briefings. [Fox News]

16 states
Sixteen states are filing a lawsuit to challenge President Trump’s declaration of national emergency: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Virginia. [ABC News]
18 percent
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) How do you make a truly comfortable pair of jeans? Jeans made out of cotton are often soft, but may not stretch well. Jeans made out of materials that offer more elasticity aren’t always as soft as their mostly-cotton counterparts. Fortunately, one brand solved the conundrum. They’ve developed weaving technology to produce jeans that are 99% cotton and only 1% elastane while still providing an 18% stretch factor. The jeans maintain their shape and look great, and are likely more comfortable than any other pair of jeans that you own.
304 candidates
There’s one prize with even more candidates in the mix than the Democratic presidential nomination. The Nobel Committee said that it had received 304 nominations — 219 individuals and 85 organizations — for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize. One of those individuals is President Trump, who was reportedly nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers “for the positive developments on the Korean Peninsula.” The committee, however, keeps the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees secret for 50 years. [Reuters]
At least 336 chemical attacks
A study from researchers at the Global Public Policy Institute counted at least 336 chemical weapons attacks — including chlorine gas, sarin and sulfur mustard gas — since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, and they suspect the true figure may be higher still. President Bashar Assad’s regime was responsible for 98 percent of them, the study found, and the Islamic State was responsible for 2 percent. [NPR]
8.4 metric tons of waste
China has indefinitely closed its Mount Everest base camp to tourists, citing the trash. During the last climbing season, the Tibet Autonomous Region Sports Bureau said it collected 8.4 metric tons of waste, including garbage and human waste. [ABC News]
Nearly 26 years ago
Jerry Westrom wiped his mouth with a napkin at a hockey game and threw it in the trash. And then he was arrested for murder. Authorities had used the services of a genealogy website to identify Westrom as a suspect in a 1993 killing in Minneapolis, and then used DNA from the napkin to arrest him. Westrom denies involvement. “The tactic has also raised ethical concerns,” writes the Times, as those who use genealogy services might not know that it could help police track down their relatives. [The New York Times]
12 franchises
The NBA and the International Basketball Federation are partnering to create the Basketball Africa League, which will launch with 12 teams in January 2020. Qualifications tournaments will be held this year to determine which existing African club teams will join the league, with teams from Angola, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia expected to participate.

30 years old
Happy birthday to the World Wide Web, which has turned 30 years old. “It would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next 30 [years],” its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, said. Here’s hoping. [NBC News]
9 GG
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) When shopping for a new sweater, material matters. Cotton and wool are good places to start, but even those materials can differ across brands. One often-overlooked stat is the “gauge,” or GG of the fabric. The higher the GG, the finer the sweater will be. The Liam Coverstitch Crew Sweater, which is 70 percent cotton and 30 percent wool, is made from 9 GG material and features a coverstitch that gives it a more casual look, making it the perfect year-round alternative to a typical sweatshirt.
17 percent less air pollution
Just as there is dramatic wealth inequality in the U.S., there is also dramatic pollution inequality. According to a new study in PNAS, white people experience 17 percent less air pollution than they produce through their consumption. Black and Hispanic people, however, experience about 56 and 63 percent more than they produce, respectively. [NPR]
687 deputies
North Korea held an “election” this week, sending 687 deputies to the Supreme People’s Assembly. However, only one candidate, approved by the state, appeared on each ballot. In a first, Kim Jong Un did not appear on any ballots at all. Experts said that this was not a weakening of power but rather an attempt to appear more democratic, as the president does not also sit in parliament in most “normal states.” [BBC]
50 people
Fifty people have been charged as part of the FBI’s so-called Operation Varsity Blues for their alleged roles in “a long-running bribery scheme” to guarantee privileged children’s admission to top colleges and universities. The scheme allegedly involved money bribes, cheating on entrance exams, and pretending children were athletes when they were not. The schools involved included Georgetown, Yale, Stanford, the University of Texas, the University of Southern California and UCLA. Those charged include the television actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin. [The Washington Post]
$159,000 minimum salary
The musicians of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra went on strike this week in a dispute over their pension plan which has lasted for nearly a year. The Chicago players are some of the best-paid in the business, making an annual salary of at least $159,000 “and often more.” As ticket sales have fallen, orchestras have been forced to try to cut costs and rely more heavily on donors. [The New York Times]
3 Orioles
The current incarnation of the Baltimore Orioles is one of the most anonymous teams in the history of Major League Baseball, my colleague Neil Paine writes. To wit, only three members of the team’s lineup have even two years of MLB service time, and they are “average players at best.” Beyond that, only three teams had lower WAR levels for their Opening Day starters than the Orioles will have this season. [FiveThirtyEight]

“15 to 30 minutes”
The Notre Dame cathedral in Paris was “15 to 30 minutes” away from complete destruction when it was ablaze on Monday, according to French authorities. The monument of Gothic architecture was saved thanks to the work of the Paris fire brigade. French president Emmanuel Macron said in a television address that he wanted the cathedral rebuilt — “more beautiful than before” — within five years. [The Guardian]
20 percent
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) For many men, denim is an everyday staple of their wardrobe. When the setting calls for a business casual approach to your dress, the denim you choose should have that premium look without sacrificing comfort. These jeans are made from an incredibly smooth Mercer twill denim featuring a 20 percent stretch factor. They come in a variety of fits, washes and colors, including a new Olive Green, making them an ideal choice for business casual events or for everyday wear.
27,000 NBA games
Who among us hasn’t wondered to what extent the first team to score 100 points usually wins an NBA game? That’s precisely the question the Los Angeles Times sought to answer with a database of 27,000 such games. Indeed that team does — 94 percent of the time. But this 100-point near certainty — dubbed Lawler’s Law after Clippers announcer Ralph Lawler — has become less certain as the number of 100-point games has skyrocketed. [Los Angeles Times]
1965
For decades, plastic has been increasingly common in the ocean — marine animals become entangled in plastic and microplastics have been found in fish, on the seafloor and in Antarctic ice. Now marine biologists believe they may have identified the earliest ever instance of plastic pollution in the ocean, a plastic bag caught in a continuous plankton recorder off the coast of Ireland in 1965. [BBC]
135 miles offshore
Workers on an oil rig 135 miles off the coast of southern Thailand spotted a dog in the increasingly rough waters. They secured the dog with a rope, hauled him to safety, gave him water, fed him meat and set up a kennel. His being in the sea was largely a mystery, but he may have fallen from a fishing trawler. They named him Boonrod. [NPR]
$119.5 million raised
Cash rules everything around me, including campaigns for the American presidency. Candidates must file detailed reports about their fundraising and spending, which are made public by the Federal Election commission, and which are, now, turned into a FiveThirtyEight interactive feature. We’ve broken down who has the most cash, and where it’s come from, be it big donors, small donors or self funding. All told, the Democratic field has raised $119.5 million combined while President Trump has raised $30.3 million. [FiveThirtyEight]
5.5 percent
Speaking of candidates and cash, the Washington Post examined the 2020 candidates’ tax returns and analyzed their levels of charitable giving — what the Post calls “a meaningful metric of their values and priorities.” Elizabeth Warren was the most generous of the “top-tier” candidates who have released their tax returns; she and her husband donated 5.5 percent of their income last year. The comparable number for Bernie Sanders was 3.4 percent. Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar each came in at between 1 and 2 percent. Beto O’Rourke gave 0.3 percent. [The Washington Post]

80 “regular citizens”
The parking situation in Washington, D.C., is so bad that there is a proposal in front of the city council there that would deputize 80 “regular citizens” to ticket vehicles parked illegally. Vigilante justice — I can see the comic book already. [The Washington Post]
12.4 ounces and 16 percent
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) When shopping for jeans, most people don’t pay too much attention to the weight or elasticity of the fabric, but both are key factors that affect comfort. Laight jeans are made of a pure indigo comfort denim that weighs only 12.4 ounces and boasts 16 percent elasticity, which makes for an ideal fit and feel. One brand is offering 20 percent off all washes of Laight jeans with promo code MEMDAY20, but the offer only lasts until May 28, so jump on it quickly.
1.4755214×10^40 photons
The kilogram has been officially redefined. No longer is its mass equal to that of the special platinum-iridium alloy cylinder locked in a vault beneath a building in Paris. Now it officially weighs the same as 1.4755214×10^40 photons, a type of elementary particle, with frequencies matching a cesium atomic clock. I do feel sorry for the cylinder, which is now just another nameless hunk of platinum-iridium alloy idling away in a Paris basement, a tale as old as time. [Motherboard]
7,000 jobs
Ford unveiled its restructuring plan yesterday. It’s preparing for a future of electric and autonomous vehicles, and plans to save $600 million a year by “eliminating bureaucracy and increasing the number of workers reporting to each manager.” The company will cut 7,000 white-collar workers in all, including 2,300 jobs in the U.S. through buyouts and layoffs. [Associated Press]
37 launches
More details of NASA’s Artemis moon program have been unveiled. It is slated to include 37 launches of NASA and private rockets over the next 10 years, both robotic and human landers, and a “Lunar Surface Asset Deployment” in 2028 which is “likely the beginning of a surface outpost for long-duration crew stays.” [Ars Technica]
0.63 dissimilarity index
My colleague Rachael Dottle built an interactive feature where you can look up where Democrats and Republicans live in your city. She writes that “almost every Democratic city has Republican enclaves, especially when you think about cities as more than just their downtowns. It’s a sign of our polarized times that these Republicans aren’t evenly distributed across the city, of course.” The most politically polarized city in the U.S. turns out to be Jackson, Mississippi, with a partisan dissimilarity index of 0.63. [FiveThirtyEight]
7 floors of stacks
There are seven “football-field-size floors of stacks,” absolute gobs of space in Midtown Manhattan, in the main building of the New York Public Library which sit empty — no books line their shelves. There used to be many books — including rare first editions — but they were removed in 2013. The space could not “adequately protect irreplaceable books from sunlight, heat and humidity,” according to library officials. [The New York Times]

Hundreds of thousands of people
Hundreds of thousands of people — 240,000 by the police’s reckoning and more than a million by the organizers’ — took to the streets of Hong Kong to protest a bill that would allow the government to extradite people to places with which Hong Kong has no formal extradition agreement, including mainland China. The bill’s critics argue that it would let China prosecute its political opponents in Hong Kong. [NPR]
11.5 ounces
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Chances are you have no idea how much your jeans weigh, but the weight of your jeans matters more than you think. For summer, lighter is obviously better, but how light is light? These jeans weigh in at just 11.5 ounces, and you’d be hard-pressed to find jeans that weigh much less. They’re also made out of a unique Stone fabric that boasts incredible softness, which adds an additional dimension to the overall comfort level of the jeans. First time customers get 15 percent off, so they’re definitely worth checking out as we head into the dog days.
12th title
Rafael Nadal won his 12th French Open title yesterday, defeating Dominic Thiem, in a rematch of last year’s final, 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1. No other tennis player has won a major tournament so often. Nadal now has 18 Grand Slam titles, two shy of Roger Federer’s men’s record of 20. [Associated Press]
$35,000 per night
NASA has announced that it will provide private citizens room and board on the International Space Station — for $35,000 a night. Add to that $18,000 per kilogram for round-trip travel and $17,500 an hour for the astronauts’ time (not including tips, presumably) and pretty soon you’re talking about real money for that space vacation. [The Washington Post]
$33 million
The 12th and apparently final X-Men movie, “Dark Phoenix,” earned just $33 million in its opening weekend at the domestic box office. That’s the worst debut of any X-Men picture, probably not helped by its 23 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes and the fact that it came on the heels of “Avengers: Endgame.” As a FiveThirtyEight writer, my favorite X-Man is Longshot, who has the power of probability field manipulation. [BuzzFeed News]
23 percent chance
The Women’s World Cup is now in full swing in France. The hosts, who beat South Korea 4-0 in their opener, are the championship favorites according to our forecasts, with a 23 percent chance at the title. Team USA, whose first game is Tuesday against Thailand, is second with a 17 percent chance, followed by Germany with an 11 percent chance. [FiveThirtyEight]
137 years
The Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been under construction — illegally — for 137 years. Last week, however, the Roman Catholic church received its building permit at least from the Barcelona city council. Bureaucracy, am I right? [CNN]

1 time in baseball history
For the first time in baseball history, a player has stolen first base. After an 0-1 pitch in a game on Saturday, Tony Thomas, an outfielder for the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs, took an advantage of a new rule adopted by the independent Atlantic League. The rule, which expands on the dropped-third-strike rule in place in the major leagues, lets batters steal first base if any pitch is not “caught in flight” by the catcher. Good hustle, Tony. [Deadspin]
12 colors
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Think about your favorite shirt. The one that’s not too slim and not too loose. The one you wish you could somehow wear over and over without repeating your look. The Driggs tee checks all of those boxes and more, and if it’s not already your favorite shirt, it will be once you try it on. Made from 100 percent combed cotton, the shirt is the perfect weight for summer and comes in 12 colors and two neck options, so you can stock up on a variety of different looks.
4 hours 57 minutes
Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer on Sunday fought an epic battle in England from which Djokovic emerged triumphant, 7-6 (5), 1-6, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 13-12 (3), securing his fifth Wimbledon title. At four hours and 57 minutes, it was the longest Wimbledon final ever. The match saw 68 games and 422 points — 218 for Federer and 204 for Djokovic. [ESPN]
3 of 4 congresswomen
On Sunday morning, President Trump tweeted that “‘Progressive’ Democrat Congresswomen” ought to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” Trump seems to have been referring to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar. All of them are American citizens, and three of the four congresswomen were born and raised in the United States. [CBS News]
More than 1,000 landscapes
For his television show, Bob Ross painted more than 1,000 landscapes, chockablock with happy trees and mountains. But try as you might, you can’t find them for sale — not at auctions, not in galleries, not online. So where are they? The Times set out to solve the mystery and — spoiler alert — they appear to be stacked in cardboard boxes in Herndon, Virginia, inside the nondescript offices of Bob Ross Inc. [The New York Times]
More than 550,000 people
More than 550,000 people — and counting — have RSVP’d to a Facebook event to “storm” Area 51. “Lets see them aliens,” the page’s description reads, along with a crude map and a “game plan.” Vox says, “This ridiculous ‘event’ is shitposting at its biggest and best.” [Vox]
30 blocks
If I was supposed to meet you on Saturday evening and never showed up, I’m very sorry — a power outage in New York City affected 73,000 customers in a 30-block stretch of Manhattan, and I was stuck in traffic-light-less traffic on the West Side Highway. The exact cause of the blackout, which came on the anniversary of the infamous 1977 outage, will reportedly not be known until an investigation is complete. What is known is that it took me 2.5 hours to get home. [The Associated Press]

Dallas-area U.S. Rep. Kenny Marchant announced yesterday that he would not seek reelection, becoming the 12th House Republican to step aside.

(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Chances are you have no idea how much your jeans weigh, but the weight of your jeans matters more than you think. For summer, lighter is obviously better, but how light is light? These jeans weigh in at just 10.6 ounces, and you’d be hard-pressed to find jeans that weigh much less. They also have a finishing that gives them incredible softness, which adds an additional dimension to the overall comfort level of the jeans. First time customers get 15 percent off, so they’re definitely worth checking out. They come in dark blue and a medium blue wash.
720,000 air purifiers
Last year, in the midst of the Camp wildfire in California, business at one retailer quintupled — Collier Hardware sold almost 60,000 breathing masks in just two weeks. Similarly, as the threat of wildfires continues and temperatures increase, overall demand for portable air purifiers in California is forecast to soar, from 469,000 of them in 2017 to 720,000 in 2023, according to data presented recently before the California Air Resources Board.

11-year low
China’s currency, the yuan, was dropped to its lowest levels in 11 years, bringing it “past a level that traders saw as an important psychological benchmark” (seven per $1). As a result, stocks dropped sharply on Monday, with investors worried about the economic damage that President Trump’s trade war would continue to wreak. [Associated Press]

$152,500
Nick Marchington, who made the final table of the World Series of Poker Main Event, went home with $1,525,000 in winnings. Now, he is being sued for $152,500 of it. A group called C Biscuit Poker Staking is arguing that they’d staked 10 percent of Marchington’s Main Event action and is seeking that cut. Marchington says he told them he was canceling the deal, in favor of a better one, and returning the investment before the Main Event began. [Card Player]
30 years
Two hundred million years ago, a dinosaur roamed the Earth. And for the past 30 years, its fossilized bones have been sitting in a museum collection at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. It was thought to have been “a peculiar specimen of Massospondylus, one of the first named dinosaurs.” However, new research suggests that it is not only a brand new species but also in a brand new genus. It is named Ngwevu intloko, Xhosa for “grey skull.” [The Guardian]

$2.5 trillion housing plan
Bernie Sanders introduced a $2.5 trillion affordable housing policy that seeks to expand public housing, increase affordable housing options and cap annual rent increases nationally. “For too long, this is one of those issues that we just don’t talk about,” Sanders told a group in Las Vegas. The Sanders campaign has not yet provided a proposal with more specific details, but intends to release more over the next month. [The New York Times]
4 styles
(Sponsored by Mott & Bow) Finding the perfect pair of jeans can be tricky. Sometimes the color is right, but the style is off. Or the fit is right, but the material just isn’t comfortable. Fortunately, one brand found a solution. They offer comfortable, fairly priced jeans handcrafted from the highest quality materials in 4 different styles, and their free home try-on program takes the guesswork out of the style decision.
$11 billion settlement
The last two years for Pacific Gas & Electric have gone from bad to worse. Now, slap an $11 billion settlement on top of intense public scrutiny and filing for bankruptcy. The embattled utilities company agreed to the settlement to reimburse insurance companies for claims filed after devastating California wildfires in 2017 and 2018. California officials blamed PG&E for causing most of the wildfires. One of them, the 2018 Camp Fire, is the deadliest in the state’s history and destroyed more than 10,000 homes. The company has already committed to paying an additional $1 billion to local governments and more to uninsured and under-insured fire victims. [The Sacramento Bee]

22 years missing
Turns out Google Earth can do a lot more than help you cyber stalk your crush. The remains of a Florida man missing for 22 years were discovered in a car sunken into a pond — thanks to Google Earth. A resident noticed the submerged vehicle in August while looking at satellite images of his neighborhood. Inside the car were the skeletal remains of a man identified as William Earl Moldt, who went missing in Nov. 1997 at the age of 40. The car had been visible on a Google Earth photo of the area since 2007, according to the Charley Project, a website that posts information about missing people. [New York Post]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-voters-are-largely-backing-trumps-withdrawal-from-syria/,2019-10-23,,,features,"Oct. 18, 2019",Republican Voters Are Largely Backing Trump’s Withdrawal From Syria,Dhrumil Mehta,FiveThirtyEight,The Trump Administration,"Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.
Poll of the week
On Sunday, Oct. 6, President Trump publicly called for withdrawal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria. Since then, as U.S. troops have hastily withdrawn from their position, Turkish, Russian, and Syrian government forces have advanced into the region. The American withdrawal has been met with bipartisan disapproval from Congress, where two-thirds of Republicans in the House voted with Democrats to condemn the president’s decision. Even some of Trump’s staunchest Republican allies opposed the move. South Carolina Senator Linsey Graham, who normally votes with the president, called the withdrawal a “stain on the honor of the United States.”
But while the measure has been unpopular among Republican lawmakers, rank-and-file members of the party may not be as opposed. There have only been four polls so far since Trump announced he would withdraw troops from Syria, and while all four showed that mainly Americans oppose the withdrawal, there was a stark partisan split — Republican voters aren’t broadly opposed to Trump’s decision.
First up, a YouGov/CBS News poll conducted Oct. 8-11 found that a plurality of Americans (41 percent) said they didn’t know enough about the situation to determine whether they supported removing troops from the region, while 24 percent approved of withdrawing troops and 34 percent disapproved of the move. But among Republicans, 41 percent approved of the decision to withdraw troops. (The majority of Democrats opposed it.)
A Morning Consult/Politico poll conducted Oct. 11-13 found that a 41 percent plurality of Americans opposed withdrawing troops, but unlike the YouGov/CBS News poll, this poll did not give respondents the option of saying they hadn’t heard enough to know how the felt. A majority of Republicans (56 percent) supported removing troops from the region, while the majority of Democrats (60 percent) opposed it.
A YouGov/Economist poll conducted Oct. 13-15 asked respondents whether they supported removing U.S. troops and “leaving Syrian Kurds who fought against ISIS vulnerable to attack from the Turkish military.” That poll found a majority (52 percent) of Americans were opposed. Seventy-six percent of Democrats opposed military withdrawal, but a majority of Republicans (57 percent) supported it.
And lastly, a USA Today/IPSOS poll conducted Oct. 16-17 asked respondents whether withdrawing troops was the right decision because “the U.S. has too many military commitments abroad” or the wrong decision because it will “upset stability in a dangerous region.” Twenty-seven percent said it was the right decision, while 37 percent said it was the wrong decision. A 41 percent plurality of Republicans thought withdrawal was the right decision while only 15 percent of Democrats said the same.
This isn’t the first time Trump has announced plans to remove troops from Syria. But the public wasn’t as opposed before. YouGov/Economist started asking Americans whether they’d support removing troops from Syria in April 2018 after Trump called for withdrawal. At that time, slightly more Americans were in favor (36 percent) than opposed (28 percent). And even after Trump called for the removal of troops again in December, Americans were still about evenly split (39 percent approved; 37 percent disapproved). But this time around, Trump’s decision to remove troops from the region is not as popular. As the table below shows, net support for withdrawing troops has decreased since last year, especially among Democrats and independents. But support among Republicans has stayed relatively high since December.

However, we don’t want to read too much into Republican support for Trump’s decision to remove troops from Syria. And that’s because many Americans are still getting up to speed on the situation. Remember, in that YouGov/CBS News poll, a plurality of Americans said they didn’t know enough to say whether they supported removing troops from the region. And according to that Morning Consult/Politico poll, 40 percent of registered voters had heard either “nothing at all” or “not much” about the Turkish offensive (including 45 percent of Republicans, and 34 percent of Democrats). A third of voters also said they have heard little or nothing about the U.S. troop pullout. And that USA Today/Ipsos poll also found that 42 percent of Americans — including 45 percent of Republicans — had either not heard about the U.S. decision to withdraw troops or knew little about it.
There are some early signs, though, that even as they learn more, Republican voters may not sour on Trump’s decision. The Morning Consult/Politico poll also conducted an “informed ballot” test to see whether respondents’ answers changed after they were presented with arguments from both sides. The pollster told respondents that opponents of Trump’s decision said it amounts to “abandoning the Kurds” and that it “could lead to ISIS gaining ground in the area,” and said supporters of the president argued that “it’s time to keep the U.S. out of foreign wars.” After being presented with this information, 60 percent of Republicans supported Trump’s decision to remove troops from Syria, a slight increase from the 56 percent who backed the move without being given these arguments first.
If Republican voters continue to support Trump’s position, though, Republican politicians may have to fall in line.
Other polling bites
Last week, Trump took aim at Fox News’s pollster after their latest poll showed results that were unfavorable to him, including growing support for impeachment. “Whoever their Pollster is, they suck,” he tweeted, following up again on Monday with another tweet calling the poll “incorrect.” His assessment appears to be based on an article from the New York Post that attributed the poll to Braun Research and attempted to re-weight the poll under the assumption that the partisan breakdown of respondents was not in line with real-world party affiliations. While Braun did conduct fieldwork for the poll, Fox News polls are conducted under the joint direction of a Democrat working for Beacon Research and a Republican with Shaw & Company Research, and they are among the more accurate polls around. Reweighting polls based on party identification, which has come to be known as “unskewing,” is generally a methodologically flawed way of interpreting polling data, and it has led to misleading results in the past.
A FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll, which asked respondents to rate each candidates’ debate performance on a four-point scale, found that Sen. Elizabeth Warren was ranked highest by those who watched the debate. But South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg saw the largest increase in the share of voters who were considering voting for him before and after the debate — an increase of 4.5 percentage points.
According to a poll from the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center, 57 percent of Americans either “strongly” or “somewhat” agree that the Supreme Court “gets too mixed up in politics.” A majority of Americans, however, still think that the court acts “in the best interests of the American people” and that it has “about the right amount of power.”
Over a quarter of American adults are now religiously unaffiliated, according to a Pew Research Center study, up from 17 percent in 2009.
According to a poll conducted last weekend by Public Policy Polling for the Chicago Sun-Times and ABC7 Chicago, 49 percent of Chicagoans either “strongly” or “somewhat” support a teachers strike, while 38 percent opposed it. The strike was announced Wednesday evening, and classes in Chicago were canceled as of Thursday.
A YouGov poll asked Americans about the NBA’s priorities in light of backlash from Chinese companies, following theHouston Rockets’ general manager Daryl Morey tweeting support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters. Two-thirds of respondents said the NBA should prioritize freedom of speech for its employees more, 8 percent said it should prioritize its business interests more, and about a quarter said they don’t know.
According to a recent poll from Siena College, a quarter of New Yorkers support a bill in the New York State legislature to divide New York State in two states. Two-thirds of New Yorkers said they oppose the bill. The bill stipulates that one of the two states would be New York City and the surrounding areas, while the other would be the remaining 53 counties in the state.
Bolivians go to the polls on Sunday to elect a president. In late 2017, the country’s highest court scrapped term limits altogether, paving the way for current president Evo Morales to run for his fourth consecutive term. In order to win in the first-round election, Morales must get above 40 percent of the vote and have a 10-point lead over his second-place rival. While Morales is leading, some recent polls have left him just shy of 40 percent, indicating that he may not be able to avoid a runoff election, but others have put him at just over the 40 percent mark.
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 41.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 54 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -12.4 points). At this time last week, 42.0 percent approved and 53.7 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -11.7 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 41.8 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.7 percent, for a net approval rating of -11.9 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.3 percentage points (46.6 percent to 40.3 percent). At this time last week, Democrats led by 6.1 percentage points (46.2 percent to 40.1 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.8 points (46.8 percent to 40 percent).

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-executive-privilege-protect-trump-in-the-impeachment-inquiry/,2019-10-23,,,features,"Oct. 23, 2019",Could Executive Privilege Protect Trump In The Impeachment Inquiry?,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,FiveThirtyEight,The Trump Administration,"One measure of the success or failure of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry will be just how much evidence they’re able to squeeze out of the Trump administration. There’s already a surprising amount of information out in the open about President Trump asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden’s son Hunter. But now House Democrats must figure out whether Trump’s actions are impeachable, which has meant pursuing information from a wide range of sources within the administration, from Vice President Mike Pence to heretofore unknown figures like European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland.
The White House is, to put it mildly, not on board. Earlier this month, White House lawyers sent the Democrats a fiery letter declaring that the executive branch would refuse to cooperate with the investigation in any way. Since then, other administration officials have also said they’ll refuse to cooperate — including some, like Defense Secretary Mike Esper and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who have said the information requested by the House is confidential and may be covered by executive privilege.
We’re likely to hear more about executive privilege over the coming weeks as the tug-of-war between the Trump administration and Congress escalates. And that’s because if you are a president trying to withhold information from other branches of government, claiming executive privilege is an obvious place to start. It’s a powerful but sometimes murky concept that allows presidents to shield certain information about goings-on in the West Wing from the public, the courts, and Congress. But it’s also not a limitless power. Just ask Richard Nixon, whose presidency came to an abrupt end after the Supreme Court ruled that he couldn’t use executive privilege to avoid turning over a set of incriminating White House tapes.
So if you find the whole concept of executive privilege mysterious (and you are surely not alone), here’s a quick crash course on what it is and how it could affect the impeachment inquiry.
What is executive privilege? How does it work?
Presidents talk about a lot of sensitive issues within the confines of the White House — matters of national security, for instance, are a big one. And there are plenty of legitimate reasons why a president wouldn’t want the contents of those conversations to be broadcast outside the Oval Office — if advisers had to worry that their counsel would be made public, it would be very hard to have candid internal discussions. Enter executive privilege. It’s a power that allows the executive branch to ignore Congress’s and the courts’ requests for some documents or testimony that’s related to either presidential communications or the process of creating government policy.
Where does this power come from? 
Executive privilege is not in the Constitution, but that hasn’t stopped pretty much every president from trying to keep information out of the hands of Congress. As a formal legal concept, though, it’s still relatively new. The term “executive privilege” was coined during the Eisenhower administration. It was first recognized by the Supreme Court as a legitimate presidential power in 1974 as part of the Watergate investigation — although ironically, the justices went on to conclude that even though executive privilege existed, it was not unlimited, so Nixon still couldn’t use it to avoid handing over the White House tapes to a court.
To be clear, there’s nothing inherently wrong with exercising a power that’s not explicitly spelled out in the Constitution. But executive privilege’s vague origins do mean that we tend to find out about its limitations only when a president tries to use it in a legally questionable way — which means there are many gray areas in how it can be used.
What have the courts said about executive privilege?
Surprisingly, not all that much. In the Nixon case, the justices were clear that executive privilege isn’t a literal get-out-of-jail free card, in that a president’s ability to use it to avoid handing damaging information over to a prosecutor is very limited. But they didn’t say much more than that, and haven’t ruled on it since.
Over the years, though, some limitations have been hashed out in a handful of lower court rulings and by the Department of Justice. For instance, experts told me there is broad agreement that only the president can invoke executive privilege, but he can still assert it to keep aides from testifying in some circumstances. However, the president can’t use it willy-nilly even if he’s dealing with Congress and not a criminal investigation. He generally has to have a good reason for withholding information, rather than simply refusing to share something because he doesn’t want Congress to have it. What that has meant in practice is that declaring an entire topic or category of people off-limits isn’t generally allowed.
How has Trump been using executive privilege?
So far, Trump hasn’t been extensively asserting executive privilege in response to House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. But administration figures like Pence who have claimed that they don’t have to cooperate because the entire inquiry is constitutionally illegitimate have also noted that executive privilege could be invoked later. And in House Democrats’ other investigations, Trump has been aggressive about his use of executive privilege, going so far as to claim it for people like former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who never worked in his administration. So it seems likely that Trump will be continue to assert it going forward.
If Congress challenges Trump’s privilege claim, who decides who wins?
In the past, a presidential assertion of executive privilege was the opening gambit in a long negotiation that often — although not always — ended with compromise. But if the president doesn’t want to give an inch, the courts have to weigh in.
But there’s still an element of gamesmanship to these disputes, as the legal process can take a very, very long time to resolve. For instance, a battle over documents related to a botched arms-trafficking operation conducted under the Obama administration ping-ponged through the courts for seven years. Needless to say, House Democrats do not want to wait anywhere near that long to make decisions about impeachment.
Granted, if there were a fight over whether the Trump administration has to comply with subpoenas in an impeachment inquiry, it would almost certainly be expedited. But that wouldn’t stop White House lawyers from trying to slow-walk the process and hope that it kills Democrats’ momentum. And even if the Supreme Court decided to swoop in and short-circuit the legal process, it’s hard to imagine how the justices could weigh in by the end of November, when some Democrats have said they want to have articles of impeachment written up.
Who’d have the edge in a legal fight — the president or Congress?
If comes down to a legal fight, the Supreme Court would probably end up making the final call. And it wouldn’t be a slam dunk for either side. Several legal experts told me that in a previous era, they’d expect the justices to lean toward Congress, since Trump’s use of executive privilege is so aggressive. But the high court has never weighed in on the scope of executive privilege in a congressional investigation, and the current conservative majority might be a friendlier audience for the president, given some of the justices’ views on executive power. For instance, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested at one point in his career that the case involving the Nixon tapes might have been wrongly decided.
What if Democrats don’t have time to take Trump to court?
Democrats’ best bet, if they don’t want to trigger a lengthy legal battle, may be to get members of the administration to defy orders and testify anyway. And that already seems to have happened in at least one case. Lawyers for the Trump administration warned Fiona Hill, a former Russia analyst for Trump, that information about “diplomatic communications” would be covered by executive privilege. But Hill’s lawyers pushed back, contending (among other things) that executive privilege doesn’t apply when there’s been government misconduct. Hill did reportedly testify about diplomatic communications (her testimony was given at a closed-door hearing, so we don’t have all the details), but she hasn’t faced any consequences yet, so that may embolden others.
There’s also reason to think that if Trump’s use of executive privilege was particularly egregious, it could be spun as an impeachable offense itself. It wouldn’t be the first time — in the impeachment proceedings against Clinton, the president’s use of executive privilege was called frivolous and corrupt by House Republicans. So if Democrats can’t get all of the information they want, they could at least use Trump’s refusal to provide it as more fodder for impeachment.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Assembly Bill 5
Freelance writers across California are concerned about the conditions of Assembly Bill 5, a new piece of legislation aimed at cracking down on gig-economy companies like Uber and Lyft. The law, which will go into effect on Jan. 1, will set an annual cap of 35 “submissions” that freelancers can contribute to each individual employer. Pay rates at some websites can run as low as $25 per article, so many writers are concerned that in order to cover the state’s high cost of living, they would hit the 35-submissions-a-year limit within a month.

10 years of blackouts
After as many as 800,000 California households went through an energy blackout this month, the CEO of Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. told regulators last week that the experience will likely be repeated annually for the next decade. On Friday, Bill Johnson said it could take 10 years before outages meant to reduce the threat of wildfires are “really ratcheted down significantly.” Johnson admitted that PG&E was unprepared for the number of customers contacting its call centers and inundating its website, which crashed.

$36 million
Angelina Jolie’s cheekbones as the winged character Maleficent are still impressively sharp, but the “Mistress of Evil” sequel to the 2014 hit movie made only $36 million this past weekend. While it was No. 1 at the box office and knocked “Joker” out of the top spot, that amount was much lower than expectations from analysts as well as Disney’s own predictions. The original film grossed $69.4 million during its opening weekend. [Bloomberg]

33,000 bottles recalled
Johnson & Johnson’s negative streak of news continues after the company announced on Friday that it was recalling 33,000 bottles of its namesake baby powder from lot number 22318RB. The move was in response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finding a small amount of asbestos in one bottle, and it follows tens of thousands of lawsuits related to the company’s talcum powder, opioid drugs and other products. The lawsuits related to baby powder and other J&J items containing talc claim that usage resulted in ovarian cancer and a rare type of cancer called mesothelioma. [The Wall Street Journal]
9 killed in Kashmir
Authorities from both India and Pakistan say that nine civilians and soldiers were killed on Saturday and Sunday after the two countries exchanged fire in the disputed region of Kashmir.

The Wall Street Journal reports that WeWork CEO Adam Neumann might receive up to an eye-watering $1.7 billion to give SoftBank his voting rights to the commercial real estate and co-working company. The deal from the Japanese firm includes up to $970 million for Neumann’s shares, a $185 million consulting fee, and $500 million in credit for loan repayment. The deal would also give SoftBank control of the company, and WeWork a valuation of approximately $8 billion, a fraction of its perceived value at the beginning of this year. [Wall Street Journal]
5 top starting pitchers
This year’s World Series matchup between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros is notable for a lot of reasons, including five starting pitchers with a historic amount of talent. Sportswriter Travis Sawchik writes that both teams feature at least two “starting pitchers who produced 5 or more wins above replacement for the Series opponents during the regular season.” The last time the World Series had two teams with pitching at this level of talent was in 2001, when Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling of the Arizona Diamondbacks faced off against Roger Clemens and Mike Mussina of the New York Yankees.

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): After the fourth Democratic debate in October, Pete Buttigieg hit 13 percent in a Suffolk/USA Today Iowa poll, coming in third, while Amy Klobuchar got her second qualifying poll for the November debate. And a FiveThirtyEight average of polls in Iowa since August actually showed Buttigieg had been overperforming there and in New Hampshire even before the fourth debate. So what do we make of this new post-debate narrative that maybe this isn’t just a two-candidate race, and there’s more potential for candidates like Buttigieg and Klobuchar to break out of the lower tiers of candidates. Do folks buy this? Are we headed for another Buttigieg surge?
natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): I think the narrative is mostly bullshit. Just want to get that on the record nice and early.
sarahf: 🔥
So why is it b.s.?
natesilver: Like, it’s possible he’ll surge, and I certainly think he had a good debate, and he’s probably gained a point or so, which isn’t nothing! But to say there’s been a big Buttigieg surge is so far from reality that, if you simply glance at a table of polls, it almost feels like gaslighting. He’s maybe gained a point or so in national polls.

geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, elections analyst): It’s definitely possible that the media wanted something new to talk about for the 2020 Democratic primary, and this gives them an opportunity to do that.
sarahf: But Nate, I don’t think anyone is going to argue that this is a big surge — or at least I’m not. But I do think his standing in Iowa or New Hampshire is much higher than what you would anticipate given where he is in the national polls.
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, I found that Buttigieg was polling at about 9 percent in Iowa before the September debate and then at 11 percent after that debate. There haven’t been enough polls to see whether he’s really crept up a little bit more after the October debate, but it’s definitely possible.

natesilver: But his 13 percent in that USA Today/Suffolk poll is actually very typical of how he’s already been polling in Iowa. He’s had a lot of polls, both now and during his previous peak in the late spring/early summer, where he polled above 15 percent, in fact.

sarahf: Right, but how should we interpret his higher standing in Iowa or New Hampshire?
Is that meaningful at this point?
natesilver: He’s a good candidate for those states because (1) They’re really white, and his supporters are really white; (2) He’s got enough money to build out a good ground game; (3) He’s got a regional advantage in Iowa by being one of the few Midwsterners in the race.
So I take his chances in Iowa pretty seriously! I just don’t think anything much has changed about them over the past week.
julia_azari (Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): I take Nate’s point about national polls, but an unexpected showing in Iowa seems like the kind of thing that could shape this race, especially if Joe Biden tanks and there’s an opportunity for someone else to wrestle the moderate mantle away.
natesilver: The scenarios where Iowa is like: 1) Buttigieg at 25 percent; 2) Elizabeth Warren at 23 percent; 3) Biden at 19 percent; 4) Bernie Sanders at 15 percent are pretty interesting for what happens next. (These scenarios are basically what you’d get if you take the current polling averages for each candidate, but Buttigieg gains another 10 percent.)
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, a Buttigieg first or even second-place finish would be a curveball, based on what we see right now.
natesilver: I don’t know, Geoff, that a second-place finish would matter all that much. He’s in it to win it, baby.
geoffrey.skelley: But if it were Warren-Buttigieg-Biden-Sanders or something, that could give him a shot at grabbing the moderate mantle.
And since the early states are so much about expectations: Are you meeting them? Exceeding them? Falling short? Buttigieg could use a strong result in Iowa to strengthen his long-term position in the race.
julia_azari: Yeah, if neither Warren nor Biden can really turn themselves into true consensus candidates, and Buttigieg emerges as an alternative, a second-place finish for him could be big.
But the order matters. If Biden finishes first and Warren third, I’m less convinced this is big for Buttigieg. Beating Biden is much more significant IMO.
But I may be overemphasizing lanes today. My mentality about this primary shifts regularly.
natesilver: Is it significant, though, if Buttigeig narrowly beats Biden in a state that basically only has white people, when Biden crushes him among nonwhite voters?
geoffrey.skelley: Biden’s problem, though, is that Iowa and New Hampshire vote first, and if he has a really poor showing there that could hurt his standing in a state like Nevada or South Carolina.
sarahf: That was my question, too, Nate. How much does it really matter for Buttigieg’s overall chances if he’s doing well in Iowa and New Hampshire, and not in, say, South Carolina? And suppose he can’t outright win Iowa or New Hampshire. Who might his performance hurt most if he continues to eat up a significant share of support? Warren? Biden?
natesilver: If Iowa is 1) Warren; 2) Buttigieg; 3) Biden, then… that’s mostly good news for Warren, right?
It’s very good news for Warren, in fact.
geoffrey.skelley: I would think so. In that scenario, Sanders is very damaged and Biden nearly as much. I don’t think Biden can finish below the top 2 in Iowa without losing a lot of credibility regarding his electability pitch.
natesilver: Yeah, it’s pretty much her perfect scenario. Because it does become debatable who’s ahead in the moderate “lane” (I KNOW THAT LANES ARE A COMPLICATED CONCEPT READERS!!!!!), whereas she clearly wins the liberal lane.
sarahf: But can Warren and Buttigieg both finish in the top 2 if they’re appealing to largely the same kinds of voters? Seems unlikely, no?
natesilver: Buttigieg is interesting in that he’s more or less explicitly running as a moderate (or at least he is now; whether he was before is a matter of some debate) but his constituency (i.e., college-educated white people) overlaps a LOT with Warren’s.
And Warren’s polls in Iowa haven’t been spectacular lately, and one reason for that almost HAS to be Buttigieg since you’d think it would be a good state for her.
geoffrey.skelley: So maybe this is all secretly good news for Biden!
natesilver: In Morning Consult’s polling, slightly more Buttigieg voters have Warren rather than Biden as their second choice, even though Biden is ahead of Warren in their overall polling.
So it could be good news for Biden, Geoff. At the very least, it’s ambiguous news if it complicates Warren’s path to winning Iowa.
p.s. I should probably point out, as I’m fond of doing, that the media takes a lot of things to be bad news for Biden, but he’s still in first place in national polls and his standing hasn’t really declined at all. His post-debate polls have been pretty decent, in fact.
julia_azari: One thing that’s hard to unpack here is that even though Buttigieg shares constituents with Warren that are similar demographically, he’s actually trying to ideologically position himself more as a competitor to Biden. His questions for Warren on health care during the October debate reflect this in particular, so I think it’s hard to know who Buttigieg will affect more — Biden or Warren? Is one possibility that it’s a wash, and maybe, at this stage, it affects other candidates more?
natesilver: I mean, there are quite a few other candidates that have an Iowa-focused strategy. Klobuchar for one.
And Harris is “moving to f***ing Iowa” or whatever, even though I’m not sure that’s a smart strategy for her campaign.
sarahf: But, surely, if we don’t buy the narrative that Buttigieg is experiencing a surge, we can’t possibly argue that Klobuchar is, right? I mean she did hit 3 percent in that Suffolk poll, which helps her get a qualifying poll under her belt for November.
But that’s not like… great news for her, right?
geoffrey.skelley: No. Three percent is nothing to write home about if a key part of your strategy is predicated on winning or being competitive in the state where you’re polling at 3 percent.
natesilver: I mean they’ve both maybe gained a point or two? Neither of them is really surging, I think is my point. He’s quite a bit more viable than she is, though, if he’s gone from 12 to 13 and she’s gone from 2 to 3.5 or whatever.
geoffrey.skelley: I guess it’s possible that more voters will tune into Klobuchar now. But I think it would take the oft-mentioned Biden collapse for her to get more traction, and even then, the other leading candidates might be able to fill that void and they already have a lot more resources.
natesilver: One thing that I think is pretty hard to tell is how much of the “other candidates are surging narrative!” is based on reporters being bored and just sort of inventing a narrative out of thin air — which can absolutely happen sometimes — versus reflecting dissatisfaction among certain Democratic activists or establishment types with the current front-runners.
This article, for instance, is very strange, since it talks to a bunch of people who apparently think Hillary Clinton or Mike Bloomberg of John Kerry should jump into the race, which is the sort of thing that only people living in a “Morning Joe” bubble could ever possibly think was a good idea.
(p.s. If you’re going to resurrect a past failed Democratic nominee, why not Al Gore?!?! He’s five years younger than Biden!)
julia_azari: I bet Michael Dukakis is flexible. He could get someone to cover his classes.
geoffrey.skelley: But there may be some actual concern among activist types. FiveThirtyEight contributors Seth Masket and Dave Peterson recently wrote on the site that a fair share of activists and voters were concerned about having Biden or Sanders as the potential nominee.
julia_azari: The other thing about Buttigieg, thinking about Nate’s point about polling and viability, is that I can see a factional strategy for him. Like, could Buttigieg build a 30 percent type coalition of reform-minded people who like how he talks about fixing institutions and being pragmatic, along with moderates who don’t warm to Klobuchar and prefer him to Biden in the end? Maybe.
There’s potential for Buttigieg to capitalize on people angry about “the system.”
natesilver: Yeah, and I suspect those positions are slightly more popular among actual voters than they are in The Discourse on Twitter and so on. Obama actually harnessed a lot of that “post-partisan” narrative to his advantage.
julia_azari: Yes, that’s a perfect example of the kind of appeal I’m talking about.
But it’s also possible that a substantial number of voters are over that — I just don’t know. But I am seeing evidence in research and surveys that people are suspicious of parties and party elites and party conflict.
Weirdly, though, no one has really adopted the anti-party stance in a full-throated way in this primary (other than someone like Andrew Yang, who is a whole other chat IMO).
sarahf: I’m less sure about Buttigieg’s appeal as a candidate who can take on “the system,” but repositioning himself as a moderate and pushing Warren on Medicare for All has been smart politics.
julia_azari: Yeah, and as I said earlier, Buttigieg’s fate may be more dependent on what happens to Biden than any thing he does.
Perhaps I am falling into the trap Nate describes as being a media person who discounts Biden; I just see him as a candidate with a lot of liabilities.
natesilver: I mean, nobody would say Biden is the world’s best candidate. But he’s been leading the polls for months! And some prediction markets still only give him a 20 percent chance to win!
Given that there’s a lot we don’t know about how the primaries work — that’s one lesson from 2016, in fact — I think you have to be a bit more deferential to what voters are saying.
Along with also considering other paradigms.
julia_azari: That’s fair. A lot of what went wrong with predicting the 2016 Republican race came down to discounting and ignoring some pretty obvious data for months on end.
(I was no less guilty of this than anyone else.)
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, Biden isn’t polling that differently from where he was in the first half of 2019, and he had roughly a 40 percent shot of winning the nomination back in July, based on historical polling.
Although this is probably a good time to note that the sample size of competitive presidential primaries is not that big! Or the sample size of presidential elections, period. So maybe Biden’s chances are better than 40 percent; maybe worse. Still, he’s almost certainly being underestimated.
sarahf: Sure, but in that same piece, Geoff, you highlighted the fact that given Buttigieg’s lower name recognition, we shouldn’t entirely write him off either. So I’d say while the media might be underselling Biden’s chances, it’s possible they haven’t been paying too much attention to Buttigieg’s performance in Iowa and New Hampshire and how that could change the race if he continues to perform well there.
geoffrey.skelley: Oh definitely. That analysis looked at national polling, so yeah, a strong start in Iowa and New Hampshire could move the needle for Buttigieg, maybe weaken Biden (or someone else) and shake up the race. After all, Buttigieg still isn’t as well-known as the other leading candidates — Morning Consult’s latest polling found 62 percent of primary voters had a favorable or unfavorable view of him, versus over 90 percent for Biden and Sanders and 82 percent for Warren. So that suggests he has potential for further growth among those who still aren’t that familiar with him.
natesilver: Yeah, none of this is to suggest that Buttigieg doesn’t have a path.
He has one of the clearer paths, after Warren, Biden and probably Sanders.
We should probably talk about a couple of concerns, though: 1) How plausible is it that he can expand his support among nonwhite voters? 2) How big of a concern are his lack of traditional credentials? 3) Are Democrats ready to nominate a gay candidate?
julia_azari: On question 1, I’m not seeing much evidence that he can, at least with black voters. But one other question for me, Nate, is whether it makes sense to think of Buttigieg as the fourth-place contender when Harris and he aren’t that far apart in the national polls?
natesilver: It’s a good question. I guess the answer is that 1) Harris doesn’t have a strong toehold in any of the early states; 2) She’s been losing ground in the polls and making a lot of questionable strategic decisions for months now.
But if there are party elites who are dissatisfied with both Warren and Biden, it’s surprising that Harris isn’t getting a longer look.
sarahf: Do you think they’ll look at Buttigieg, instead? Seems unlikely, given his lack of traditional credentials, as you mentioned.
geoffrey.skelley: Democrats have traditionally cared more about experience than Republicans do when it comes to their candidates, so that might be a problem for point No. 2. A Morning Consult poll from March found, for instance, that 66 percent of Democrats said that having “decades of political experience” was very important or somewhat important, while just 27 percent said it wasn’t that important.
julia_azari: That’s another interesting question. He still lacks real traction in the endorsement primary, to the extent anyone is invested in that anymore.
sarahf: On the subject of voting for an openly gay candidate, though — nearly 20 percent of Democrats still aren’t on board with the idea, which is honestly a lot higher than I would have thought.

natesilver: On the other hand, being the gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana gives Buttigieg sort of an underdog quality that’s important to his appeal.
Like, if he was the straight mayor of Indianapolis, would anyone be talking about him?
julia_azari: That’s a good point. It is the underdog quality. I also think that publicly demonstrating their tolerance toward diversity is an important part of some Democrats’ identities, and having a gay candidate helps affirm that. So it might help him with some voters in the party even as it hurts with others.
natesilver: I do wonder with Buttigieg if there’s sort of an almost fairy-tale notion to what his candidacy represents that could help him win Iowa, but then not hold up to scrutiny particularly well, once voters gave him a longer look. No offense to South Bend, which is an awful lot like the town where I grew up (East Lansing, Michigan). But if the mayor of East Lansing was suddenly a major presidential contender, I’d find that pretty surprising!
julia_azari:  Yeah. There are a lot of questions about how much voters can and should care about experience. But I can imagine a scenario in which Democrats are becoming more invested in symbolism — like underdog politics — and less in governance. I also think, well, if Trump is president, are we really going to be overly invested in experience? And I’m not sure I find this compelling, but Buttigieg, along with 50 mayors who endorsed him, makes the case that that kind of executive experience is better preparation than being a backbench legislator.
natesilver: I’m not sure I find it compelling, either, but it’s perhaps slightly more compelling in a primary where there are a conspicuous lack of governors.
geoffrey.skelley: To sort of sum up, I think Buttigieg still has a shot at winning the nomination. Not a big chance, but far more than I would’ve anticipated given his profile as a candidate. He’s polling well in Iowa and New Hampshire, and if he gets good results in them, he might find himself among the last group of competitive candidates for the nomination. So I’d say he’s about as well-positioned as he could be, given everything else.
natesilver:  Yeah, Geoff: It can both be true that Buttigieg has a real shot and that the recent media narrative about his surging is mostly bullshit! Those aren’t mutually exclusive at all! It’s a long primary, and the media sometimes gets bored and starts reporting out stories that have been there all along, but which got ignored earlier for whatever reason.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-the-bears-look-for-a-new-quarterback/,2019-10-23,,,features,"Oct. 23, 2019",Should The Bears Look For A New Quarterback?,Michael Salfino,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"The only thing worse in the NFL than being sure that you don’t have a franchise quarterback is being in the purgatory of not being sure that your quarterback is actually “the dude.”
That the Bears are facing this question in year No. 3 of Mitchell Trubisky’s career is perhaps an answer in itself. In other words, if you don’t know 31 games into a career whether your signal-caller is that coveted difference-maker who is worthy of being paid like one, he probably isn’t.
It’s not as if the Bears have much longer to decide whether to fully commit to Trubisky and offer him a lucrative second contract. After all, this summer, the Eagles and Rams each signed their 2016 top picks — Carson Wentz (second overall) and Jared Goff (first overall) — to nine-figure deals. If that’s the new standard, the Bears would have to make the call on their second-overall 2017 draft pick after this season.
Trubisky has started five games for the Bears this season, including one he left early with an injury, and the team failed to generate 300 yards of total offense in any of them. The Bears also failed to reach that relatively modest yardage mark (teams are averaging 351.2 yards this year) in the game started by Trubisky’s backup, Chase Daniel. Only one other Bears team since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, the 1975 squad, had this long a streak of offensive ineptitude to start the season.
Trubisky is missing open throws. His downfield passing has declined appreciably from last year, measured by average depth of target (6.7 yards from scrimmage compared with 8.8 in 2018) and air yards per completion (4.0 versus 6.3). He’s no longer presenting a viable running threat (just 21 yards all season, down from more than 400 in 2018).1
The Bears passed on both 2018 MVP Patrick Mahomes and 2019 MVP candidate Deshaun Watson to select Trubisky in the 2017 draft. So it’s not surprising that fans are frustrated by his lack of progress, especially after his performance in Sunday’s 36-25 loss to the Saints, when his stats were boosted by two meaningless scoring drives long after the game was decided. Head coach Matt Nagy said he understands that there are no more excuses for either him or his quarterback nearly a season and a half into their tenure together.
But Trubisky’s performance was one game against one of the league’s leading defenses. To more fairly assess Trubisky, let’s look at the other first-round quarterbacks selected this century and see where they were in cumulative passer rating through their 31st game. We also note the NFL-wide passer rating in the season in which these QBs played their 31st game.

By this measure, Trubisky ranks 10th among the 48 first-round quarterbacks. Those he has so far exceeded in passer rating through the same career point include Cam Newton, Joe Flacco, Philip Rivers, Matthew Stafford, Matt Ryan, Andrew Luck and Eli Manning.
But passer rating has risen steadily this century. When you compare each passer to the benchmark of the league average rating in the season in which they played their 31st game, Trubisky drops to 19th — and is then ahead of only Luck and Manning from that list.
By yards per attempt, Trubisky’s 6.8 career mark would rank 20th, leaving him ahead of only Manning in that group. But if Manning was viewed as a franchise quarterback — and, of course, he did win two Super Bowl MVPs after his 31st career game — it’s hard to say that Trubisky definitely will not be one.
But it’s clearly not out of bounds for Bears fans to question Trubisky’s long-term viability. He does rank behind a number of first-round busts who never saw a sixth season with the clubs that drafted them in the first round, including Jason Campbell, Byron Leftwich and Josh Freeman.
Trubisky’s passer rating, as indicated by his garbage-time-inflated number of 86.3 on Sunday, may not be the best measure of his quality of play. ESPN’s Total QBR looks at the success or failure of every play and the points that play is expected to generate. Measured this way, Trubisky ranks 30th on the season at just 34.2 (100 is the highest possible number), quite a distance from the QBR average of 54.2. Trubisky’s QBR is suffering this year partly because of his lack of running. Last year, Trubisky raced for 29 first downs, second on the team. This year, he’s gained just one.
So instead of contending for a Super Bowl after last year’s 12-4 season, Chicago is mired at 3-3 and in third place in the NFC North heading into a Week 8 home matchup with the 2-5 Chargers.
Trubisky will try to find some way to spark the offense. But right now, he seems lost. “I mean, right now we have no identity,” Trubisky said after the Saints game. “We’re just searching.”
If his team keeps searching like this, it might be searching next for a new quarterback.
Looking Ahead: Week 8
Best matchup:2 No. 14 Philadelphia at No. 13 Buffalo (-2.5), 1 p.m. ET Sunday
Packers-Chiefs — a rematch of Super Bowl I — was looking like the week’s marquee matchup, but Patrick Mahomes’s injury spoiled those plans. Instead, the top game of Week 8 features the Bills and Eagles, two teams that are right next to each other in our Elo power rankings despite having wildly different records. Buffalo has tallied a 5-1 mark so far, making it one of only five teams with one loss or fewer this season, but the Bills have done it against a ridiculously weak schedule. Their opposing slate rates as the NFL’s second-easiest in Football Outsiders’ rankings and third-easiest according to Pro-Football-Reference.com’s Simple Rating System. So Philly is actually much tougher than the Bills’ typical opponent, even though its Elo rating is barely better than average. And from the Eagles’ perspective, that’s a pretty disappointing status. They went into the season with Super Bowl aspirations but have gone 3-4 thus far, as QB Carson Wentz has been up and down and the team’s defense has not impressed. After a humiliating loss to Dallas on Sunday Night Football, Philadelphia needs a strong showing on the road in Orchard Park just to stabilize its flagging playoff odds. But there is good news: That’s hardly an impossible task, even after such a mediocre start to the season. We give the Eagles a 42 percent shot at the upset, which is the highest of any underdog this week.

Game Quality is based on the Elo Ratings of both teams. Evenness is based on how close the game is to 50-50 pregame odds. A game’s importance is based on how much it swings the playoff odds of the teams involved. A game’s Quarterbacks are judged on the QB Elo ratings of the two starters.
Biggest playoff implications: No. 22 Oakland at No. 9 Houston (-7), 4:25 p.m. ET Sunday
Potential shift in playoff odds: 23.9 total percentage points
Last week, we wrote that Houston had the chance to really solidify its status as AFC South front-runners with a win at Indianapolis. That didn’t happen, though. Now, Deshaun Watson and the Texans find themselves in the most crucial game of Week 8, against a Raiders team with a surprising .500 record and a lot to gain from an upset here. Our model thinks Oakland’s postseason chances would go up from 27 percent to 48 percent if Derek Carr and Co. can engineer the win — something we say has a respectable 26 percent chance of happening. (With Mahomes out and K.C. only a game and a half up on the Raiders in the AFC West, Oakland fans at least have something to dream about, right?) At the same time, the pressure is on the Texans to avoid any further slippage in their playoff odds. We give them a solid 64 percent chance right now — sixth-highest in the AFC — but that number would fall to 40 percent with a loss to Oakland, and their division odds would drop to just 23 percent. Watson is the better QB, and Houston is the better team, so they should hold serve at home. But if not, this matchup has the potential to shake up the AFC playoff picture.
Best QB duels: No. 2 Matt Ryan* (ATL) vs. No. 5 Russell Wilson (SEA); No. 4 Deshaun Watson (HOU) vs. No. 13 Derek Carr (OAK); No. 10 Philip Rivers (LAC) vs. No. 17 Mitchell Trubisky (CHI)
* Ryan may not play because of injury.

Home teams are in bold.
The scoring system is nonlinear, so readers’ average points don’t necessarily match the number of points that would be given to the average reader prediction.
After a batch of picks undone by one disastrous outcome in Week 6, FiveThirtyEight readers did better in Week 7 — though they still lost to Elo overall. They were more bullish on the Rams and Jaguars than the algorithm and were rewarded for it, and they rightly picked New Orleans to beat the Bears at Soldier Field. But the readers also bet on the Chargers and lost, lacked faith in the Vikings and perhaps overcorrected after the Cowboys’ loss to the Jets, undervaluing Dallas against Philadelphia. Adding it up, the average reader lost to Elo by a margin of 8.1 points in Week 7 — a third straight loss (and fifth of the season) for the field after picking up back-to-back wins in Weeks 3 and 4.
Even so, congratulations are in order for Carl Kuhl, who led all readers in Week 7 with 219.3 points, and for John Ahlfield, who pulled into the full-season contest lead with 527.6 points. Thanks to everyone who played — and if you haven’t, be sure to get in on the action! You can make picks now and try your luck against Elo, even if you missed Week 7.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-disapproved-of-clintons-behavior-but-not-enough-to-impeach-him/,2019-10-22,,,features,"Oct. 22, 2019",Why Trump’s Impeachment Might Be Different Than Clinton’s,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,FiveThirtyEight,Impeachment,"In the fall of 1998, it seemed like President Clinton was in trouble. An investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr had uncovered an affair between the president and White House intern Monica Lewinsky. And after months of denials, Clinton finally admitted to having had “an inappropriate relationship” with Lewinsky, which was then recounted in graphic detail in the report Starr sent to Congress. The affair and the president’s attempts to hide it were quickly denounced by Republicans and Democrats alike. In a speech on the Senate floor, then-Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman said Clinton’s conduct was “disgraceful” and “immoral.” Just a few weeks later, the House voted to open an impeachment inquiry, with the support of 31 Democrats.
Months later, though, Clinton hadn’t just survived the impeachment process — he had managed to weather it with high approval ratings and the backing of his party. Despite bipartisan rumblings of displeasure with the president as the inquiry took off, public support never really coalesced behind impeachment, and the effort was ultimately perceived by many as a partisan attack by House Republicans bent on taking down a political opponent.
So as the Democrats plunge forward with their impeachment inquiry, Clinton’s failed impeachment looms as a cautionary tale. After all, no Republicans at this point have come out in support of an impeachment inquiry, which means Democrats will arguably have even more work to do to convince the public that the allegations against President Trump aren’t merely political. And although support for impeachment is on the upswing, it’s hard to predict if that will last — or if public opinion will just ossify along familiar partisan lines, as it did during Clinton’s impeachment.
It’s tempting to think of Trump’s impeachment as a sequel of sorts, but there are already signs that what’s happening today could unfold quite differently. For one thing, the case against Clinton hinged on the findings in Starr’s report. By contrast, today’s Democrats didn’t choose to orient their inquiry around findings in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that examined misconduct by Trump: They are instead building a case against the president in real time, which makes it harder to predict where the public will ultimately land.
And although there’s still a significant risk that the investigation will be perceived as partisan, the nature of the allegations against Trump are quite different. Many Americans saw Clinton’s affair with Lewinsky as a “private matter,” but Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is much more clearly tied to his role as commander-in-chief. So it’s entirely possible that the public will be less forgiving this time.
Clinton was popular. Impeachment wasn’t.
By the time the House of Representatives voted to open an impeachment inquiry against Clinton in October 1998, the allegations against the president had been in the news for months. Clinton had publicly confessed to the affair in August, and in mid-September, Starr delivered his lengthy and salacious report — which included a case for impeaching Clinton — to Congress.
At that moment, support for impeachment seemed like it might be on the upswing. A Gallup poll conducted in mid-October, just after the House voted to formally open an impeachment inquiry, found that 48 percent of the public supported the decision to hold hearings. But as the chart below shows, support for impeachment didn’t continue to tick upward. In mid-December, when the House voted to impeach Clinton on two counts of perjury and obstruction of justice, just about 40 percent of the public continued to think he should be impeached — and the same was true in February, when the Senate voted to acquit him.
This didn’t stop Republicans from raking Clinton over the coals in the lead-up to the 1998 midterm elections, though. That’s perhaps because there was one segment of the public that did see an uptick in support for impeachment — Republican voters. In mid-August 1998, an ABC News poll found that only 38 percent of Republicans thought Clinton should be impeached and removed from office. But by the time the House had voted to impeach him, about two-thirds of Republicans were on board. The GOP’s attacks, though, didn’t seem to have the effect of boosting overall support for impeachment; if anything, it just resulted in a widening partisan divide.
Clinton’s presidential approval ratings were also high when the scandal started to unravel, and they remained remarkably undented throughout the impeachment process. Approval of his job performance had been hovering between 60 and 70 percent through most of 1998, and with the exception of a small dip around the time the Starr report was released in September, they stayed above 60 percent. In fact, according to FiveThirtyEight’s tracker of presidential approval, Clinton’s approval ratings hit 67 percent at the end of December 1998, just after he was impeached by the House. It was among the highest job approval ratings he received at any point in his administration.
There were other signs, too, that the public didn’t think Clinton should be removed from office. Republicans’ efforts to impeach Clinton appeared to be dramatically backfiring in real time — after running a slew of ads attacking Clinton in the lead-up to the midterms, they lost seats and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had been one of Clinton’s loudest critics, resigned the speakership.
That electoral loss has been woven, over the years, into a cautionary fable about the costs of impeachment without broad public support. But, of course, Clinton himself didn’t emerge unscathed — Americans generally disapproved of his handling of the scandal and questioned his integrity, and those sentiments may have hurt Democrats in the 2000 election. So while it’s difficult to evaluate whether the Republicans or the Democrats paid more of a price in the long term, the impeachment process clearly left a mark on both.
Some Democrats were unhappy with Clinton, but not enough to support impeachment
It wasn’t always clear that Democrats would stand by Clinton. Some distanced themselves from the president in the lead-up to the midterm elections; others even questioned whether he should resign. The initial vote to refer Starr’s report to the House Judiciary Committee for further investigation passed by an overwhelming margin. And when the House voted a few weeks later to open a formal impeachment inquiry, 31 moderate Democrats were in support. “Many Democrats were angry and frustrated that their leader had lied to them,” said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. “That softened them to the idea of at least having an investigation.”
But after a fairly brief period, the House was divided once again into familiar partisan camps. By the time the House voted on the articles of impeachment against Clinton just five Democrats voted to impeach the president. And when it was the Senate’s turn to decide whether Clinton should remain in office, only Republicans crossed the aisle, with 10 GOP senators voting to acquit Clinton on at least one of the charges.
Why did Democrats fall in line behind Clinton? The Republicans’ aggressive pursuit of impeachment — even in the absence of a clear public consensus — may have pushed Democrats to close ranks. “A significant number of Democrats thought there should be some consequence for Clinton’s behavior, like a formal censure vote,” said Philip Bobbitt, a professor of law at Columbia University and the coauthor of “Impeachment: A Handbook.” “But when it became clear that the Republicans were just going for impeachment, they became much more defensive.”
Clinton also did damage control of his own. After first trying to quickly move past the scandal, he delivered an extravagant apology for his conduct on the day Starr’s report was released, saying he had “sinned” and “repented.” That apparent contrition may have helped some Democrats rally around him, although others remained angry with him throughout the process. As late as February, Sen. Dianne Feinstein — who months earlier had said her confidence in Clinton’s credibility was “shattered” by the revelation of the affair — pushed for a bipartisan vote in the Senate to censure Clinton. But as upset as Democrats might have been with Clinton for having the affair, or for trying to conceal it, they continued to support the president, bolstered by the fact that public opinion was largely on their side.
“By the end, very few Democrats, even if they disliked Clinton, were willing to say his behavior was worthy of impeachment,” Zelizer said. “And many Republicans in the Senate had the same misgivings.”
It’s dangerous to draw too many parallels between what happened then and what’s occurring in Congress now. For one thing, the Democrats are still in the early stages of their inquiry. But experts told me that there are some lessons for today’s Democrats in the story of Clinton’s impeachment.
First, there is the risk that, like the Republicans in Clinton’s impeachment, the Democrats’ investigation into Trump could be seen primarily as an attack on a political adversary. Starr’s investigation was seen as politically motivated, and the Republicans relied almost entirely on his findings, without trying to marshal evidence of their own. “This was a process that was perceived as partisan and rushed, with very few hearings and no revelation more shocking than the fact that the president had lied,” Zelizer said. And when House Republicans pressed ahead — even after it was clear from public opinion polls and the results of the 1998 midterms that much of the public just wasn’t convinced by their arguments — it only reinforced the perception that their true motivation was to hurt Clinton.
Some of these risks are obviously present for Democrats today. With no committed Republican support so far, it’s very difficult to argue that there aren’t partisan elements to the investigation. And as with the Clinton impeachment, Republicans and Democrats are deeply divided about the president’s conduct, which could make it difficult to build a true consensus around impeachment.
The Democrats’ inquiry is different, though, in that they don’t have a completed investigation like Starr’s. Democrats had an opportunity to frame an impeachment inquiry around a completed special counsel investigation after the exhaustive findings in Mueller’s report became public, but only moved forward with impeachment after the Ukraine allegations presented a new scandal and an evolving set of facts to pursue. As a result, they may be able to avoid (or at least mitigate) the perception that they were just looking for an excuse to impeach Trump, especially as new evidence continues to emerge.
And while the allegations against Clinton were personal and moral, the conduct at issue in Trump’s case is much more closely linked to his power as president, which could mean the public will be less inclined to dismiss it as human error. “With Clinton I think a lot of people looked at themselves in a mirror and said, ‘You know, I’d lie about my affair too,’” said Jeffrey Engel, a presidential historian at Southern Methodist University. “Pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political adversary is a lot less relatable.”
It’s too early to say whether any of these parallels will hold true. But while the risks are certainly there, the Democrats are still building their case. And they also have this history as a guide — which means they may be able to avoid some of their predecessors’ mistakes, rather than repeating them.

Which got us thinking, how many respondents were only considering one candidate?
FiveThirtyEight partnered with Ipsos to conduct a poll, using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, that asked respondents who they were thinking about voting for and allowed them to pick multiple candidates (or “someone else,” or no one). And while most respondents in the post-debate round of polling were considering more than one candidate (66 percent of respondents), 33 percent only picked one candidate.1
And as you can see in the table below, about a fifth of former Vice President Joe Biden’s supporters weren’t considering supporting anyone else, a higher share of exclusive supporters than any other candidate. Likewise, 14.6 percent of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s potential supporters weren’t looking anywhere else.

*Only considering one candidate
From a survey of 1,761 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed from Oct. 15 to Oct. 16.
So what do we make of the fact that such a high share of Biden’s and Sanders’s potential supporters were only considering them? It’s definitely a good sign for their campaigns, as it might be harder for other candidates to win these voters over. But it’s also not the only way to understand the strength of someone’s campaign, especially at this early stage in the primary. If you’re a candidate, getting a lot of voters to at least consider supporting you is important, too, as it means you’re still in the hunt for their vote, and the other candidates on a voter’s list tells you something about what parts of the party your message is appealing to.
Overall, more respondents were considering Biden than Sen. Elizabeth Warren (56.5 to 52.1 percent), but Warren actually shares a lot of potential supporters with the other candidates. Take the rest of the top five candidates — Biden, Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The lion’s share of voters who were considering each of those four were also considering Warren — even though Biden had more total potential supporters. Sanders was also being considered, but the percentage of respondents who also chose him wasn’t as large.
And it isn’t just among the top five candidates whose potential supporters were also thinking about Warren. For all but three candidates — Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and billionaire Tom Steyer — the person they were most likely to share potential supporters with was Warren. (Gabbard shares the most potential supporters with Sanders and businessman Andrew Yang, while Klobuchar and Steyer share the most with Biden.)
It’s clear Warren appeals to a wide range of Democratic voters, which puts her in a good position to gain supporters if another candidate drops out of the race. But she’s not alone in that position — just as many potential supporters of other candidates are considering Warren, many of Warren’s potential supporters are considering other candidates. So if Warren’s campaign were to run into trouble, candidates like Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg and Harris could stand to benefit.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-of-the-nfls-top-teams-are-for-real/,2019-10-22,,,features,"Oct. 21, 2019",Which Of The NFL’s Top Teams Are For Real?,A FiveThirtyEight Chat,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"sara.ziegler (Sara Ziegler, sports editor): Week 7 of the NFL season is just about wrapped up, and we’re starting to see some teams separate themselves from the rest of the league. So this week, I want to talk about the current crop of top squads.
We currently have nine teams with at least five wins: New England, Buffalo, Baltimore and Kansas City in the AFC, Green Bay, Minnesota, New Orleans, San Francisco and Seattle in the NFC. The Patriots and Niners are undefeated, with the Pats yet to play this week at the moment. Are those two the best of the best right now?
joshua.hermsmeyer (Josh Hermsmeyer, NFL analyst): Not if you believe, as I do, that the best way to forecast a team’s future performance is its early-down offense. The only problem is that the No. 1 team by that measure — the Chiefs — just lost their MVP quarterback.
neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): We still list the Pats as our top Super Bowl contender — what else is new? — at 26 percent to win it all. Our model has been a little slower to accept San Francisco (8 percent) as a true top contender. Maybe it’s because the 49ers have still really only played one opponent considered to be a top team — the Rams.
The rest of the Niners’ victims are pretty unimpressive: Tampa Bay, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Washington.
Salfino (Michael Salfino, FiveThirtyEight contributor): For sure, the Patriots and Niners are the likely No. 1 seeds. Both are firmly in control of their divisions. If I were to pick two other teams that are good bets to win the Super Bowl, or are at least in the conversation, it would be two NFC teams, though — Minnesota and New Orleans. Whichever gets the first-round bye is going to have a big edge. This assumes a healthy Drew Brees, of course, because let’s face it: Teddy Bridgewater just happens to be winning these games.
sara.ziegler: The Saints have to be thrilled with how well they’ve played without Brees, though — and last week without Alvin Kamara.
neil: Yes, I believe we (and everyone else) said that if Bridgewater could just keep them from sinking too far, or just keep them around .500, they could survive. Instead, they’ve been undefeated with him at starter.
Salfino: The Saints are like those old Patriots Super Bowl winners, pre-2007: just solid in every area. The only question is whether Brees can play near-peak form if needed in the postseason. Maybe the time off helps him maintain his play through the finish line.
Kamara is a generational talent, Josh.
joshua.hermsmeyer: * Chase Edmonds
sara.ziegler: * Latavius Murray
Salfino: We have to get Sara to talk about the Vikings, who are, I swear, legit Super Bowl contenders.
sara.ziegler: Mike.
No.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Agreed!
neil: Every week we do this.
sara.ziegler: They’re not.
neil: Cousins was great for a third straight week.
sara.ziegler: You guys.
Salfino: Captain Kirk is the first QB ever with three straight 300-yard passing games with a completion percentage of 75 and a passer rating over 130.


Kirk Cousins over his past three games: 68-of-90 (75.6%), 976 yards, 10 TD, 1 INT. 
He’s the only QB in NFL history with three straight games of at least 300 passing yards and a QB rating of 130.0 or better.
— Field Yates (@FieldYates) October 21, 2019

joshua.hermsmeyer: The Vikings are No. 3 in early-down offensive expected points added per play among teams with at least five wins, and they’re extremely well-balanced overall. I think they’re legit. Kirk can win them games.
They have to hope Thielen is OK, though.
sara.ziegler: Sigh.
Salfino: Cousins has made Mike Zimmer believe again in the forward pass, so, progress.
sara.ziegler: I think it was opposing defenses that did that.
Salfino: I worry, though, that Thielen will be out a month with his hamstring injury.
neil: Yeah, that’s a problem.
sara.ziegler: Though Bisi Johnson came out of nowhere to be a decent No. 2 wide receiver, behind Stefon Diggs.
Salfino: What a soft sell on Cousins by Sara. We’re all going to chip in and buy you the Cousins jersey.
sara.ziegler: I will not wear that.
LOL
Salfino: Revenge game on Thursday for Case Keenum.
sara.ziegler: What about the actual leader in the NFC North, Green Bay?
neil: Aaron Rodgers is ELITE again!
(We actually do rank him third among current starters in QB Elo.)
joshua.hermsmeyer: A-aron will win the MVP on the strength of one game — you know this is true.
neil: I was surprised that he had the first perfect passer rating game in Packers history, given the QBs they’ve had over the years. (Now the Jaguars and Panthers are the only teams who have never had one.)
joshua.hermsmeyer: I will stan for Rodgers — you put up those performances against Oakland if you are elite. Also, the running game is third-worst in yards per rush on early downs among teams with five wins. (Patriots and Chiefs are lower.)
sara.ziegler: I’m a little confused about why our model rates the Vikings higher than the Packers.
Salfino: The Vikings are much better at winning the passing game.
neil: Part of it might be that the Packers were coming off such a down season last year, too. Easy to forget we’re not even halfway into the 2019 season yet, so there’s still some amount of 2018 baked into the ratings right now.
sara.ziegler: (The Vikings weren’t much better. 😞)
joshua.hermsmeyer: The Ravens look pretty amazing, and Lamar Jackson needs to be in the MVP conversation, I think.
sara.ziegler: I was super surprised by the second half of the Ravens-Seahawks game. Baltimore just ran away with it.
neil: Such an impressive win for Baltimore. Going into Seattle, slowing down Russell Wilson — who is having an MVP-type season himself.
Salfino: Lamar is definitely in the MVP conversation. His approach is not a sustainable model with all that running, but it’s working now. His passing since Week 1 — measured in pretty much every way — has been “meh.” But who cares when you’re rushing for close to 100 yards a game. It seems like we — meaning football Twitter — all hate the run game but LOVE when the QB runs.
neil: We all grew up playing Madden 2004 with Mike Vick.

Salfino: Pete Carroll hasn’t been able to stop a running QB since Vince Young in the National Championship Game.

joshua.hermsmeyer: The Seahawks deserved to lose a game that was close for long stretches just based on their decision-making. Carroll likes to talk about keeping games close, as if it builds character or calluses, but it’s more a function of their lack of aggression on fourth down and an inability to maximize win probability.
neil: The 2019 Seahawks are kind of the same story as it’s been the past few years: Wilson is amazing, but the supporting cast — including, against brand, the defense — is questionable.
Salfino: Nothing came easy for Wilson and the offense. That’s the way things used to be with him and Seattle, but this year, that seemed to have changed. They were getting easy plays in structure without Wilson having to play like his hair was on fire. I think Wilson has aged out of being able to succeed when playing in a generally chaotic state. He should only be sprinkling it in now.
sara.ziegler: The Ravens have had kind of a weird season — losing to the Browns and barely beating the Steelers and Bengals.
neil: That win over Arizona in Week 2 is looking better and better, though. 😉
sara.ziegler: Haha — true.
Salfino: I was shocked by how well Baltimore’s defense played. I thought they were just a name brand and had lost too many people. But Wink Martindale has coached this unit up and then some. They looked dominant on Sunday. I think that was the biggest story out of that game, not Lamar. They need to add an edge rusher at the trading deadline, though.
joshua.hermsmeyer: There are football narratives I don’t really buy, but having a QB who can punish a defense with deep passes really does open up an offense. When Lamar has his deep ball working, I think the Ravens are tough to beat. All that said, there were two fluky defensive scores Sunday, so we need to temper our expectations a bit for the Ravens’ offense.
neil: Marcus Peters wasn’t enough of an addition for you, Mike?
Salfino: That was good, but it’s not pass-rush. They seem to really struggle there. As for Lamar, what’s interesting to me is that the Chargers solved him in the playoffs by playing seven defensive backs on nearly all downs when they were forced to because of injuries, just a couple of weeks after getting gashed by the Ravens in the running game. I guess this is not repeatable for teams because they are not going to construct a roster with all those DBs just to beat the Ravens.
joshua.hermsmeyer: That same defense was exposed the very next week, though.
Salfino: It wasn’t exposed by the Ravens, though.
sara.ziegler: Wow, remember when the Chargers weren’t terrible?
neil: OMG the CHARGERS
How many ways can a team find to lose games?
joshua.hermsmeyer: It’s sad! The Chargers seem like they should be good, kind of like a slightly better version of the Falcons, and yet.
neil: The Chargers have been doing less with more for a long time, but my goodness that game Sunday.
Salfino: Bigger football crime: Chargers moving from San Diego or not using the Human Cheat Code Austin Ekeler on more snaps? Ekeler had 118 receiving yards on eight targets. At RB.
sara.ziegler: Back to teams that are not awful, the other five-win team in the AFC is Buffalo. What do you make of the Bills?
joshua.hermsmeyer: A fermenting dumpster waiting for a match. Of the teams with five wins, they’re the only one with negative offensive EPA per play. I’m absolutely convinced their success is a mirage.
neil: Their defense remains legit on the season (fifth in EPA), but it’s never great to give up 21 points — and a pretty good QB game — to Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Phins.
Salfino: Fitz gave that game away with a pick after a first and goal inside the 5-yard line. A touchdown there would have made it 21-9 and “Murder She Wrote” for the Bills. But then, Josh Allen took them 98 yards for the 14-point swing.
neil: Yeah, that was a huge drive for Allen.
Salfino: Remember, the Jets would have beaten the Bills in Week 1 if Sam Darnold hadn’t been half-dead.
sara.ziegler: Yeah, that’s the only reason the Jets didn’t beat the Bills.
Salfino: “Spleen Talk,” Episode Six.
sara.ziegler: Hahahaha
neil: Can’t we talk about other organs for a change???
joshua.hermsmeyer: 🤐
neil: I will say this, Tre’Davious White is amazing. He made one of the INTs of the year.

joshua.hermsmeyer: Mike, I saw you tweet something about Jimmy Garoppolo not being able to hold onto the ball in the rain. I haven’t watched the full game yet — what was going on?
Salfino: He simply could not throw a spiral. It was bizarre.
The thing is, January is the rainy season in San Francisco. At least, it used to be.
sara.ziegler: When the field looks like this, you’ll take anything you can get, right?

joshua.hermsmeyer: Was Keenum any better? My prior right now is that Jimmy G is average at best.
Salfino: I was only paying attention to that screen when the Niners had the ball.
neil: I’ll give Jimmy G a pass for the conditions yesterday. But I keep waiting for one of two things to happen:
Niners stop winning
Jimmy G puts up a great stat game
Neither has happened!
joshua.hermsmeyer: LOL
Salfino: Jimmy G is like Teddy B.
neil: In our Elo QB ratings, Garoppolo has had a below-average start (adjusted for opposing defense) five times in six games this year.
The only good one was against Cincy.
Salfino: The Niners and Garoppolo seriously also remind me of those early 2000s Patriots teams. They also spread the ball around, lack fantasy significance, are very well-coached and crush the opposing passing games. And they have a QB who is not lighting up the stat sheet but manages the game (pre-2007 Brady).
joshua.hermsmeyer: Interesting comp. Is 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan up to the Bill Belichick comparison though?
neil: I look forward to Jimmy G’s stats finally taking off when they trade a fourth-round pick for Randy Moss Jr.
Salfino: How about A.J. Green?
neil: Haha. Green certainly deserves better than the Bengals.
Lowkey, they — and NOT the Dolphins — are last in our Elo rankings!
sara.ziegler: Ooof, Neil.
neil: Reminds me of how we all assumed that the Orioles would be the worst team in baseball, and the Tigers were like, hold my beer.
sara.ziegler: So, you guys bring up an interesting point: Which players out there would make these top-tier teams better?
Salfino: Teams that should go all in are the ones we started with, IMO.
The NFC is so strong that one trade can tip the balance between the 49ers, Saints and Vikings. (Notice I did not say the Rams, who already made their trade.)
joshua.hermsmeyer: The Niners should trade for Broncos fullback Andy Janovich to save their season.
Salfino: In the AFC, the team that’s screaming out for a trade is the Ravens. I would add Vic Beasley from the Falcons. A pure edge rusher.
neil: Seems like there are a ton of WRs potentially on the trade block.
sara.ziegler: NOT DIGGS, THO
neil: Well, beyond just Green, also Emmanuel Sanders, Mohamed Sanu, etc.
Maybe even Robby Anderson?!
Salfino: Julio Jones can’t be traded because of his contract. Of course, the Patriots desperately need a WR. They can be in on Green, too. The Chargers can’t dump. Tampa Bay should trade Mike Evans, if the cap permits it. They don’t need two lead WRs, and they can get two first-round picks for him. I do think teams can do pretty much whatever they want with the cap, if they put the pain off until tomorrow.
neil: Would love to see the Patriots acquire yet another name-brand WR before season’s end. Just for their full list of receivers for the season to be even more bizarre.
Salfino: There just are not a lot of WRs out there on the bad teams. Allen Robinson? The Bears are going to keep lying to themselves that they’re fine.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I agree that Mitch Trubisky probably isn’t good, but he’s coming off an injury, so this week probably isn’t the best time to finally declare him a bust
Salfino: Marvin Jones to the Patriots for a first-round pick? Only the third player ever with two four-TD receiving games since 1950 (Rice and Sterling Sharpe).
sara.ziegler: The Vikings should trade away Kirk Cousins — like I did in fantasy football.
😉
neil: Hey wait, Sara! I got Cousins from you and was happy with him! LOL
(Also, my regular starter was on bye.)
Salfino: Wait a second! Sara traded Cousins to Neil? How am I just finding out about this?
sara.ziegler: It was a classic Cousins-for-Trubisky deal.
neil: I also got a Chipotle lunch out of it.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Jelly.
Salfino: Steal.

Let’s talk about the start of the NBA season, which tips off on Tuesday! We’ll begin with the Western Conference today and dig into the East on Tuesday.
I want to start with the team that still ranks No. 1 in our NBA Predictions, even after all the fancy changes we made to our model over the summer. Are you guys buying the Houston Rockets as championship favorites? Can James Harden and Russell Westbrook co-exist better than Harden and Chris Paul did (a partnership that reportedly soured by the end of CP3’s tenure in Houston)?
chris.herring (Chris Herring, senior sportswriter): I’m not. It’s not the craziest thought, but it would definitely surprise me if that happened.
natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): I mean, I think we’ve gotta reorient ourselves to a world in which there aren’t any teams as dominant as the Warriors.
Everybody has flaws. Everybody has warts. Everybody could use another player.
chris.herring: Except the Clippers, seemingly!
I really like their roster, and I think they’re close to being a complete team.
natesilver: The Rockets have been maybe the second- or third- or fourth-best team during the Warriors’ run — depending on how you count the Cavs and the one-year version of the Kawhi Raptors. And they’re the only one of those teams that’s still relatively intact.
So it’s not crazy to think they start as the favorites, sort of by default?
Even though RAPTOR does NOT actually like Westbrook very much and preferred CP3.
neil: Vegas agrees with Chris, for what it’s worth.
chris.herring: Yeah. Someone’s feeling on the Rockets — good or bad — probably has to be taking how they feel about Westbrook’s fit there into account.
natesilver: Vegas has never had a ton of respect for the Rockets, though.
tchow (Tony Chow, video producer): Wow, Nate, you know we have a new video series debating players. (See Giannis vs. Jokic.) CP3 and Westbrook was another one we were doing. Way to spoil the ending.
neil: LOL
natesilver: Is that the video series with a dinosaur in it?
neil: The premier Dinosaur-Suit-based NBA analysis video series on the web.
natesilver: Here’s the other tricky thing about debating championship odds: Some teams are going to have more ability to improve their rosters by the spring. And adding one player can make a BIG difference. Hell, we just moved Matisse Thybulle into the Sixers’ rotation, a player that RAPTOR happens to like a LOT, and even that move made a relatively big difference in their championship odds.
So … which teams can add another piece? I think the Rockets actually don’t do great on that front. The starting five is pretty set. Harden and Westbrook aren’t super easy to pair with other players. And there aren’t a lot of tradable assets on the roster.
neil: That’s a good point, Nate. John Hollinger had an interesting column over at The Athletic recently about how much this season could be defined by trade flexibility for contenders.
One admitted blind spot for our projections is that they’re in some ways based on how a team looks right now — see the Oklahoma City Thunder’s bullish projection, for example. So maybe that’s an area where the Rockets look good now but may not look as good later on.
natesilver: There are also optionality issues that are hard to model.
Like, the Clippers have several rotation spots where there are open competitions. And the odds are that the player who WINS the completion will be better than our projections.
chris.herring: The Clippers basically have two completely different lineups that look like they can do damage. I just think they have the best balance in the league, along with a team like Philly.
neil: Just how good can the Clippers be? They were the most improved team when we installed RAPTOR into our projections a couple of weeks ago, mainly because our new metric is pretty enamored with Kawhi Leonard and especially Paul George.
chris.herring: The very idea of Patrick Beverley, PG and Kawhi on the court at the same time defensively seems unfair.
natesilver: The Clippers’ frontcourt is kind of a mess.
chris.herring: !!!
natesilver: 

							It may be a fixable mess because it shouldn’t be that hard to acquire frontcourt talent at a reasonable price.
But, like, that frontcourt might prevent them from winning a title in the GSW era. In the new era? It’s survivable.
chris.herring: So I think they’re a different sort of team.
Their second-unit uses a ton of pick and roll, with Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell. So they don’t have to play out of the post much.
But I also think that, offensively, they may find a ton of success with PG and Leonard in the post.
The bigger question is whether they have the bodies, aside from Ivica Zubac and Harrell, who are comfortable down there defensively. It’s not completely ideal, and they’re def much better on the wings.
tchow: Let’s play GM for a minute. Who should the Clippers target before the trade deadline to make this lineup even more complete than it already looks on paper?
natesilver: I mean … Kevin Love?!? Los Angeles connections, postseason experience, post-up game, rebounding.
chris.herring: Yeah. It’s an interesting argument: Does adding another star make them better than having the depth other teams don’t? Especially if that player weakens them on defense?
natesilver: I’m not sure that Kevin Love is a star.
IDK, in the abstract like a Paul Millsap could be a good fit there. But Denver obviously has title contention dreams of their own.
neil: And L.A.’s only expiring contracts of note to fetch anybody in a trade are Harrell and Maurice Harkless.
natesilver: Williams also has a very tradable salary, and you could imagine that he could be moved.
The other thing you could do is trade for a point guard and play some smaller lineups. I’m not really sure there’s enough passing on that team.
neil: OK, let’s pivot to talk about other contenders in the West. If the conference champ isn’t either Houston or the Clippers, who is it? The Lakers have the second-best odds in Vegas, but our model likes the Nuggets and the Jazz to win more games. And is the media-at-large counting out the Warriors at its own risk?
natesilver: We have the Jazz projected for a better regular season than the Lakers, but the Lakers as being more likely to win the title. But, basically, RAPTOR is fairly bullish on Denver and Golden State and bearish on Utah and the Lakers, relative to the consensus, so I’m splitting hairs a bit.
With the Lakers it’s like, just as is the case on the Clippers, there are a lot of open competitions for rotation spots. Unlike with the Clippers, though, some of the players competing for those spots are not just league-average but BAD — y’know, like Rajon Rondo.
chris.herring: I don’t know what to make of the Lakers.
tchow: If you look at our projections right now, it gives a 61 percent chance of either the Rockets or Clippers making it out of the West. I don’t think anyone would look at that number and think we’re crazy. The team with the third highest chance of making it to the finals is … Golden State at 12 percent. That might be where I personally disagree with our projections a bit. (Sorry, Nate.)
natesilver: Steph Curry might still be the best basketball player in the world. Draymond Green might be the best defensive player in the NBA. Klay Thompson might be back for the postseason. D’Angelo Russell is … a piece?
chris.herring: To be honest, I kind of hate that the Warriors and Lakers have basically only played each other this preseason.
The Warriors haven’t looked all that great. They’ll improve, but I don’t think they have enough good bigs to where I feel comfortable projecting them winning it again.
tchow: Wait … looking at this closer, we’re projecting the Nuggets to have a better record than the Warriors (I buy that) but give them a lower chance of making it to the finals? Explain THAT, Nate.
natesilver:
Well, Tony, there are a couple of things going on:
Klay will probably be back for the playoffs.
We still give a small bonus for playoff experience, and the Warriors have that.
Rotations are shorter in the playoffs, which helps a thin team like the Warriors.
Draymond has historically been a much better player in the playoffs, and our model accounts for that, too.
tchow: Yeah … see … uh … I knew that. I just wanted you to explain it as a service to our readers. To be clear, I would NEVER doubt the projections.
natesilver: Literally LOL’ed at that in the Amtrak quiet car.
The Warriors are scary AF in the playoffs, is what I’m saying,
This season is also gonna be a big test for Kevon Looney, whom the advanced stats have always liked but who is going to be thrust into a much bigger role now.
neil: Even after everything that’s happened over the past half-decade, people still sleep on Steph and Draymond some, I think.
tchow: Since we’re on the Warriors, I just want to take a minute here to note that we talked about reorienting ourselves for this season because the Warriors aren’t the Warriors anymore. Also, they didn’t even win last year! (#WeTheNorth) But I do sense this sort of excitement heading into this season that no one really knows what’s about to happen. That’s kinda cool and can’t be overstated.
natesilver: This is the first season in a long time when you’re allowed to play with the Warriors in NBA 2K without it being lame.
tchow: Oh, guys! Someone made our Space Jam lineup in NBA 2K and is currently undefeated!!
chris.herring: They must be from the Pelicans, then.
natesilver: We should probably have a RAPTOR-ized 2K roster that you can download.
tchow: Sorry, I take that as a big personal win. OK, back to this season.
chris.herring: I still don’t know how the Warriors are going to play on offense.
Russell is a huge pick and roll threat, and the Warriors have always relied on pick and roll less than everyone else. And he clearly won’t be a plug-and-play replacement for Klay Thompson.
natesilver: I don’t think they have the option to NOT incorporate Russell fairly heavily.
chris.herring: And none of that even gets into the step back they’ll potentially take on defense. Or the fact that they look like they’ll be a subpar defensive-rebounding club now, as Golden State tied for the worst defensive rebounding percentage among NBA teams this preseason.
natesilver: Maybe Russell can become a different type of player. But they NEED his high usage rate.
chris.herring: True. But if that’s the case, I think they run the risk of looking ordinary when Steph isn’t extraordinary.
natesilver: Well, sure, they’re gonna be pretty ordinary without Steph. Perhaps a bit worse than ordinary, in fact.
The mercenary thing would be to turn around and trade Russell if Klay looks like he’s gonna be healthy.
chris.herring: If they were to flip him for a player who fit better, they could be scary again.
natesilver: I should say, though: I think people are too quick to assume that injured players will just come back at full strength.
chris.herring: That’s true, too
natesilver: We find, and this is now incorporated into the RAPTOR projections, that a player coming off a serious injury like an Achilles/ACL tear is going to be something like -1.5 points per 100 possessions worse in his first year back.
Which is a serious setback.
tchow: Wait. I’m sorry. When did Willie Cauley-Stein join the Warriors? I think it’s going to take me until the All-Star break to get used to all these rosters.
neil: This is the season of NBA Roster Shuffle mode.
natesilver: I mean, you really don’t want to look beyond “Kevon Looney” on the Warriors depth chart. You might hurt your eyes a little.
chris.herring: I just see something missing in their athleticism. I don’t think of Cauley-Stein as a huge difference-maker. But him missing training camp and not being there from the start seemingly hurts their bounce.
Looney fits them so well, but I’m not excited about the other bigs as much. And it shows so much when they’re playing the Lakers, who have Anthony Davis and JaVale McGee.
The Warriors honestly miss JaVale.
natesilver: The Warriors MAY benefit a lot from the buyout market.
The back end of their rotation is SO bad that even mediocre veterans who are -1.0 per 100 possessions would help quite a bit.
neil: How seriously should we take Denver and Utah as West contenders?
tchow: We have Denver projected to win 53 games and Utah to win 51 wins, which is more or less what they did last season (54 wins for Denver, 50 wins for Utah). I would put A LOT of money (if I had any) on both of them overachieving and making a leap this season, even if it’s just by two or three games.
natesilver: RAPTOR takes the Nuggets sorta seriously!
neil: Is that a Nikola Jokić thing?
natesilver: Holy shit does RAPTOR love Jokić, maybe because he’s the NBA player who looks the most like a T-Rex.
But, yeah, from RAPTOR’s standpoint, you have a legit superstar in Jokić, a player who’s ready to emerge as a major No. 2 sidekick in Jamal Murray, and a LOT of depth.
chris.herring: The Nuggets deserve to be taken seriously. Their pickup of Jerami Grant was one of the best ones this entire offseason. He fits them so well and gives them a lot of bounce. Michael Porter Jr. could be a big find for them, too.
natesilver: Some of that depth could probably be flipped for another starter-level talent, but the Nuggets have a lot of flexibility there, too. They have guys like Porter and Bol Bol and Jarred Vanderbilt who rebuilding teams might be interested in.
Utah, though, looks like more of a regular-season team to RAPTOR. It thinks that Donovan Mitchell needs to make a BIG leap forward — and that otherwise the Jazz lack the high-end scoring talent you usually need in the playoffs.
tchow: That’s disrespectful to Mike Conley.
natesilver: RAPTOR actually likes Conley a lot. And it loves Rudy Gobert. So this really is about Mitchell.
If you mentally plug him in as a top 20 NBA player, of course the Jazz start to look pretty scary. But RAPTOR doesn’t think he’s there yet.
chris.herring: The Conley acquisition was one that I saw as being largely for Mitchell. It’s to make it so he has less responsibility on offense while also giving the Jazz a ball-handler who is a scoring threat. Ricky Rubio wasn’t that.
Our system didn’t love the Bojan Bogdanovic pickup for them, but it gives them even more depth. Joe Ingles as a sixth man is terrifying.
neil: So it sounds like we’re basically higher on Denver than Utah as a West contender. Should I bring up the Blazers just so Portland fans don’t get too mad? They made the Western Conference Finals last year, but our model basically gives them a 3-in-5 chance of not even making the playoffs.
tchow: I put the Blazers in that “let’s wait until after the trade deadline” camp before we decide on what they can do this season. I could see them making some big changes.
natesilver: They made the Western Conference Finals because they were in a pretty easy part of the bracket. With Jusuf Nurkić back, it’s a more interesting conversation.
But they’re a thin team, especially at the 3 and 4 positions. I mean, we have Mario Hezonja getting a lot of playing time. They’re probably one starter AND one decent rotation player away from being a real title contender.
chris.herring: I didn’t love the Blazers’ trade for Hassan Whiteside. It seemed really un-Blazers-like to me. But they seem to have really great leadership with Damian Lillard, and maybe that helps keep Whiteside’s head on straight.
Either way, have a hard time seeing them contending.
neil: All right, before we finish talking about the West, what’s the one team you each have an eye on that we haven’t talked about yet?
(I think New Orleans will be a popular pick here, even with the injury to Zion Williamson.)
chris.herring: The news that Zion is expected to miss weeks of action to start the season because of a knee issue puts a damper on the excitement, even if it is the safest route to take for the long term.
tchow: The Lakers? I guess we “talked” about them, but not really.
neil: We mentioned them. LOL
natesilver: So, there are several young teams where our model is higher than the consensus. One of them is Oklahoma City. RAPTOR doesn’t like Westbrook, so it doesn’t think he was much of a subtraction. And it likes Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari a lot. And CP3. Of course, they could trade a lot of those pieces. So I’d take the under relative to our prediction. But if they keep the team together, it’s actually a pretty interesting group.
chris.herring: OKC is so difficult to project, because we also don’t know who’s going to be on the team come February.
neil: Yeah, I think the Thunder are the team our projections differ the most from something like Vegas on.
chris.herring: They lack depth, but I like their starting five. And I have a feeling that CP3 will soldier through since he’s the one name in Oklahoma now. Them getting to 40 wins wouldn’t surprise me. Even 45.
natesilver: Minnesota is sort of interesting. There’s upside there. RAPTOR figures that Karl-Anthony Towns will inevitably become a more effective player on the defensive end. It likes Robert Covington. It sees breakout potential for Josh Okogie and — yes — even Andrew Wiggins, who is just 24 years old somehow! Jarrett Culver might play some point guard, which would be big since Jeff Teague is a weak link in that lineup.
neil: Okogie was one of the players whose projection gained the most under RAPTOR compared with our old system.
(I feel compelled to say this as he is a fellow Yellow Jacket.)
natesilver: Yeah, RAPTOR loves the Marcus Smart-type players. And it figures that Okogie is one of those.
Good perimeter defenders aren’t easy to come by, and if they can shoot at ALL — and to be clear, Okogie couldn’t in Year 1 — they become quite valuable.
chris.herring: The Pelicans could be really solid, even with Zion’s injury. They have nice balance, and I think people forget that JJ Redick is there now. They have a little bit of everything, and they’re going to play fast, which opens things up for Zion, who had a historic preseason for a rookie.
tchow: The Pelicans have so many Duke players that they should actually consider changing their mascot at this point.

360 assaults or threats
A new report from the Government Accountability Office says federal employees overseeing U.S. public lands are experiencing more clashes with anti-government groups, including at least 360 assaults or threats over a five-year period. Investigators found incidents including threatening phone calls, gunshots fired over the heads of employees and a stabbing of a Bureau of Land Management worker outside of a federal building. The public lands include forests, parks, wildlife refuges and other open spaces covering more than 670 million acres mostly in a dozen Western states. [The Associated Press]
$260 million
Two Ohio counties have settled lawsuits against some of the country’s top drug distributors related to the opioid crisis. The $260 million deal includes $20 million in cash and a donation of $25 million in addiction treatment medications from Israeli drug manufacturer Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. CAH and AmerisourceBergen Corp. will give $215 million to counties that include the metropolitan areas of Cleveland and Akron. Thousands of lawsuits have been filed in almost every state over the country’s opioid epidemic, but the deal struck early Monday did not include a fifth defendant, Walgreens Boots Alliance, whose trial has been postponed.

84.8 percent of Democrats
Support continues to rise for impeachment of President Trump among Democrats and independents in polling analyzed by FiveThirtyEight. As of Monday, our impeachment polling tracker registered that 84.8 percent of Democrats and 46.4 percent of independents were in support of impeachment. Only 12.1 percent of Republicans were in support, but that’s up from 9.7 percent on Sept. 19, when news about the Ukraine scandal snowballed. FiveThirtyEight evaluates each poll based on the firm’s historical accuracy, its methodology, its recency and its sample size. [FiveThirtyEight]
11 deaths
Three days of violence in Chile have led to more than 1,500 arrests, dozens of reports of looting, a death toll of 11 people and a presidential declaration of a state of emergency. The crisis was sparked early last week by a youth protest against a 3 percent increase in subway fares, which escalated into a fare-dodging movement aimed at pressuring the government and the arson of at least a dozen stations by demonstrators on Friday. The damage was estimated at $300 million. [The Guardian]
8,000 snake rescues
If you think your job is bad, Pinyo Pukpinyo’s position in Bangkok’s Fire and Rescue Department has involved more than 20 painful snake bites. Sgt. Pukpinyo is the department’s chief snake wrangler, a job he started 16 years ago after removing a 14.5-foot python from a house. Since then, he estimates that he has “rescued” approximately 8,000 snakes; his department can receive 150 to 200 calls a day during Thailand’s rainy season. [National Public Radio]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-nbas-eastern-conference-really-just-a-two-team-race/,2019-10-22,,,features,"Oct. 22, 2019",Is The NBA’s Eastern Conference Really Just A Two-Team Race?,A FiveThirtyEight Chat,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): We chatted on Monday about the NBA’s Western Conference, in advance of the season starting tonight, so let’s talk about the East now. At the moment, our predictions say the two big favorites are the Milwaukee Bucks and the Philadelphia 76ers. The defending champion (and model namesake) Toronto Raptors are in a tier below with the Boston Celtics and maybe the Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat or Orlando Magic — if you squint. Does that sound right to you guys?
(The glaring absence from that group is Brooklyn, which our model has consistently been down on.)
natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): Yeah, it does. The East feels so … linear and predictable as compared with the West.
Or at least it does relative to itself. How Milwaukee and Philly stack up with the West contenders is an interesting question, of course.
chris.herring (Chris Herring, senior sportswriter): Yeah. As fun as the East was last year, I feel like there are only two contenders here.
natesilver: I’m not sure that Boston got as gutted as everyone thinks. I think they were overrated last year.
In the long run, I certainly prefer Kyrie Irving to Kemba Walker, but in the short run, I’m not sure it hurts them much, and it might be better from a chemistry standpoint.
chris.herring: Somehow, I think we’re all gonna watch one team join that upper tier, giving the East three contenders as opposed to two.
natesilver: The Celtics lost Al Horford, but RAPTOR is not as keen on stretch bigs like him as some of the other advanced stats, in part because playing guys like Horford tends to produce big offensive rebounding problems. Plus, he’s pretty old.
tchow (Tony Chow, video producer): From the standpoint of GAZE (General Assessment Zero Evidence — shoutout to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown!), I could see Boston joining that upper tier as we get further into the season.
I like Kemba on this team.
chris.herring: But what about Enes Kanter’s defense?!? Or lack thereof. I could see Boston falling off a lot, in that regard.
neil: It’ll be offset by the de-Kobefication of Jayson Tatum.
neil: Nate, you mentioned Horford. He ended up landing on one of the main East favorites: Philly. The Sixers were our summer favorites under the old system, but they lost a lot when we plugged in RAPTOR. Seems like so many of their guys — Horford but also (especially!) Ben Simmons — are not looked upon fondly by our new metric.
I think that Joel Embiid (and Josh Richardson, sorta) were their only main rotation guys who look better under RAPTOR than the old metrics.
natesilver: Yeah, nothing against Simmons, Neil, but he’s one of those guys who I’m “happy” got a deduction under RAPTOR.
Both the on/off stats and the eye test say he creates problems for his team.
neil: He’s making threes now! Haven’t you heard?

natesilver: I mean … that would help a LOT!
Even just having the credible threat of a wide-open three is important. His low free-throw percentage makes me wonder how realistic even that low bar is, though.
It’s not that Simmons is a bad player, by the way. It’s just that this narrative of the 76ers having two emerging stars in Embiid and Simmons isn’t right. They have one already emerged star in Embiid and one player who’s roughly league average in Simmons, who might or might not develop into something considerably better than that but plugs into the modern NBA in a slightly funny way for now.
chris.herring: Random, but can I just say that Matisse Thybulle looks really great in Philly? Excited to see how he fits in.
natesilver: Yeah, Thybulle is definitely a case where the stats match the eye test.
tchow: Not sure how much we should pay attention to preseason stats, BUT to hop onto that Matisse bandwagon, he averaged 2.6 steals per game this preseason and looks to be a top defender in the league.
natesilver: He averaged 3.5 steals per game (!) at Washington last year, and steals in college are one of the most predictive stats for NBA ability.
neil: So what do we think about how the Sixers compare to the Bucks in the battle to be East favorite, then?
It’s kind of amazing how even the two teams are in our forecast right now: We say Milwaukee has a 37 percent probability of winning the East and Philly is at 36 percent.
tchow: And they both have just about the same chance at winning the finals (Bucks at 15 percent, Sixers at 13 percent)!
chris.herring: I really wish that the Bucks had kept Malcolm Brogdon. I still think they should be favored, but I feel less strongly about them now than I otherwise would have.
natesilver: Yeah, the Bucks are NOT very deep.
They lost Brogdon and Nikola Mirotić. They didn’t lose Brook Lopez, but he may have had something of a career year, and I’m not sure they can count on him for as many quality minutes. And Eric Bledsoe may be hurt to start the year.
chris.herring: I don’t think their depth is that bad. But I just really like the guys they lost. I don’t trust Bledsoe a ton, but George Hill is pretty solid when he’s healthy. And I like Pat Connaughton and would like to see him get more minutes this season.
natesilver: RAPTOR kinda likes Donte DiVincenzo.
But the real question here is what Giannis Antetokounmpo looks like in lineups where you don’t have quite as much shooting and spacing.
chris.herring: I think their biggest question is: How good a second fiddle is Khris Middleton? Because a lot of people don’t trust him in that role.
tchow: Speaking of players that RAPTOR does not look upon fondly, what kind of year do we think Giannis will have following this MVP season last year?
chris.herring: Shoutout to me and Nate both throwing big questions out there about Milwaukee.
Giannis is gonna shoot 30 percent from three. And the next year, he’ll be league average from three.
tchow: Perhaps I’m being too harsh. RAPTOR sees Giannis as just fine. But I think there is a disconnect between how RAPTOR sees Giannis and how fans see Giannis.
natesilver: RAPTOR sees Giannis as basically the same as last year. Actually slightly better, since it expects him to play more.

Milwaukee constrained his regular-season minutes last year, which is not necessarily an option they’ll have this year with their decreased depth.
But yeah, RAPTOR sees Giannis as being like “in the conversation along with five or six other players for being the best player in the league” good, not “clear MVP already” good. And there’s actually a fairly big difference between category 1 and category 2. Part of it is that RAPTOR tended to like Brogdon, Bledsoe and the rest of the lineup.
So it doesn’t think Giannis made a great leap forward last year so much as that he’s a VERY good player who got into a MUCH better situation because of the talent and system around him under Mike Budenholzer.
neil: In that tier below Milwaukee and Philadelphia, we briefly touched on the Celtics. But what about the Raptors? RAPTOR on Raptor!

Vegas is giving them worse odds than the Pacers to win the East, much less the Celtics. But they still have a lot of guys — Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, Marc Gasol, Fred VanVleet — who RAPTOR likes.
natesilver: I mean, RAPTOR really liked the Raptors, but it also really liked Kawhi Leonard, so losing him takes a pretty big chunk out of them, obviously.
It’s actually a bit tepid on Siakam. One of those guys where the other advanced stats (BPM/RPM) were way ahead of where the conventional wisdom was on Siakam, and RAPTOR sort of splits the difference.
chris.herring: I think they may end up being fine. If they end up being the third-best team, I won’t be surprised at all. Siakam getting the spotlight will be fascinating because he has weaknesses that Kawhi didn’t.
But they also maintained a really good record without Kawhi last year, and he was a massive part of that.
tchow: RAPTOR puts Siakam in the “Average Starter” category with a predicted WAR of 5.1 for this upcoming season. I’m pretty sure we’ve already gotten some messages from Raptors fans for this.
natesilver: Siakam doesn’t quite have a standout offensive skill. And I wonder if that might get exposed more if he has to become a primary option.
chris.herring: His spin move is his standout skill! If it were a WWE move, it would be my favorite. He’s like the Tasmanian Devil of the NBA.
(I should trademark that.)
natesilver: 🌪
chris.herring: I think we’ll all be interested to see whether he can continue to be solid from the corners, like he was last year. But it’ll be pretty key for him to take the next step as a passer and creator along with Lowry and VanVleet.
Also, he’ll be the primary wing defender now without Kawhi or Danny Green being there.
neil: Let’s talk about the Nets for a second. They are the big outlier in the East between our model and Vegas — the bookmakers gave them 16-to-1 odds or so (about a 6 percent chance, not adjusting for the juice) to win the conference, while we give them next to no chance at all. What’s that all about?
natesilver: I can’t quite figure out why the oddsmakers have the Nets where they do for this season. Next year is a whole different question, when we’ll get into arguments about what a post-Achilles injury version of Kevin Durant looks like.
But I almost feel like the oddsmakers were like “wow, they added Kyrie and KD!!” and sort of hoped that people wouldn’t do the math and realize that KD is not playing in Year 1. Last year’s Nets + Kyrie – Russell is not necessarily a terrific team, especially since they likely overachieved a bit last year.
neil: There’s no chance KD comes back by, like, the playoffs, right?
(He’s been down that road before, rushing to get back in the playoffs. It did not end well.)
chris.herring: He really shouldn’t, under almost any circumstances.
natesilver: Yeah, I’d think this would be one of those times when you’d want to play it safe!
neil: Our model thought the Nets played over their heads most of the year, although some of that could have been due to the coaching of Kenny Atkinson. Maybe Kyrie is more motivated this year as well.
chris.herring: In fairness, their roster is pretty different in some ways.
natesilver: It also really, really dislikes the Nets’ centers. It thinks DeAndre Jordan is washed up. And it thinks Jarrett Allen looks bad when you look deeper under the hood.
neil: I can’t believe how much RAPTOR dislikes Allen.
chris.herring: I never know what to make of the projections thinking that a team underperformed one year vs. what’s to come the following year, when the roster has a key addition or departure.
tchow: Even with a really motivated Kyrie, I’m looking at this lineup and it does not look close to being a contender in the East. We’re giving them a 60 percent chance of making the playoffs, but I wouldn’t be surprised if a team like the Pistons take that seventh or eighth seed over Brooklyn.
natesilver: Yeah, that’s the thing — it’s not like that lineup looks that great to the eye test? They basically have nothing you’re super excited about at the 4 or 5 positions.
tchow: The GAZE, Nate. Stay on brand.
chris.herring: I’m curious to see what’s next for Jordan — at times, it didn’t look like he was trying last year in Dallas.
natesilver: Dinwiddie, LeVert and Harris are nice players, but they’re old enough that you shouldn’t project much future growth.
So a star-but-not-superstar in Kyrie, a league-average-ish-or-slightly-above backcourt and a pretty bad frontcourt gets you to around .500.
neil: What about some of the other next-tier East teams? Anybody you have an eye on as a dark horse?
tchow: The Knicks!!
natesilver: Tony.
neil: I was literally typing, ‘DON’T SAY THE KNICKS TONY.’
LOL
natesilver: I think the Knicks are a dark horse for how bad they might be.
neil: Cavs-Knicks II: The Re-Basementing
tchow: We have them as a 20-win team. That’s so harsh!
natesilver: Like, I’m not sure it’s out of the question that they’re worse than last year. They have exactly one player on the entire team, Mitchell Robinson, who we rate as above average.

And he’s only above average by 0.1 points per 100 possessions.
neil: They also have Kevin Knox, whose projection required us redoing our axis to present negative WAR on his player card.
natesilver: LOL’ed in the quiet car again.
It’s a roster that’s designed for tanking.
tchow: Julius Randle. Underrated. Ntilikina. Underrated. Dennis Smith Jr. Underrated. RJ Barrett. Rated.
That’s a more-than-20 win team.
natesilver: Lots of guys who like to shoot and aren’t very good at it.
tchow: OK. I’ll stop.
neil: “RJ Barrett. Rated.” 😂 😂 😂 😂
natesilver: RAPTOR doesn’t even think their long-term outlook is that bad! It likes Barrett’s upside just fine — it likes Robinson OK. It likes young point guards, and the Knicks have three of them, so maybe they’ll find something there.
But they’re NOT gonna be pretty to watch this year, in RAPTOR’s estimation.
tchow: A serious dark horse I would keep an eye on would be the Heat. Another one of those “they’re not done tinkering with the lineup” teams.
Are the Heat the Trail Blazers of the East?
chris.herring: NO
neil: Interesting comparison. Their Elo ratings are basically the same right now (although Portland has better playoff full-strength potential).
chris.herring: The Heat are on a hamster wheel of mediocrity. At least the Blazers made the conference finals.
neil: I thought the hamster wheel wasn’t viewed so negatively now! Tanking is so 2015.
tchow: I’m putting them both in the making-moves camp. I think both of their lineups will look very different come playoff time, which makes me hesitant to predict their outlook this season.
neil: Chris, I know you’ve written a lot about the Pacers over the years. Can they make any kind of leap into the conversation at the top of the East?
tchow: This seems obvious, but it all depends on Victor Oladipo, no?
neil: Sure. But they kept things afloat reasonably well without him last year, and he’s due back around midseason, if not earlier.
Then again, he’d be another case study for what Nate was talking about in our West chat, the effect of a major injury when a player is coming back. He was a borderline MVP-level player two seasons ago, before getting hurt last year.
chris.herring: I like the Pacers and love their pickups of Brogdon and Lamb. But I still think they may struggle to score at times. They have a shot to be good.
neil: And finally, let’s talk about my dark horse pick in the East (and former employer), the Atlanta Hawks. Anybody wanna tell me how they could win it all this year?
[….]
neil: OK, fine. It’s me and Trae against the world.

Astros pitcher Zack Greinke accumulated more than 6 WAR this season but was traded midseason, so his production was split between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Houston Astros.
Source: Baseball-Reference.com
The Nationals are one of 13 teams since the first World Series in 1903 to have three starting pitchers on their roster who produced 5 or more WAR — Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin — for that club in the regular season. They are the fourth such staff to reach the World Series, joining the 1991 and 1996 Atlanta Braves and 2005 Houston Astros. The 2019 Astros are one of 25 teams to have two starting pitchers exceed 6.5 WAR in the same season. This World Series pitching matchup is rivaled only by the 2001 Series, in which Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling of the victorious Diamondbacks faced Roger Clemens and Mike Mussina of the Yankees. Potential matchups of Cole versus Scherzer in Game 1, Verlander versus Strasburg in Game 2 and Greinke versus Corbin in Game 3 could mark some of the best Series matchups in history.
These staffs have also led a comeback in starting pitcher workload this October. There have been 16 outings of 101 pitchers or more made by starting pitchers, and the Nats and Astros have combined for 11 of them, nearly as many as the past two postseasons combined.
But while the Astros and Nationals have similar levels of elite pitcher talent, they built their rotations in very different ways.
Houston acquired Cole and Verlander via trades that so far have given the Astros much more than they gave away. The Astros helped Verlander fine-tune his slider to return him to peak form, and Cole has gone from so-so to unhittable. This season, Verlander and Cole joined Johnson and Schilling (2002) as the only pair of teammates to top 300 strikeouts in the same season. They figure to be competing against each other for the AL Cy Young Award.
The Nationals drafted Strasburg first overall in 2009, and even with Tommy John surgery under his belt, he has been the 10th-most valuable pitcher in baseball since his debut. In 2015 the Nats signed Scherzer, who has been the most valuable arm in the game since 2012. And from a pitching standpoint, it worked out well for the club when Bryce Harper turned down a reported $300 million deal to stay in Washington — the Nats subsequently signed Corbin and Aníbal Sánchez. Corbin outproduced Harper this season, in terms of WAR.
The Nationals finished first in the majors in starting pitching production, while the Astros ranked fourth this season. And Scherzer and Co. will have to be great to give the Nats a chance against the heavily favored Astros, who have a 60 percent chance to win the Series, according to FiveThirtyEight’s MLB predictions.
While the Nationals bullpen has been better in the postseason, only the Baltimore Orioles had a poorer bullpen ERA in the regular season. Even if one of the Astros’ better relievers, Ryan Pressly, isn’t 100 percent healthy, they figure to have an edge after the starters are out of the game. And though the Nationals have star bats like Juan Soto, Anthony Rendon and Trea Turner, the Astros are basically the 1927 Yankees. In fact, according to weighted runs created plus (wRC+) — a metric that adjusts for ballpark and scoring environments, with 100 representing league average — only the ’27 Yankees were a more efficient offense than the ’19 Astros.
Though the Astros and Nationals may have similarly dominant starting pitching, the Astros are stronger everywhere else. The Nats’ historically talented group of arms — along with their star position players — faces a nearly unprecedented challenge in returning a title to Washington.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-democrats-in-early-primary-states-dont-want-to-see-nominated/,2019-10-21,,,features,"Oct. 22, 2019",Who Democrats In Early-Primary States Don’t Want To See Nominated,Seth Masket,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"The still-very-crowded Democratic presidential primary has been polled pretty extensively this year, giving observers a sense of who’s doing well in their efforts to win over likely Democratic primary voters and caucusgoers and who is having a hard time gaining traction. And the polls have been shifting gradually over the last few months: Former Vice President Joe Biden retains his first-place standing while Sen. Elizabeth Warren continues to make slow and steady progress, and Sen. Bernie Sanders has slipped somewhat, although he has maintained support in the mid-teens for some time.
But despite many months of campaigning, there still isn’t a clear party consensus — there’s a clear top tier of candidates, but no runaway leader has emerged. So in a field this large, we have turned to asking people who they don’t want the Democratic nominee to be. One of us (Masket) has been doing this as part of his early-state activist interviews since April, and the other (Peterson) included this question in a recent survey he conducted with Iowa State University/Civiqs among likely Iowa Democratic caucusgoers. (Peterson is planning to ask the question again in followup surveys.) To be sure, our approaches measure different things — the preferences of a few dozen party activists aren’t necessarily the same as those of several hundred caucus goers — but we have found some similar patterns.
For starters, one of the most notable features of this primary field is just how many people don’t want to see Sanders as the nominee even though he’s currently third in the national polls. Obviously Sanders is backed by an enthusiastic set of supporters, but we’ve also found that he has a substantial number of detractors in the party. In Masket’s August early-state activist interviews, 59 percent of activists (17 of 29 people interviewed) said they did not want him to be the nominee (compared with 21 percent — 6 people — who said they were considering supporting him); only Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard earned worse marks (62 percent — 18 people — did not want either of them to be the nominee). Meanwhile, in that Iowa State University/Civiqs poll, 25 percent said they didn’t want to see Sanders as the nominee (compared with 16 percent who listed him as their first choice), giving him the second-worst marks of any candidate on this question.
The suggestion here is that Sanders is a factional candidate; a specific set of Democrats are very excited about him, but he has limited ability to expand that coalition into a broader base of support. For instance, in that Iowa State University/Civiqs poll, Sanders has struggled to win over new supporters — among those who didn’t back him in 2016, less than 1 percent want to see him become the nominee in 2020, and a third specifically do not want to see him nominated. Of course, that doesn’t mean Sanders cannot win the nomination — President Trump was arguably a factional candidate for much of the 2016 cycle — but it does mean Sanders’s potential for growth is limited.
Another candidate with a substantial number of detractors is … Biden. That’s right, even though he still sits near the top of the polls, he was the No. 1 candidate who likely Democratic voters said they did not want to see as the nominee (30 percent) in that Iowa State University/Civiqs poll. Likewise, in Masket’s August early-state activist survey, 31 percent (9 people) of those interviewed said they did not want to see Biden become the nominee. Granted, this was not anywhere close to the percentages who said they didn’t want Messam, Gabbard, or Sanders nominated, but it was still quite high given how many activists also said they were still considering Biden (34 percent, or 10 people).
It may be harder to think of Biden as a factional candidate than Sanders, given that Biden also enjoys significant support among a broad swath of demographic groups within the party, including a majority of African American voters. But he’s nonetheless facing a situation in which, if he did win, he might be a relatively controversial nominee who alienates some wings of the party or has trouble generating enthusiasm that can translate into voter turnout.
To be clear, this doesn’t mean Sanders and Biden are actively disliked by the party; both of them actually have high favorability ratings — 73 percent and 72 percent of Democrats had favorable opinions of Biden and Sanders, according to an average of national August polls by FiveThirtyEight’s Nathaniel Rakich. And if you look at Iowa surveys that also ask this question, Democrats have a fairly favorable view of both Biden and Sanders. But our question is different — we’re not asking whether respondents like a candidate; we’re asking who they don’t want to win the nomination. And while that question might capture some candidates who people dislike, it’s also entirely plausible that many Democrats like Biden and Sanders but still don’t want them to be the nominee.
Of course, it’s also plausible that Biden and Sanders experience more opposition than the other candidates because people simply know more about them — they both have high name recognition and long histories in politics. We found that candidates without such histories, like Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, weren’t really opposed yet by early-state activists or Iowa caucusgoers. This could change, though, as Warren’s new status as a front-runner means a good deal of criticism and media attention will be aimed at her, and the number of Democrats uncomfortable with her as the nominee may well rise.
One other thing to keep in mind is that it’s not entirely clear how strong this opposition to Biden or Sanders actually is. And that’s because this is a comparison among other Democratic candidates — and not a comparison to, say, Trump. Democrats care a lot about winning this year, so if either Sanders or Biden were to win the nomination, Democratic activists and voters who don’t want to see them as the nominee may still rally behind them. But it makes sense that the party would want a nominee who can speak to all of its key constituencies, or at least not alienate many of them. So as Democrats look to find a candidate who can not only keep the party together but also keep the party’s supporters enthusiastic about voting in 2020, they can’t afford to ignore the fact that some potential nominees are disliked by a substantial portion of the party.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Elizabeth Warren has moved into the top tier of the Democratic primary field in national polls, joining former Vice President Joe Biden. Further, she leads in Iowa and New Hampshire and raised more than anyone except Sen. Bernie Sanders from July through September.
And yet, according to our endorsement tracker, Warren isn’t getting much support from Democratic Party elites, such as elected officials and members of the Democratic National Committee. In fact, she doesn’t just trail Biden in endorsement “points” by our metrics, but also Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, who are both well behind her in polling and fundraising. Warren is fifth in endorsements from Democratic state legislators (behind Biden, Booker, Harris and Sanders), according to research by Boris Shor, a political scientist at the University of Houston. And it’s not just that Warren is getting stiffed by more centrist Democrats who might disagree with her on the issues: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota endorsed Sanders last week.
So what gives?
No one is getting many endorsements 
This is probably the simplest and best explanation. The clear leader in endorsements is really not Biden, but “undecided.”
By this point in the 2016 Democratic primary, in contrast, a huge bloc Democratic governors, senators and representatives had chosen a candidate, Hillary Clinton. But this cycle, the overwhelming majority of congressional Democrats and Democratic governors are still on the sidelines.1 Indeed, the 2020 Democratic primary looks more like the 2016 Republican primary, when most GOP officials held their fire until deep into the race, than that year’s Democratic race.

So a big part of the story here may be less about Warren and more about the large Democratic field and the lack of a clear front-runner, just as it was with Republicans in 2016. The big field, in particular, creates incentives for elected officials to remain neutral for as long as possible.
“For the faction of elected Democrats who want the party to move to the left, the fact that both Warren and Sanders are in the race and polling in the double digits makes it tough — and somewhat politically risky — to publicly choose between them at this point in the process,” David Hopkins, a political scientist at Boston College and co-author of “Asymmetric Politics,” said.
Or take members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “At this stage,” Hopkins said, “with Harris, Booker, and [Julián] Castro in the race and many of their constituents backing Biden, these members have other considerations besides candidate ideology — both in terms of their own personal objectives and their political incentives. Again, a wait-and-see strategy seems much safer.”
Democrats may also be gun-shy after the outcome of the 2016 election. Hans Noel, a scholar at Georgetown University and co-author of “The Party Decides,” said of party elites: “They controlled the process, and they lost.”
“They were also criticized for favoring Clinton,” he added. “I don’t think that Clinton’s losing means they made a mistake in favoring her, but I think most party activists aren’t so comfortable with that interpretation.”
The party elites are wary of Warren 
Warren has two obvious problems with party elites. First, there is the perception among some of them that her left-wing stands, such as Medicare for All, are too risky for the general election and decrease the party’s chances of defeating President Trump. For example, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not outright endorsed Biden or specifically declared that she does not support Warren, but Pelosi has argued that the party needs to have a big, sweeping electoral victory in 2020, and that such a win requires more moderate policies, like focusing on improving Obamacare instead of pursuing Medicare for All. Those are sentiments decidedly on the side of Biden and Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg and against Warren and Sanders.
Secondly, electoral considerations aside, there is a center-left wing of the Democratic Party that fundamentally disagrees with Warren’s more leftward positions. It’s hard to imagine some of these figures endorsing Warren before she has effectively already won the nomination. (That fits with Shor’s findings — Warren’s endorsers at the state legislative level are more liberal than the endorsers of any of the other candidates.)
These problems are not unique to Warren. Sanders was perceived as too far to the left by many Democratic elites in 2016; he got very few endorsements back then and is not getting many this cycle, either. (Sen. Amy Klobuchar actually leads Sanders in endorsement points.)
Warren also has a third challenge with party elites that is less obvious. The Massachusetts senator clashed with senior aides to President Obama for much of his tenure in the White House. She, like Sanders, isn’t quite in line with the party’s establishment. A Warren administration would probably be less likely to hire former Clinton (Bill and Hillary) and Obama aides in key posts than, say, a Biden, Booker or Harris one. So people connected with the party establishment (like many DNC members) may be fine with Warren but prefer other candidates for more self-interested reasons.
The endorsements we’re focused on miss some of Warren’s support 
For a variety of reasons, we opted not to track endorsements from groups (as opposed to individuals). So that leaves out, for example, Warren winning the backing of the Working Families Party, a liberal activist group that has chapters in 15 states and is influential in places like New York. Several of the other candidates, including Sanders, pushed hard for that endorsement, and it may be more valuable than the backing of a handful of members of Congress.
A strict count of formal endorsements also leaves out less official institutional support. The liberal activist groups under the broader “Indivisible” umbrella, MSNBC (particularly its more left-leaning hosts like Rachel Maddow) and Pod Save America aren’t likely to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary. But the general ethos of those organizations is closer to “Republicans are morally bankrupt and must be confronted aggressively,” than “Democrats can work with Mitch McConnell.” (Biden hints at the latter, Warren the former.)
Lara Putnam, a historian at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied Democratic activist groups like Indivisible that have emerged after the 2016 campaign, says that many individual Indivisible chapters don’t want to formally endorse a candidate in the primary. They fear endorsements would create divides and make it harder for those groups to unify for the general election. But Putnam also says that many of the activists involved in post-2016 anti-Trump organizing are backing Warren. And they are acting on that support through, say, Facebook groups that are separate from the respective larger anti-Trump groups these activists are also affiliated with. (An informal August poll done of its members by national Indivisible also showed Warren as the activists’ favorite.)
“Warren has a large number of potentially very influential supporters in the local grassroots space, and they are also the people most opposed to using public endorsements as a means of pressure to shape [the] primary contest,” said Putnam.
Similarly, we are tracking the designated Democratic leader in state legislatures around the country, so we counted Georgia House Minority Leader Robert Trammell’s endorsement of Harris, for example. But the endorsement of Warren by Lorena Gonzalez, a rising star in the state House in California, a hugely important primary state, isn’t captured in the FiveThirtyEight tracker, even though Gonzalez’s backing may be more significant than Trammell’s. Molly Kelly, who was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2018 in New Hampshire, is also backing Warren; that’s another fairly high-profile endorsement that doesn’t fit our metrics. Warren has the most endorsements from state legislators in Iowa, which might be more significant than federal legislators or state legislative leaders.
Does Warren’s lack of endorsements matter? 
Trump won in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada in 2016 and was well on his way to the GOP nomination before even a single Republican in Congress endorsed him. So in the anti-elite, anti-Washington, anti-establishment environment we are in right now, Warren might be better-off without a lot of endorsements. Another part of the story could be that the Warren campaign isn’t pushing particularly hard — or at least not as hard as other campaigns — to get endorsements from officials outside of the early primary states.
“She has little public support from party leaders, yet she’s in an increasingly strong position with liberal activists and the party grassroots and is pushing into a national lead among Democratic primary voters,” said Hopkins. “That in itself suggests that endorsements have limited value for candidates, perhaps especially for candidates like her who are presenting themselves as populists.”
He added: “We’re in an age when traditional party networks matter less in nominations and media presence matters more, so it just may not make much difference to voters who their member of Congress or state legislator tells them to vote for.”
Maybe. But we haven’t yet had a recent Democratic presidential primary with a nominee strongly opposed by the party elite. In fact, you could imagine a nightmare scenario for Warren, because of this lack of elite support. Let’s say she wins in Iowa and New Hampshire. Black and Latino members of Congress, still wary of her, downplay those wins by arguing that both came in heavily white states that are unrepresentative of the broader Democratic electorate. Someone like Obama, Pelosi or one of the Clintons says publicly, “A second term of Trump would be an existential crisis for America, and I’m worried that a candidate supporting fairly controversial policies like Medicare for All makes that more possible.” And in that scenario, maybe key figures in the party like David Plouffe, the manager of Obama’s campaign, endorse whichever more moderate candidate seems most viable at that point (likely Biden, Buttigieg or Harris.)
The potential danger for the Massachusetts senator is that “party elites lukewarm about Warren” turns into “party elites organize to stop Warren.” And perhaps Democratic voters care more about the views of their party’s elites than Republican voters did in 2016.
Even if that does turn out to be the case, however, Warren, well, seems to have a plan for that. The Massachusetts senator is reportedly privately talking to party elites, emphasizing that she is a team player and will take into account what’s good for the overall party if she is the Democratic nominee. That outreach, according to NBC News, includes regular contact with Hillary Clinton. That sounds like exactly what a candidate who wants to be accepted by the party establishment down the line, even if that establishment won’t embrace and endorse her right now.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

And as Sen. Elizabeth Warren becomes a front-runner, her lack of policy specifics for funding Medicare for All has become a chief criticism. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew digs into the politics of health care in the Democratic Party.
The team also checks in on the latest impeachment news after another busy week. Among other things, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters that military aid to Ukraine was tied to investigating Democrats and later walked his statement back.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/smu-is-undefeated-no-its-not-1982/,2019-10-18,,,features,"Oct. 18, 2019","SMU Is Undefeated. No, It’s Not 1982.",Josh Planos,FiveThirtyEight,College Football,"In his second season as head football coach at Southern Methodist University, Sonny Dykes — a noted appreciator of winning and potential coach of the year — has put the Mustangs back on the college football map. SMU is 6-0 for the first time since 1982 and recently made their first appearance in The Associated Press Top 25 since the Reagan administration.1
The NCAA all but killed the program in 1987, imposing the so-called “death penalty” that banned SMU from play for an entire season.2 The cellar may be a temporary place, but SMU built a home in it over the past quarter-century. Fans would be forgiven for believing it was permanent. But this year’s squad had no intention of staying put.
Hardly anybody outside of the SMU locker room expected such overwhelming success. Oddsmakers thought of this as a six-win outfit in the preseason, and the Mustangs have matched that projected total with at least half the season to go. Coaches in the American Athletic Conference saw a team likely to finish fourth in the West Division, so SMU went out and nabbed the top spot in the conference standings. They weren’t favored in the season opener against Arkansas State, so they went to Jonesboro and put up more than 500 yards of total offense in a win. Three weeks later, they were 7.5-point underdogs against a ranked TCU squad, so they went to Fort Worth and downed the Horned Frogs. ESPN’s Football Power Index still isn’t buying the Mustangs, giving them a 14.2 percent likelihood of winning a conference title and a 2.8 percent likelihood of winning out. If they follow the trend they’ve set so far, SMU will do both.

Which isn’t to say that SMU’s season has been successful in the conventional sense. The Mustangs are the only team to allow a touchdown when returning a kickoff. They’re the only team to win after entering the fourth quarter trailing by 21 points. They might be the only team to have had an offensive lineman’s helmet chucked 15 yards without drawing a penalty. For entertainment value, fans of the absurd can’t do much better than SMU, which seems to invent new reasons to tune in each week.
Alumni — and admirers of SMU football from the 1980s — must be tickled to see that the spark in Dallas has come on offense. The Mustangs score 42.2 offensive points per contest, the seventh-most in the nation. Only vaunted, traditional powers in Oklahoma, Ohio State, Alabama and LSU have scored more offensive touchdowns.
The Pony Express isn’t back, but not for a lack of effort by the SMU Mustangs. Nearly 40 years after Eric Dickerson and Craig James formed one of the greatest backfield tandems of all time, the Mustangs have reestablished their mojo in the same vein. Only eight teams are running the ball more than SMU, and only Wisconsin has more rushing touchdowns. Much of SMU’s ground game has been courtesy of Xavier Jones, who just wanted to cap his college career “with a bang.” He ranks 11th nationally in rushing yardage (646) and is tied for third in rushing touchdowns (12).
What’s more, Dykes is largely operating with a new roster. Starting quarterback Shane Buechele, leading receiver Reggie Roberson Jr. and leading tackler Patrick Nelson are all transfers. As The Athletic’s Chris Vannini noted, the program brought in 16 transfers this offseason, at least four more than any other team. In total, the team has 65 new players on campus this year.
Sometimes comparisons are best avoided. SMU has tied its best start to a season in school history, but it ultimately may not hold a candle to the halcyon days in which the Mustangs were “the best team money could buy.” An upstart season — one that could prove to be transformational — still hasn’t managed to mend the broken relationships between former players and the university. But even in the football-crazed state of Texas, who would have thought that SMU would return to relevance? If June Jones was the first to resurrect the program, Dykes is the first to show it can flourish in the modern era. SMU had gone over 30 years with just a handful of winning seasons after it faced crippling sanctions, but this year, a new chapter is being written in familiar ink.
Check out our latest college football predictions.
CORRECTION (Oct. 18, 2019, 5 p.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly described the ban applied to SMU’s football team in 1987. The school was banned from all play for the season, not just the postseason.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

300,000 students
Class for more than 300,00 students in Chicago officially halted on Thursday morning after teachers and support workers in the country’s third-largest school district went on strike. The Chicago teachers union is asking for bigger budgets to pay for salaries, classroom supplies, smaller class sizes and additional support staff. The last strike in Chicago’s school system happened in 2012 and lasted seven days. [New York Times]
55 mph winds
Incredible wind speeds as strong as a tropical storm have been hitting several parts of the East Coast due to a specific kind of weather phenomenon called a bomb cyclone. Hundreds of thousands of customers in several states don’t have electricity and dozens of flights have been delayed or cancelled due to high wind speeds, significant drops in air pressure and damaged infrastructure. Approximately one quarter of the residents in Maine lost power on Thursday. [United Press International]
20 sealed ancient Egyptian coffins
Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities says more than 20 sealed coffins, spread out over two levels of a large tomb, have been discovered by archaeologists in the city of Luxor. The “well-preserved sarcophogi” have been described by authorities as “one of the largest and most important discoveries to have been announced in the past few years.” The same ministry recently announced the discovery of an extensive industrial area comprised of 30 workshops which made pottery, furniture and other decorative items for royal tombs. [CNN]
$631 billion
A new report from the Society of Actuaries estimates the cost of the opioid epidemic to the U.S. economy is at least $631 million. Much of the amount is due to unrealized earnings from victims who died from the highly addictive painkillers, as well as health care costs between the study’s period of 2014 to 2018. The information was released as part of a landmark federal trial happening this week in Cleveland. [Washington Post]
1,479 vaping-related injury cases
On Thursday, federal health authorities said the number of lung injuries related to vaping grew to 1,479, and the number of deaths is now 33. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows almost 4 out of 5 of those injured have been under the age of 35. Many of the cases of vaping-related illnesses have occurred in users who said they had vaped products containing unregulated sources of THC. [Wall Street Journal]
2 bulls
In the world of dairy farming, the popularity of artificial insemination combined with a hyper-focus on top-producing female offspring means the lineage of most, if not all, of the American industry’s Holstein bulls can be traced back to two names: Round Oak Rag Apple Elevation and Pawnee Farm Arlinda Chief. After Penn State geneticist Chad Dechow and some of his colleagues figured this out, they realized it had also led to a significant decline in genetic variation. But now Dechow is trying to use old bull semen to bring back valuable genes that went missing, and show how they’re still great for producing milk. [National Public Radio]

But we are also interested in taking a deeper look into where these changes in support are coming from. For instance, what did voters who prioritize wealth and income inequality think of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who pitched her wealth tax? How about voters who prioritize health care — were they more likely to be impressed by candidates who back Medicare for All, a public option, or building on the Affordable Care Act?
To try to answer these questions, FiveThirtyEight partnered with Ipsos, using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, to talk to the same set of voters before and after the debate. Among other things, respondents were asked which policy issue was most important to them. Before the debate, the most common response was health care, followed by wealth and income inequality, the economy and jobs, and climate change.

From a survey of 3,360 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed between Oct. 7 and Oct. 14. The same people were surveyed again from Oct. 15 to Oct. 16; 1,761 responded to the second wave.
After the debate, when Ipsos re-interviewed respondents, there was some movement on which issue voters thought was most important — for example, the share of respondents selecting climate change dropped after the issue was barely mentioned in the debate, and the share who chose jobs and the economy rose after a lengthy discussion about the issue — but all of these changes were fairly small and within the poll’s margin of error.
Voters’ priorities, however, did influence how viewers thought candidates performed. For example, of the five issues we looked at,1 Warren received high marks from voters whose top issue was discrimination, climate change, wealth and income inequality, or health care (respondents graded candidates on a four-point scale, where higher scores are better), ranking first in the field in all four of those categories. But she didn’t do as well among voters whose top issue is the economy and jobs; instead, former Vice President Joe Biden got the highest rating from that group of voters, which comprised almost 13 percent of likely Democratic voters in our poll.

For the top five issues out of a set of 12 respondents could choose from. Uses respondents’ pre-debate answer for which issue is most important. From a survey of 3,360 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed between Oct. 7 and Oct. 14. The same people were surveyed again from Oct. 15 to Oct. 16; 1,761 responded to the second wave.
But it was health care — not the economy — that ranked as the most important issue to the largest number of voters in our survey. So what did those voters think? Turns out there wasn’t as clear of a consensus as to which candidate they thought did best. Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Biden all scored within a few tenths of a point of each other. And considering voters who cared about health care were by far the largest share of voters in our survey — 19.2 percent — a lack of an obvious winner on this issue may mean that a large group of voters are still deciding which candidate’s health care approach appeals the most to them. This muddledness also reflects some of the polling on different Democratic health care policies proposals. For instance, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll from October found that 71 percent of Democratic voters favor Medicare for All, which respondents were told would mean everyone got their health insurance from a government plan, but 85 percent also favored a public option, wherein a government policy would compete with private plans.
Voters who said wealth and income inequality was their top issue liked Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg but ranked Biden half a point lower than Warren. The breakdown was similar for voters who said they cared most about climate change. These voters gave Warren, Buttgieg and Sanders the highest scores while Biden again struggled somewhat with this group. But among voters who said they prioritize racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia and other forms of discrimination, Biden actually earned the second-highest rating, after Warren.
But did the candidates’ performance at the debate translate an increase in the share of voters considering supporting them?
Among voters who prioritize the economy and jobs, Warren actually gained the most potential support of any candidate — a 6.7-point increase — while Biden lost some potential support. But it’s important to put these numbers in context: Before the debate, 31.6 percent of voters who prioritize the economy said they were considering Warren, and after the debate, her shared jumped to 38.3 percent, but that’s still dwarfed by the 72.7 percent of voters who care about the economy who were considering supporting Biden before the debate. (Respondents could choose multiple candidates, so total support adds up to well over 100 percent.) Warren’s gain among these voters may have come at Sanders’s expense. Before the debate, Sanders had the second-highest share of potential supporters among this group, and after the debate, he slipped behind Warren, putting him in third.

For the top five issues out of a set of 12 respondents could choose from. Uses respondents’ pre-debate answer for which issue is most important. From a survey of 3,360 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed between Oct. 7 and Oct. 14. The same people were surveyed again from Oct. 15 to Oct. 16; 1,761 responded to the second wave.
Among voters who prioritized income inequality and climate change, Biden, Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar all made headway, but they still lag behind Warren’s commanding lead in both of these policy areas (almost 70 percent of people prioritizing each of the two issues are considering her, compared to under 50 percent for the runner-ups). Candidates also made gains on issues where they already enjoyed substantial support. Biden, for instance, gained almost 10 percentage points among voters who prioritize racism, sexism and other types of discrimination — a group where he already had the most potential support of any candidate. The share of voters considering him increased from 56.6 percent to 66.2 percent after the debate. Harris, Booker, Warren and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke also gained potential supporters among those who prioritize discrimination, but even with these gains, none of them came close to the share of these voters considering Biden. And aside from this small gain, Harris had a tough night, losing support across three of the five issue areas.
But among voters who prioritize health care — which was the most-selected top issue in our survey — there was little sign that voters were coalescing behind a single candidate. After the debate, Biden had the highest share of potential support among these voters — 59.7 percent — but he was closely followed by Warren at 51.2 percent, meaning that at least some health-care-focused voters are considering both candidates despite their divergent views on which direction health care policy ought to move. (Biden has proposed a public option while Warren supports Medicare for All.) And with health care voters divided between these different visions — a split that has gotten ample airing in the debates — the question of who will win over these voters may well be a deciding factor in how the primary shakes out in the coming months.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dj-lemahieu-is-the-new-derek-jeter/,2019-10-18,,,features,"Oct. 18, 2019",DJ LeMahieu Is The New Derek Jeter,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"On the 161st Street subway platform, and massed in and around Yankee Stadium for Games 3 and 4 of the American League Championship Series, plenty of fans were adorned in Yankee jerseys bearing No. 2, the number of franchise icon Derek Jeter. But there was also a new number emblazoned on many jerseys and T-shirts: No. 26, the identifier of DJ LeMahieu. The first-year Yankee star has won over skeptical fans who were initially disappointed that he was the club’s big position player free-agent signee last winter, not Bryce Harper or Manny Machado.
But it shouldn’t be surprising that LeMahieu has won over so many in New York. No player since Jeter has hit more like Jeter than LeMahieu.
Jeter’s trademark inside-out approach to hitting gave him an unusual batted-ball profile and helped him to 3,465 career hits. Of all major league hitters with at least 1,000 at-bats since 2002, the only right-handed batter to hit a higher share of opposite-field balls than Jeter and also come close to hitting his share of ground balls1 — all while batting .300 — is LeMahieu.2 Jeff Sullivan noted the similar profiles last offseason for FanGraphs after the Yankees signed LeMahieu to a two-year, $24 million contract. And LeMahieu has only continued to hit more like Jeter.

Yankees GM Brian Cashman told reporters earlier this month that his front-office assistants were pounding the table for signing LeMahieu last winter, and none more so than Jim Hendry, special assistant to Cashman. Hendry, the former Cubs GM, is close friends with LSU’s Paul Mainieri, who coached LeMahieu on the 2009 national championship team. Hendry had followed LeMahieu at LSU and through the minor leagues, and he thought the second baseman’s swing — and his versatile glove — would play anywhere.
“What I loved about him in college was that his natural swing was to right field and dead center, and he did it with a little bit of authority,” Hendry told FiveThirtyEight. “You can teach a guy to pull the ball down the road a lot easier than if you’ve got a pull guy, who isn’t a 40-homer guy, to hit the ball hard the other way. His natural swing was what I loved about him to begin with.”
That natural swing should feel very familiar to Yankee Nation.






While most ground balls are pulled, balls in the air are typically distributed more evenly around the outfield. Yet Jeter and LeMahieu own some of the most prolific opposite-field line-drive and fly-ball seasons on record since 2002, when batted-ball data became available. Among batters with at least 1000 at-bats since 2002, Jeter and LeMahieu rank second and third, respectively, in terms of the share of balls hit in the air to the opposite field. In an age of trying to pull the ball, LeMahieu is doing the opposite — just like Jeter did. Consider the Jeter and LeMahieu spray charts of balls hit in the air, from their five most recent seasons:


In his age-27 to age-30 seasons, Jeter produced a .305/.373/.456 slash line with a 118 OPS+, while LeMahieu compiled a .316/.373/.463 slash line with a 111 OPS+ in those corresponding seasons.
There were concerns that LeMahieu’s stats had been inflated by the thin air in Coors Field, where he spent seven of his first eight years in the big leagues. But LeMahieu’s offensive production has never been dependent on home run totals, so perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that he has succeeded away from Denver. If anything, the switch to Yankee Stadium and its short right-field porch helped him hit a career-high number of home runs (26) this season. Twelve of those home runs — including 11 at Yankee Stadium — were to right field, which tied for the fourth-greatest total in baseball.
“That’s his natural swing,” Hendry said.
LeMahieu’s batted-ball distance on fly balls to the opposite field also jumped by 22 feet to 324 feet this season, seventh in baseball. He hit a combined nine home runs to the opposite field from 2015 to 2018. Moreover, he has produced the most batted balls — including ground balls — to the opposite field this year. Those batted balls have come with a weighted runs created plus (wRC+) of 185, meaning that his opposite-field hits are 85 percent above league average in offensive performance.3
LeMahieu’s high-contact approach has made him even less dependent on ballpark environment. That method is perhaps aided by letting pitches travel longer before making contact, explaining his opposite-field tendencies.
LeMahieu’s approach might also be shift-proof, at least when it comes to infield defense. He led baseball this season in terms of plate appearances with a ball put in play when a shift was not in place. But in 2017, his batted-ball profile on balls in the air was so dramatic that teams employed some unusual outfield shifts. Since 2017, he has faced the second-most shifted outfield defenses in baseball.
While he doesn’t run like Jeter did in his prime or play shortstop — New York was drawn to him in part for his defensive versatility — LeMahieu does hit like Jeter. And Hendry also believes that LeMahieu excels in pressure situations. “He’s quiet, but the moment never gets to him,” Hendry said. And with New York trailing the Astros in the ALCS, the Yankees now need that calm under pressure more than ever.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Rihanna once sang, “Nobody text me in a crisis.” She would not be very useful in impeachment inquiry-era Washington.
Today’s Spin Cycle talks to someone who should be texted in a crisis — a PR professional. We’ll look at how the central actors of the impeachment inquiry are handling the cascade of news and revelations. But first let’s review the events of the last week.
For the Trump White House in particular, it’s been seven days of rolling tough breaks. For starters, a stream of State Department officials defied the White House directive that they ignore congressional subpoenas. On Thursday, October 17, Gordon Sondland, Trump’s ambassador to the European Union, testified that the president ceded control of Ukraine policy to Giuliani and didn’t listen to career diplomats. Sondland’s testimony followed that of former Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovonovich, who said on October 11 she was removed from her post because of a Giuliani-backed smear campaign. On October 14, Fiona Hill, a former top Russia advisor to the White House testified that Giuliani was running a shadow Ukraine policy and that former National Security Advisor, John Bolton, had called Giuliani a “hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up.” (Bolton, for context, believes in the value of initiating a first-strike nuclear attack.)
Giuliani, for his part, is reportedly the target of a criminal investigation about his work in Ukraine.
Apart from Sondland’s testimony, Thursday also saw acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney self-immolate during a press briefing when he conceded that there had been a quid pro quo having to do with American aid to Ukraine, just not about the Bidens. Mulvaney said that the White House asked the Ukrainians to look into whether Ukraine, not Russia, had a hand in hacking Demoratic National Committee’s servers during the 2016 election. Later, Mulvaney released a statement saying that the press had twisted his words. The press conference was, of course, video-taped and you can watch Mulvaney’s own words here.
The bad news doesn’t stop with the Ukraine story. Republicans are in open revolt over Trump’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, leading to a slew of massacres of the Kurdish people and the release of ISIS prisoners. Sen. Lindsay Graham, an outspoken Trump defender, called the decision “the biggest mistake of his presidency.”
I wanted some insight into how a White House — not necessarily the Trump White House — might be dealing with their multiple-front PR crisis, so I called Jamaal Mobley, director at the public relations firm, The Brunswick Group, who is based in Washington and has experience in corporate crisis communications.
The biggest risk in a crisis situation like the White House’s, Mobley told me, are the unknowns. His first step is typically to gather the facts so that he can grasp the totality of an issue. And in the case of Trump’s current crises, there’s one man generating a lot of unknowns. “Where I would be concerned is around what Giuliani’s role was and what he actually did,” Mobley said.
Fact-gathering aside, Mobley says the most critical thing is to put your client in a “leadership position,” a slightly vague term that basically means conveying an air of decisiveness and control, and putting your best foot forward even as the world falls down around you. The British stitch it on pillows: “Keep Calm and Carry On.” While Trump might be facing incoming fire from an array of issues and individuals, he’s remained attentive as ever to his beloved and much-discussed base of voters. In the past week or so, Trump held two large campaign rallies. In Mobley’s view, that’s smart, since the rallies have worked to fire up his voters in the past.
“They’ve been successful because it’s what his audience is looking for from him and he doesn’t really veer from his core audience in terms of messaging,” he said. “There’s a lot to President Trump but there are some lessons that I think corporate leaders should take from him with regard to understanding audience, prioritizing audience and creating messaging that focuses specifically on them.”
The Democrats certainly had a slower week than Trump and the Republicans, but it was still action-packed by normal standards. At the debate Tuesday night, multiple candidates said Trump is “the most corrupt president ever,” or some version thereabouts.
They were less interested in bringing up Hunter Biden, who spun his involvement in the Ukraine scandal by appearing in a televised interview with ABC News. He dismissed allegations that he had done anything untoward in accepting a board seat with a Ukrainian company while his father was the Vice President. The kind of still-legal nepotism that allows a powerful man’s son to sit on the board of a company to enrich himself isn’t exactly a comfortable topic for Democrats. Biden said that he would quit the board of a Chinese company and not work for any foreign companies if his father is elected.
When asked by moderators about his son’s involvement in Ukraine, Biden said, “My son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. That’s what we should be focusing on.”
Ultimately, Mobley told me, it was probably a good thing that Hunter took to TV, even if he didn’t make any admission of wrongdoing. “It was good for Hunter to be seen as accepting ownership of the situation even if he wasn’t accepting blame,” he said. Biden’s ultimate goal is to win the nomination, and the Hunter statement, awkward as it might be for the former vice president, is, in Mobley’s view, about demonstrating leadership by being as transparent as possible.
If the “leadership” talk sounds a bit like c-suite buzzwordery, it’s because it is. But Mobley’s point is that in politics, particularly the U.S.’s viciously partisan variety, a PR strategy that demonstrates any kind of authentic “alpha” action is what wins people over, no matter what you’re selling. Democrats and Republicans are going to probably spend the next weeks and months trying to paint themselves in leadership terms. Their definitions of leadership might differ, but their end goals remain the same: to be the most convincingly assured presence to the majority of the public … or at least a plurality. In the end, Americans will make their decisions with their guts. And in this political moment, it’s no mistake they’re doing so.
“There’s a mistrust of institutions, there’s a mistrust of individuals who are in leadership positions and the only thing that people believe in is a person who speaks with conviction and speaks with directness,” Mobley said. “That’s the only way you’re going to convince someone.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

9 years of seclusion
Bartenders hear a lot of secrets while pouring drinks, but Chris Westerbeek heard an especially unusual one when a “scruffy young man” downed five beers and revealed it was his first time outside in nine years. The 25-year-old was one of six family members who had been locked inside a secret room in a farmhouse near the village of Ruinerwold, in the northern Netherlands. Prosecutors said the 58-year-old man who paid the rent on the property will appear in court on Thursday on charges of unlawful detention and harming others’ health. [Reuters/The Mercury News]
3,271 pounds of hydrofluoric acid
Earlier this year a refinery blew up in Philadelphia, releasing dangerous chemicals into the atmosphere. A new report details just how dangerous those chemicals were. An estimated 3,271 pounds of hydrofluoric acid were released, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is so poisonous that ingesting a small amount of it, or getting small splashes of it on your skin, can be fatal. The explosions were so powerful they launched a piece of debris similar in weight to a Greyhound bus several hundred feet away. [WHYY]
51 deaths
The National Safety Council says 51 American children have died so far this year from heatstroke after being left or getting trapped in cars. While most of these deaths happen during the much warmer summer months, they can still happen at other times of year, such as the 1-year-old who died on Monday in Florida after she was left inside a hot Jeep for several hours. Last year, the National Safety Council said 53 children died of heatstroke, a record number, with the last death happening in September. [KXLH]
Nearly 1 in 5 names
Ohio had planned to purge 235,000 voters from its rolls last month. Only problem: almost 20 percent of them weren’t supposed to be on the list. Jen Miller, the director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, discovered her own name was erroneously on the spreadsheet as “inactive” despite voting three times last year. Advocacy groups discovered around about 40,000 other names should not have been on the list through crowd-sourced efforts. [New York Times]
500 miles
Concerns about hot summer temperatures have led the International Olympic Committee to detail a new plan to stage the marathon and race walking events in the city of Sapporo, the site of the 1972 Winter Olympics, but 500 miles away from the other events in Tokyo next summer. The IOC cited “significantly lower temperatures for the athletes” for the proposal, but at least one athlete has expressed dismay at the lack of consultation. “I’m assuming this means you’ll be paying for my family and friends flights and accommodations who have already booked for Tokyo?” past 50K bronze-medalist Evan Dunfee wrote on Twitter.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-october-democratic-debate-in-6-charts/,2019-10-17,,,features,"Oct. 16, 2019",The Fourth Democratic Debate In 6 Charts,Laura Bronner,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Last night, 12 candidates duked it out in Westerville, Ohio, in the fourth Democratic debate. Sen. Elizabeth Warren built on her past debate successes, receiving high marks from both voters who care more about defeating President Trump and voters who care more about a candidate whose positions they agree with. But she was not the only winner in the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar had strong performances, too, and used the debate as an opportunity to push back on whether Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders’s progressive policies are realistic.
We will be keeping an eye on the polls to see if Warren’s solid performance will help her pull ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden, or if Buttigieg and Klobuchar will manage to shore up more support. But for now, here’s a look at how the candidates performed, summed up in six charts:
Which candidates performed the best?
First, we wanted to see which candidates impressed the viewers we surveyed. To do this, we compared each candidate’s pre-debate favorability1 to debate-watchers’ rating of their performance to see if any well-liked candidates disappointed during the debate or if any less-liked candidates received good ratings. By this metric, Klobuchar and Buttigieg were the two candidates who exceeded expectations given their pre-debate favorables, though Warren still received the highest debate grade overall.
Warren performed well among voters who care about defeating Trump
In our poll, about two-thirds of Democratic voters said they value a candidate who has a good chance of beating Trump over someone who agrees with them on the issues — and that didn’t change after the debate. So with “electability” central to the election thus far, we wanted to see whether there was a difference in debate performance evaluations from respondents who said they cared about electability and respondents who said they cared about issues. Differences were small, but there are a few things that stand out.
First, even though Warren has pitched herself as the “issues” candidate — and she did do well among voters who care about the issues — her performance also appealed to respondents who said they prioritized defeating Trump. In fact, they rated her performance higher than that of any other candidate. Sanders also got high ratings from both voters who care more about defeating Trump and voters who care more about the issues, which means candidates making more issued-based appeals can still do well among voters who care about defeating Trump. But it’s a tricky balance. Buttigieg and Biden, for instance, did not do quite as well among voters who cared about the issues, but they did almost as well as Warren among voters who care about beating Trump.

Who made a positive impression?
We also wanted to see how viewers’ opinions of the candidates changed as a result of the debate. So, to see who made a positive (or negative) impression, we calculated the candidates’ net favorability (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) before and after the debate.
Although both Buttigieg and Klobuchar were on the attack, their net favorability increased by 2.6 points and 3.2 points, respectively. That said, even with her modest bump, Klobuchar is still not viewed as favorably as candidates like Buttigieg, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Kamala Harris. And not every candidate made a positive impression: former Rep. Beto O’Rourke lost the gains he made in the last debate and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s return to the stage did not impress viewers either.

Who spoke the most?
Warren got her first taste of being the race’s front-runner, and spent much of the debate deflecting other candidates’ attacks. She spoke almost 3,700 words — more than any other candidate and 600 words more than the second-most-prolific talker, Biden. This is a notable change from the September debate, when Warren was third in words spoken behind both Biden and Booker. Impressively, O’Rourke and Klobuchar — who were both near the bottom for words spoken in the last debate — clocked in at third and fourth in words spoken, respectively. They surpassed Booker, who after being second in words spoken last time spoke the fifth-most words last night.

We also compared the number of words candidates spoke to their polling average, to see if higher-polling candidates spoke as much as expected or if lower-tier candidates managed to steal the mic. (The polling average is based on nine debate-qualifying polls released since the third debate on Sept. 12.)
O’Rourke and Klobuchar way outspoke their lower polling averages. Warren, Buttigieg, and Harris also outperformed their averages, but not by as large of a margin. On the other hand, Sanders and Biden held the floor less than we might expect considering their standing in the polls.

As a group, the candidates mentioned Trump’s name almost twice as often as in the previous debate — perhaps because the first question asked about impeaching the president. Once again, though, Harris mentioned Trump the most. Candidates who barely mentioned the president by name in the last debate — like Klobuchar (0), Buttigieg (1) and Andrew Yang (2) — name-dropped Trump more often, too, trailing only Harris in number of mentions. After saying Trump’s name the second-most number of times in the previous debate, former Cabinet secretary Julián Castro dropped to the bottom of the group. The candidates who held the floor the longest, such as Warren, Biden and O’Rourke, didn’t mention Trump as much as the other candidates who spoke less.
While the September debate — the first one-night event — was watched by about 15.3 million viewers, preliminary ratings indicate that this debate drew just over half of that, a mere 8.3 million people, despite featuring two more candidates. Interest may be dropping, but the debates will go on: The next debate is scheduled for Nov. 20, and so far eight candidates have qualified.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-aoc-and-omar-endorsements-could-help-sanders/,2019-10-17,,,features,"Oct. 17, 2019",How The AOC And Omar Endorsements Could Matter,Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"FiveThirtyEight has been tracking endorsements throughout the Democratic primary. There have been more than 150 of these so far, out of the fairly broad universe of potential endorsers that we’re monitoring. But most endorsements don’t make national news.
Tuesday night was an exception — probably the first time all cycle that an endorsement has led the news cycle. Just as the fourth debate was concluding, reports surfaced that at least two of the four members of the “The Squad,” a group of first-term congresswomen who are outspokenly on the left of their party and often critique their party’s leadership, would be endorsing Bernie Sanders. Specifically, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota has already officially announced her endorsement of Sanders, and Rep. Alexandia Ocasio-Cortez of New York will reportedly endorse Sanders at a rally in Queens this weekend. (Contrary to earlier reports, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan has not yet officially endorsed Sanders. A fourth member of “The Squad,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, has no imminent plans to endorse Sanders or anyone else.)
I have quite a few thoughts about this, which partly go to how I think Sanders’s campaign, and Elizabeth Warren’s, are going overall. If you want a takeaway headline, though, it’s basically that this is the kind of thing I’d want to see more of from Sanders. In other words, it’s good news for him, but it will be better news for him to the extent it presages a more coalition-oriented approach to running a campaign, which includes building alliances with diverse groups of voters and winning endorsements in an effort to expand his coalition. If, on the other hand, it signals a desire by Sanders to provoke an establishment vs. anti-establishment confrontation with Warren, I’m not sure that’s as helpful to him. OK, here we go: Nine quick-ish thoughts about the AOC and Omar endorsements of Sanders:
1. There’s reason to think endorsements matter. Historically, endorsements have been a good predictor of presidential primary outcomes, often rivaling early polls for how well they anticipate how the vote will eventually turn out. The theory behind the importance of endorsements, as perhaps best articulated in the book “The Party Decides”, has come under attack in recent years, mostly because Donald Trump’s nomination in 2016 despite a lack of support from Republican endorsers was a poor data point for the theory (to put it kindly). In addition, some Democrats who received a number of endorsements earlier this year, such as Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, have not yet gained much traction in the polls. Nonetheless, the theory has a fairly good long-term track record. Incidentally, the theory is not necessarily that the endorsements directly influence voters — for instance, that a voter says to herself “Senator Such-and-Such is endorsing Governor So-and-So; guess I’m going to vote for So-and-So!”. (Although, an endorser with as high a profile as Ocasio-Cortez could be an exception.) Rather, it’s that endorsements are a proxy for support from “party elites,” and that party elites’ preferences tend to be a leading indicator of voter preferences.
2. But endorsements matter more when they cross ideological lines — and these ones were more predictable for Sanders. Imagine that, rather than AOC and Omar, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin had endorsed Sanders on Tuesday night. That would have been quite surprising, given that Manchin is fairly conservative while Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist. It would have sent a signal, however, that Sanders’s populism could resonate beyond his left-leaning base. Ocasio-Cortez and Omar, by contrast, are more in line with Sanders’s current base, being both quite left-of-center and quick to rebuke the Democratic Party establishment. Those sorts of endorsements matter less, according to “The Party Decides.”
3. The timing was smart for Sanders, and will help to fend off the media narrative that his chances are fading. This is a very pundit-y type of observation, so I’ll be brief. But dropping these endorsements after a fairly strong debate for Sanders1 — and after concerns about the long-term viability of his campaign following his heart attack — strikes me as smart. It could contribute toward a “Bernie comeback!” narrative, especially if Sanders gets a boost in post-debate polls.
4. This is going to intensify intra-left fighting. Want a fairly safe prediction? The primary is going to get nastier. In my read of the various Warren vs. Sanders spats, they’re less about who is further to the left per se and more about how to achieve change, with Warren wanting to work within the Democratic Party and Sanders wanting to upend the Democratic Party and “the system” overall. (To bring about a “political revolution,” as Sanders might say.) One reason I’ve been skeptical about Sanders’s chances of winning the Democratic nomination is that while seeking to upend the system is perfectly valid as a theory of change, it’s a fairly hard way to win a party primary when the party sets the rules, those rules are designed to achieve consensus rather than to reward factional candidates, and voting is restricted in many states to party members. In any event, because Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have a somewhat anti-establishment message — although less so than Sanders himself does — their endorsements are likely to send additional tremors down emerging Sanders-Warren fault lines.
5. “The Squad” is a potential general election liability. A July poll by YouGov found all four members of “The Squad” with negative net favorability ratings among adults nationwide: -17 percentage points for Omar, -16 for Tlaib, -14 for Ocasio-Cortez and -11 for Pressley, although they remain relatively unknown to many voters. (I’d love to cite a wider sample of polls, but I can’t find many others that asked about Omar, Tlaib or Pressley. A number of earlier polls on Ocasio-Cortez found her with negative ratings, however.) They are reasonably popular among Democrats, of course, and Sanders’s objective for now is to win the nomination, not the general election. His campaign has sometimes tried to emphasize his “electability”, however, and these endorsements won’t necessarily be helpful in that respect.

6. Warren has some tough decisions about whether to lean to the left or the center. One tempting strategy for Warren might be to essentially concede that Sanders is further to the left than she is. Step back and let swing voters associate Ocasio-Cortez and Omar with Sanders, not her, for instance. That doesn’t necessarily mean giving up on voters who identify themselves as left-wing. But it would mean not trying to outdo Sanders by moving further to his left. And it might mean subtlety trying to convey the idea that she’s actually the compromise choice between Sanders on her left, and Joe Biden on her right.
This could be risky, for various reasons. Warren’s current coalition relies a lot on support from the left; 50 percent of “very liberal” voters in the most recent Quinnipiac poll say they prefer Warren, as compared to just 11 percent for Sanders. Meanwhile, trying to strike a middle ground has been difficult for candidates such as Kamala Harris. On the other hand, voters (backed up by a lot of political science research) tend to perceive more moderate candidates as being more “electable,” and electability perceptions have been a problem for Warren. Furthermore, she may eventually need to add support from voters who currently support Biden, and Biden has more support than Sanders, so she could have more to gain than to lose by moving very subtly toward the center.
7. Warren’s lack of endorsements deserves scrutiny. Regardless of her strategy, Warren has received conspicuously few endorsements. She’s currently fourth in FiveThirtyEight’s endorsement tracker, behind Biden, Harris and Cory Booker, and has received only four endorsements from members of Congress outside her home state. She also hasn’t received many endorsements in early states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. Maybe she doesn’t care about endorsements much — but if you believe in “The Party Decides” theory of the race, this is a reasonably big problem for Warren. At the very least, it might mean that party elites are leaving their powder dry and could be open to a candidate who makes a late surge, such as Booker, Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar.
8. Both Sanders and Warren need to expand their appeal to non-white voters, and this is a step in the right direction for Sanders. Ocasio-Cortez is Hispanic (Puerto Rican) and Omar is black (Somali-American). Warren has some nonwhite endorsers herself, such as Raul Grijalva, who is Hispanic, and Deb Haaland, who is Native American. But it’s a pretty white group, as are Warren’s voters. According to YouGov polling for The Economist, Warren has the support of 31 percent of white Democrats, as compared to 15 percent of blacks, 17 percent of Hispanics and 21 percent of voters of “other” nonwhite races.
As for Sanders, his supporters are more diverse than Warren’s in one sense, in that his numbers are fairly even across different racial groups: He has the support of 14 percent of whites, 11 percent of blacks, 19 percent of Hisapnics, and 17 percent of “other” voters, per YouGov. On the other hand, he isn’t actually doing better than Warren with nonwhite voters — she actually has slightly more nonwhite support than he does, according to YouGov (except among Hispanics). Rather, it’s that she’s doing really well with white voters, while his numbers are flagging. In some ways, Warren is starting to replicate the 2016 version of the Sanders coalition, when Sanders won the support of 47 percent of white voters, 26 percent of blacks, and 36 percent of Hispanics, according to the CCES.
To put it another way, Sanders’s support is diverse, but not especially deep, while Warren’s is deep, but not especially diverse. Both of them could stand to gain ground among black, Hispanic and other nonwhite voters, and winning the support of endorsers like Omar and Ocasio-Cortez is good news for Sanders in that regard.
9. Overall, these endorsements could be consistent with a coalition-building approach, which would be a good plan for Sanders. Speaking of expanding one’s coalition: So far, Sanders has not done all that much to expand beyond his current base of support, as I mentioned before. His numbers have been steady in the polls for months, but “steady” isn’t that helpful when you’re polling at only 15 percent — you’ll need more than that to win primaries and caucuses. He’s winning very few voters who didn’t vote for him in 2016, while having lost about two-thirds of the ones who did choose him in 2016 to Warren and other candidates. His team may have miscalculated, thinking that the Sanders base might have been, say, 20 to 25 percent of the electorate rather than 15 percent. It also may have underestimated both Biden and Warren.
But if the critique is that Sanders’s base isn’t broad enough on its own, getting endorsements from the likes of AOC and Omar is at least nodding in the right direction. Sure, it might have been better if they were “against type” endorsers (see point No. 2). But almost any type of endorsement is consistent with a coalition-building strategy, something Sanders has sometimes eschewed in the past even though it’s usually the easiest way to win a party nomination. If Sanders’s campaign uses these endorsements to build momentum toward that strategy — what I sometimes think of as a “kindler, gentler” version of Sanders who is trying to make a broad range of Democratic voters feel at home in his coalition — they could be a turning point in his campaign. If instead they’re a precursor to more left-on-left infighting, probably less so.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/reports-of-the-fullbacks-demise-have-been-greatly-exaggerated/,2019-10-17,,,features,"Oct. 17, 2019",Reports Of The Fullback’s Demise Have Been Greatly Exaggerated,Josh Hermsmeyer,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"There was a time when you couldn’t turn on an NFL game without hearing the announcers opine on fullbacks: goliaths of the gridiron who mowed down defenders. Backs like Bronko Nagurski and Larry Csonka played the position with such grit and ruggedness that they are remembered years after their final, bruising 3-yard runs.
Fullbacks are easy to root for. Their ability to both absorb and mete out punishment sometimes seems superhuman. When Csonka, the Miami Dolphins fullback, was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame in 1987, his longtime head coach Don Shula gave perhaps the greatest and most apt description of a fullback ever uttered: “He was blood and guts. Dirt all over him. He had 12 broken noses.”
But despite enduring in the sport’s collective memory, the style of football that produced these bruisers was very much of a particular time and place. It’s no exaggeration to say that the modern NFL has all but abandoned the position. According to Over The Cap, a website that tracks player contracts, just 14 of the NFL’s 32 teams currently have a fullback signed to a multi-year deal, and the average yearly salary for the position is just $1.16 million. Philadelphia head coach Doug Pederson has admitted that the Eagles don’t invest resources in the position, and the data seems to suggest that much of the league agrees with their approach.
On the field, too, the second back has become an endangered species:

During the 2006 regular season, there were 13,157 total offensive snaps from formations with two running backs.1 By 2018, that number had plummeted to 3,714.
And fullbacks don’t have to look far for a villain to blame: pass-happy offenses. In a league increasingly focused on moving the ball through the air, it turned out that the fullback was the most obvious position to lose importance. Since every NFL offense has to include five linemen, who are ineligible receivers, and a quarterback, there are only so many ways you can mix and match the remaining five eligible players to meet your offensive goals. As NFL teams moved to formations with multiple receivers to support their passing attacks, it was inevitable that some position had to feel the pinch.
Yet, not everyone agrees that fullbacks are obsolete. In fact, some of the NFL’s best teams this season are featuring them. Through Week 6 of the 2019 season, there are six NFL teams who’ve run 100 or more offensive snaps with two backs on the field — and their combined record is an impressive 23-10-1. Even more interesting, the two teams that trot out fullbacks the most — the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers — are the only two undefeated teams left in the league.

2019 totals through Week 6.
*Success rate is the share of plays with positive expected points added.
Source: ESPN Stats & Information Group
Before we get carried away, the Patriots probably can’t credit two-back sets with too much of their success. Their expected points added per play for the package is actually negative, and they’ve gained just 4.5 yards per play with a fullback on the field.
Still, four of the six teams to feature two-back formations extensively are generating positive EPA on those plays, and none more than Kyle Shanahan’s 49ers. The Niners have run plays with a fullback on 139 of 348 offensive snaps through five games in 2019, and they’re gaining about a quarter of a point per play.
Yet what’s surprising about the 49ers and the rest of the teams utilizing a fullback is that their offensive gains aren’t coming from the obvious play type: the run. Having an added blocker in the backfield hasn’t really made running the ball more effective. Instead, the most successful gains from the package have come from the pass plays when a fullback is present.

Even as the two-running-back personnel package has become more rare, passing from it has become increasingly effective. In all but three seasons2 from 2006-18 we can say with a high degree of confidence3 that passing with two backs was better than rushing with two backs, on average. All told, passing with a fullback on the field has been a winner.
The question is: Why?
The dominant narrative around two-running-back sets is that they benefit rushing, not passing. But there are at least a couple of reasonable explanations for passing’s surprising effectiveness, starting with former 49ers head coach Bill Walsh, who extolled the virtues of the fullback in the passing game nearly 40 years ago. He believed the fullback was the “critical part” of the 49ers passing attack because of the matchup difficulties the position presents. (A speedy, athletic fullback can be particularly hard for a middle linebacker to defend in space, but the defense has no choice but to send one out to counter the threat of the run he presents as an added blocker in the backfield.)
And while most teams still run more than they pass with a fullback in the game, there is some evidence that NFL coaches have taken Walsh’s ideas to heart. The gap between the frequency of rush and pass plays called in two-back groupings has narrowed slightly since 2006, and creative play-callers like Shanahan are lining up their top receiving weapons at the fullback with success. The play below from Week 6 shows 49ers tight end George Kittle lined up as the fullback in the offset I-formation. It ends with the Niners gaining 45 yards and setting up a first and goal.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kittle.mp4
Aside from the matchup difficulties a talented fullback presents, deception is another likely explanation for passing success out of two-back personnel. When teams bring out a fullback, the defense is strongly incentivized to stack the box and defend the run, leaving parts of the field vulnerable to attack with the pass. On the pass to Kittle, the play design called for him to sell to the middle linebacker that he was going to lead block. Kittle does a good job fooling No. 51 Troy Reeder, and then he breaks across the field — away from the linebacker — and is wide open for a big gain.
Still, if deception is so effective, why don’t more teams do it? One explanation is the negative perception it appears to have around the league. Recently, former Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis was asked for his thoughts on the decline of the fullback. Lewis lamented that defenses resort to trickery to win, and appeared to long for simpler times when the physicality of the game was paramount.
“The game is about men battling men … that’s what the game was. The game was not tricks. Now we tricky. Now everybody’s smart,” Lewis said.
Teams might prefer to win by lining up and punching the other guy in the mouth, but the data supports Walsh’s view of the world. Given the precedent set by Walsh in San Francisco, there’s a certain symmetry to Shanahan and the Niners leading a mini fullback-resurgence, but it’s not just vapid nostalgia. When you combine a consistent matchup advantage with deception, you probably have a recipe for success in the NFL. As a potent passing weapon, perhaps the fullback is back to stay.

We posed this question to Democratic primary voters in a poll conducted using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, before and after Tuesday’s debate. It turns out that the race looks somewhat different depending on which category you fall into.
Though former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders are the three favorite candidates among both types of voters, the share of respondents considering each candidate differs substantially depending on whether the respondent prefers someone who can beat Trump or someone whose issue positions are similar to their own.
Among the voters who said beating Trump was more important — around two-thirds of overall respondents — Biden is the clear top choice. Before the debate, 62 percent of voters said they were considering voting for him. These types of voters also liked Warren, with 53 percent of voters saying they were considering her. Thirty-three percent were also considering Sanders, putting him in a distant third place.
But among the remaining one-third of voters who prioritize candidates with similar issue positions, Sanders actually entered the debate with the highest share considering him — almost 47 percent. He was followed closely by Warren at 43 percent, then Biden at 39 percent.

From a survey of 3,360 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed between Oct. 7 and Oct. 14. The same people were surveyed again from Oct. 15 to Oct. 16; 1,761 responded to the second wave.
There wasn’t much movement post-debate among the top three. Biden and Warren each gained a few percentage points among respondents who prioritized beating Trump. Warren picked up some support among voters who prefer a candidate with similar positions — enough that, after the debate, she essentially ties Sanders among those voters.
Outside of the top tier, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, saw the largest jump, gaining more than 5 percentage points among voters who prioritize beating Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar also made modest gains among those voters, as well as smaller gains among voters who prioritize issues. But overall, the debate didn’t really change the fundamental divide between how voters see the primary — and while a candidate’s policy platform is important, whether voters think he or she can beat Trump still might be the most important factor of all.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

From Michael Branicky, a challenge of currency conversion:
Riddler Nation has two coins: the Dio, worth $538, and the Phantus, worth $19. When visiting on vacation, Riddler National Bank will gladly convert your dollars into Dios and Phanti. For example, if you were to give a bank teller $614, they’d return to you one Dio and four Phanti, since 614 = 1 × 538 + 4 × 19. But if you tried to exchange one dollar more (i.e., $615), then alas, there is no combination of Dios and Phanti the teller could give you, and you won’t get your money’s worth in local currency.
To make the bank teller’s job (and your vacation) as miserable as possible, you decide to bring the largest dollar amount that cannot be converted into Riddler currency. How much money are we talking here? That is, what’s the largest whole number that cannot be expressed as a sum of 19s and 538s?

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏Brennan Carmody 👏 of Atlanta, Georgia, winner of last week’s Riddler Express.
Last week, there was an auditorium with 200 seats, numbered from 1 to 200 and filled to capacity. A speaker overlooking the audience said: “I’m thinking of a rather large whole number. Every seat number in this auditorium evenly divides my number, except for two of them — and those two seats happen to be next to each other.” Which two numbers was the speaker referring to?
Solver Jenny Mitchell made a key realization: Since every seat number, other than the two excluded numbers, had to evenly divide the large mystery number, those two excluded numbers both had to be the largest powers of primes smaller than the total number of seats (which was 200). And because the two seats were consecutive, that meant that one of them had to be even, and therefore a power of 2. The largest power of 2 that’s smaller than 200 is 27, or 128. That must be one of the two seat numbers.
Since the two seats had to be consecutive, you next had to look on either side of 128. Is 129 the largest power of a prime number less than 200? No, since 129 equals 3×43. What about 127? The number 127 is itself prime and can be written as 1271 — so yes, it’s the largest power of a prime less than 200! The two seat numbers were indeed 127 and 128.
Several solvers extended the original problem over Twitter, wondering what happens when we change the size of the auditorium. Interestingly, some auditorium sizes, like 100, have no solution, while a small handful of auditorium sizes, like 13, have two possible solutions — seats 7 and 8, and seats 8 and 9.
And what’s the largest auditorium for which we can (currently) find a solution? That would be one with 282,589,934−3 seats, where the two seat numbers that don’t evenly divide the large number on the speaker’s mind would be 282,589,933 and 282,589,933−1, the largest known Mersenne prime as of this writing. If the auditorium had this many seats, I wonder what number the speaker would have to think of so that only two seats didn’t evenly divide that number … it would have to be really, catastrophically large and … ugh, my brain hurts!

Last week, you were asked to navigate your boat around two enemy submarines and safely to a harbor. The subs started out evenly spaced between your boat and the harbor, but you had no further information about their subsequent movement. The subs had to be directly underneath your ship to sink it, and they could track your moves with precision and respond efficiently. How much faster than the sub did your ship have to be to guarantee you could safely avoid them?
As explored in a previous Riddler, if there were just one sub, your ship needed to be about 2.33 times faster than it. The animation below illustrates your ship’s journey, which can be broken down into two parts. First comes a straight line segment that continues until the sub’s expanding radius catches up to you. Then, you wrap around the circumference of the expanding circle until you reach the harbor.
But with two subs, you had to be even faster. This is because the leftmost sub now started closer to the harbor, meaning it’ll reach the harbor in less time — and once a sub reaches the harbor, there’s no way for you to get there safely.
To solve the riddle with two subs, let’s first only consider that leftmost sub. (We’ll come back to the other sub in a minute.) To avoid it, you can employ the same strategy as before: Travel in a line, and then curve around the expanding circumference. David worked out the exact speed with some advanced calculus, finding that you have to be 3.396 times faster than that sub to reach safety. Other solvers turned to their computers, finding a similar result via numerical computation.
But what about that second sub? It turns out the second sub doesn’t affect the answer! Because the subs were evenly spaced at the beginning, the points of tangency — the times when your ship brushed against the sub’s expanding circles — formed similar triangles, guaranteeing that the straight line path that avoided the final sub would narrowly avoid the other sub along the way. So the answer was indeed that your ship had to be 3.396 times faster than the subs.
But what if, instead of two subs, there were N subs evenly spaced between you and the harbor? Just like the case of two subs, it turns out you only have to worry about avoiding the last sub — doing so will guarantee you avoid the other N−1 subs. For example, here’s the optimal trajectory when N equals five:
David went even further, finding an expression for the relative speed v your boat must have to avoid N subs:

Here’s a graph showing the required speed (relative to the subs) you’d need to escape from anywhere from one to 10 subs:
Finally, David considered what happens when N gets really big — that is, when there are many, many subs. In this case, you’d have to sail very quickly, almost a straight line toward the harbor, finally curving around roughly a quarter of the last growing circle. So as N gets very large, you’re traveling a distance that’s approximately N + 𝜋/2 times longer than the distance between adjacent subs, meaning that’s how many times faster than each sub you’d have to be.
In other words, we’re gonna need a faster boat.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-plenty-of-anti-trump-republicans-you-just-have-to-know-where-to-look/,2019-10-16,,,features,"Oct. 14, 2019",There Are Plenty Of Anti-Trump Republicans. You Just Have To Know Where To Look.,Perry Bacon Jr.,FiveThirtyEight,The Trump Administration,"Americans opposed to President Trump are constantly asking some version of this question: “Why won’t Republicans break with Trump?”
The personalities on Fox News are largely standing with the president amid the controversy over the Trump administration pushing Ukrainian officials to investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son. So are Republicans in Congress. Vice President Mike Pence and others inside the Trump administration are also defending the president’s actions involving Ukraine (a shift from when one-time Trump advisers like Dan Coats would sometimes signal disagreement with the president’s stances).
But looking at Trump’s standing only among people currently inside of powerful Republican-controlled spaces — the party itself, Fox News, the White House, etc. — presents an incomplete picture and understates opposition to Trump among Republican politicians and activists. Almost by definition, that opposition can’t happen within the obvious GOP spaces — the president and his acolytes have accumulated enough power that it’s increasingly hard to be both be anti-Trump and a Republican in good standing at a major conservative institution.
So Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan left the GOP and became an independent. Former Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina lost in a primary last year to an opponent endorsed by Trump after speaking out against the president. And just last Friday, Fox News anchor and occasional Trump critic Sheppard Smith resigned,1 as did Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who had occasionally clashed with the president.
Indeed, widen your lens and you can find all kinds of anti-Trump sentiment in conservative and right-leaning circles. This anti-Trump bloc, in addition to Republicans still supporting the president, might have lots of sway as impeachment unfolds — if they can reach GOP voters.
The media
You could create your very own conservative, anti-Trump TV network if you hired all the Trump-skeptical Republicans who regularly appear as talking heads on CNN and MSNBC. CNN, for example, has Amanda Carpenter, Charlie Dent, John Kasich, and Mia Love. MSNBC boasts Carlos Curbelo, Susan Del Percio, Elise Jordan, Mike Murphy, Jennifer Rubin, Joe Scarborough, Michael Steele, Charlie Sykes, Nicole Wallace, George Will and Rick Tyler.2
Yes, most conservative pundits on Fox News are heartily pro-Trump, but not all conservative pundits are on Fox News.
Elected officials
There were 241 Republicans in the U.S. House in early 2017, at the start of Trump’s tenure. Since then, more than a quarter have either been defeated at the ballot box, in last November’s elections (29), or retired (36).3 Some of them, such as former Rep. Mia Love of Utah, blame Trump’s unpopularity for their defeats. Others, such as Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, hint that they are leaving Congress in part because they are uncomfortable with the direction Trump is taking the GOP, as the Washington Post recently reported in a story detailing the exodus of House Republicans.
There is also a group of Trump-skeptical governors and senators — most notably former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and former Gov. John Kasich of Ohio — who left their posts after 2018. And then you have figures like former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois , ex-Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts and Sanford, all of whom are running long-shot primary challenges to Trump. Former Rep. Bob Inglis of South Carolina, who has publicly come out against Trump, is suing his state’s Republican Party in an effort to overturn its decision to cancel next year’s Republican primary, a move designed in part to boost the president.
So, in addition to that conservative, anti-Trump cable channel, you could also piece together a Senate majority (51 people) from Republicans who have previously served in either the House or the Senate but who have been publicly wary of Trump.
Senior Republican staffers
OK, if you’re going to have a shadow, anti-Trump GOP Senate, you need some experienced Republican operatives to staff it. You won’t have to look too hard.
In a clear and public rebuke to Trump, chiefs of staff for Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush recently told the New York Times that the presidents they served would never have asked for help winning an election from a foreign government. A group of conservative lawyers, many of whom served in top positions in the Department of Justice under Reagan or one of the Bushes, are supporting the impeachment inquiry.
Moreover, plenty of people who served in senior roles in the Trump administration itself, including H.R. McMaster (national security adviser), Anthony Scaramucci (communications director) and Rex Tillerson (secretary of state) have distanced themselves from the president.
Again, the Republican staffers currently in the White House are defending the president, but that might mask some broader disagreement among senior-level Republican staffers.
Conservative institutions
Many organizations on the right, such as the Heritage Foundation, are in lockstep with the president. But others — the Cato Institute, the Niskanen Center — are fairly critical of him
Or, take the white evangelical conservative movement as a whole. It is often portrayed as totally behind the president, and news stories often cite people like Jerry Falwell Jr. who are closely allied with the president to show that. But white evangelicals aren’t completely aligned with Trump — a generational gap has begun to open up. And really, people like Falwell, who runs a Christian college (Liberty University), are more accurately described as evangelical leaders who support Trump, rather than evangelical leaders. overall. J.D. Greear, head of the Southern Baptist Convention, is more clearly a “leader” of America’s evangelicals — and he is kind of lukewarm about Trump.
So it’s important to understand that many conservative organizations and power centers on the right are strongly behind Trump, but also that increasingly “conservative” has come to mean “pro-Trump,” a narrative that writes out of the story organizations and people who had what were considered fairly rightly-leaning views pre-Trump.


OK, I admit this is an imprecise exercise. What overall percentage of elite Republicans — conservative media figures, current and former members of Congress, current and former administration officials, etc. — oppose Trump? That’s basically impossible to quantify.
But I think it’s higher than often portrayed — because some opposition lives in non-GOP spaces where people aren’t looking, and because much of it is also hidden from view, as elected Republicans face strong incentives to stand by Trump publicly.
All of this helps explain why Republican voters are among the most loyal-to-Trump constituencies in the Republican Party. Surveys have long suggested that between 85 and 90 percent of Republican voters approve of the president. Only about 13 percent of people who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 said that they disapproved of Trump in a poll conducted in late 2018 and early 2019 by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group. According to FiveThirtyEight’s average of impeachment polls, about 14 percent of Republicans support impeachment.
I wrote recently about how rank-and-file voters often follow cues from elites, noting that impeachment support increased among Democrats after the party unified around the idea. So maybe if we had full data on the views of all Republican elites, we’d find that about 10 to 15 percent oppose Trump, perfectly in line with voters.
But I think that the safer assumption is this: Trump has in many ways successfully purged his critics from the power centers of the GOP. So a potential resistance to him among Republican elites doesn’t just face the obvious challenge that he’s the president and popular among GOP voters. Republican elites who are wary of Trump are also not well situated to make their case to rank-and-file Republican voters. They are working in lobbying shops or boardrooms instead of on Capitol Hill, speaking to audiences on CNN and MSNBC instead of Fox News, and outside of the administration instead of inside it.
The facts of the Ukraine case, or its politics, could open more doors for those anti-Trump voices in those pro-Trump spaces. That would likely have profound effects on the views of GOP voters.
For now, though, the Trump-skeptical bloc in Congress remains a small part of the overall Trump-skeptical conservative coalition.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sure-its-the-preseason-but-zion-williamsons-rookie-numbers-are-historic/,2019-10-16,,,features,"Oct. 15, 2019",Zion Williamson’s Rookie Numbers Are Historic,Chris Herring,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"Back in the spring, after he averaged 26 points per game during the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, it would have been hard to believe that the hype around Zion Williamson could reach new heights.
But now, a week from opening night of the NBA season, there’s perhaps more confidence than ever that Williamson will become a star. That’s thanks to some gaudy preseason numbers: The No. 1 overall pick is averaging better than 23 points, six rebounds and two assists per game in just 27 minutes a night through four preseason games. He’s shot a ridiculous 71 percent from the field, all while the Pelicans have gone 4-0.
All of which raises a few obvious questions: First, is there any way Zion, as a rookie, can keep this up once the games actually count? And what challenges will NBA defenses throw at him?
Before we get into just how likely it is that Williamson maintains this level of play, it seems worth establishing just how dominant he’s been thus far. As of Tuesday morning, there were only three players averaging more points per game this preseason than Zion’s 23.3,1 and all three of them — Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden and Stephen Curry — have previously won MVP. Williamson put on show last week in Chicago, scoring 29 points on 12-of-13 shooting — the most points an NBA player has had in an exhibition game on 90 percent shooting or better in the past 20 years. The Bulls couldn’t do a thing to keep him out of the paint, as he scored nine of those 12 baskets from 1 foot or closer and made two others from 2 feet away. (His longest made shot was from 5 feet away.) His shot chart from that night was both comical and a thing of beauty:

— Will Guillory (@WillGuillory) October 10, 2019

The highlights themselves aren’t bad, either:

Williamson’s preseason success puts him in uncharted territory. Over the past 20 years, no rookie has finished their preseason campaign averaging more than 20 points per game. Steve Francis, who finished with 19.6 points a night back in 1999, was the closest. And in terms of true shooting percentage, barely anyone with his scoring output has come close to touching Zion’s level of efficiency, at 73.7 percent thus far. (Jimmer Fredette, at 70.2 percent in 2011, and DeAndre Ayton, at 65.1 percent last year, are the only ones2 in the same ballpark over the past two decades.)
While it may seem unlikely that Williamson will continue this level of production during the regular season, it’s worth noting that, collectively, high-scoring rookies don’t see huge decreases in their point totals and efficiency metrics when the real games start. According to ESPN Stats & Information Group, the 27 rookies who’ve averaged 15 points per game or more in their first preseason since 1999 have seen scoring and true shooting percentage declines of just 1.1 points and 2.4 percentage points, respectively, from the preseason to the regular season.
And it’s worth noting that six of the players from that group — Kevin Durant, Tyreke Evans, John Wall, Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell and Trae Young — actually increased both their scoring average and their true-shooting percentage from the preseason to the regular season.
We haven’t seen anyone, not even LeBron James, have their way as a rookie this quickly. Sure, we can attribute some of Williamson’s adjustment to his level of competition in the preseason, when defenses aren’t sharp. And perhaps it’s reasonable to think that no one wants to step in front of the runaway train that is Williamson just yet, especially in a game that ultimately doesn’t matter.
Still, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry has used Williamson within the offense effectively, having him catch the ball on the move to make use of his athleticism. And by having him curl to the free throw line to take feeds from JJ Redick, it puts the defense in a bit of a bind, as defenders will either have to risk guarding a downhill Zion with a single player or have someone come down and help, which would leave one of the league’s best shooters open from the perimeter. (It will also be worth watching the progression of Lonzo Ball’s jumper, which could open things up more.)
Teams will undoubtedly work to make things more difficult for Williamson, starting a week from now. One clear way to do that: Avoid committing turnovers, as Williamson gets to show off his otherworldly athleticism in transition, which becomes more likely following a miscue. And when you inevitably turn it over at some point, be sure to get back in transition and force New Orleans to actually run its offense, as opposed to letting the up-tempo club run wild. (The Pelicans were second in pace last season.)
And it goes without saying that defenses, when possible, will pack the paint the best they can to discourage him from going to the basket. We even saw him get the best of Rudy Gobert, the two-time reigning Defensive Player of the Year, showing that 1-on-1 matchups — even against elite stoppers and rim protectors — won’t always be enough to deter him.
His shot profile alone, with a whopping 34 of his 35 preseason makes coming from the paint, suggests that teams are going to dare him to shoot from the outside. (In this regard, perhaps the most comparable rookie in recent memory would be Blake Griffin, who scored 79 percent of his preseason points as a rookie from inside the paint back in 2010, per ESPN Stats & Info.) Teams would prefer to give up an occasional 3-pointer as opposed to surrendering a high-percentage layup.
This strategy can work — particularly in the playoffs when things grind to a halt — but there are a couple of challenges it presents for defenses. First, sitting too far back in the paint may provide Zion with enough space to get a running start, and we’ve already seen he’s athletic enough to jump over almost anyone who stands in his way. Secondly, Williamson is very good at moving without the ball and burrowing into open spots on the court. So if teams play far off him, he’ll likely still find ways to get involved, either as an on-ball screener who then rolls to the basket, or as an off-ball cutter who does damage that way.
However it all plays out, at least we’ll finally get the chance to see how Williamson stacks up and whether he really turns out to be the franchise-changing player so many think he’s capable of becoming. But from the numbers he’s put up thus far this preseason, it seems like we shouldn’t be surprised if that indeed turns out to be the case.

Opening night of the official NBA season is still a week away, but Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson is already putting up historic numbers with his preseason performance so far. He’s averaging more than 23 points, six rebounds, and two assists per game in 27 minutes a night over four games. FiveThirtyEight’s Chris Herring points out that “over the past 20 years, no rookie has finished their preseason campaign averaging more than 20 points per game.” The only other players in the league averaging more points per game this preseason are Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden and Stephen Curry, and all three are previous MVP winners.

75 petabytes
On Tuesday, Amazon announced it had moved its database storage from a competitor, Oracle, to its own AWS services, a migration effort that involved more than 100 consumer services, and “75 petabytes of internal data stored in nearly 7,500 Oracle databases,” the company wrote in its blog post. The move included customer-facing tools like Alexa, Amazon Prime and Twitch, as well as internal ones like AdTech. [TechCrunch]
4-day-old baby girl
A couple in the middle of burying their own child at a cemetery in Northern India were surprised to hear crying noises nearby. They were the sounds of a four-day-old baby girl in an earthen pot. After digging up two to three feet of dirt, the three-pound infant was rescued in the state of Uttar Pradesh and brought to the hospital by a security guard. The child is receiving medical treatment in an intensive care unit for infections and respiratory issues while an investigation has been launched to locate her parents. [CNN]

Single women and lesbians in France are a step closer to accessing fertility treatments after the country’s lower house of parliament approved a new bioethics bill on Tuesday. The new law would fulfill a pledge President Emmanuel Macron made during his 2017 election campaign. National Assembly lawmakers voted 359 to 114, with 72 abstentions. The bill will now go to the Senate in January. [AFP/Straits Times]
13.7 percent decline
International students aren’t as interested in coming to the U.S. for business school as they once were. Experts say changes in U.S. immigration policy, trade and political tensions with China and the growing popularity of technology jobs that don’t require M.B.A. degrees are why international applications fell by 13.7 percent this year. Harvard Business School saw its largest overall drop in applications to its M.B.A. programs since 2005 at 6.7 percent, and the declines were even greater at Northwestern, Yale and Dartmouth, at more than 15 percent.

17 black female United Airlines pilots
The most recent data from the Federal Aviation Industry shows an extraordinary gender gap persists in who is flying airplanes, with women making up only 7 percent of American pilots. Only a tiny slice of them are black women. Captain Theresa Claiborne, the first African-American pilot in the U.S. Air Force, says at United, where she works, only 900 of the almost 13,000 pilots are women, and only 17 are black women. “Right now we only have two black women captains.” [Bloomberg]

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): So for starters, what did you go into the fourth debate expecting? Same ol’ same ol’? (After all, the last debate didn’t shake up the race too much). My hunch was that much of the discussion would center around impeachment as that has been the news story of the last two weeks. And sure enough it was the first question of the night — but was it the question?
Arguably not, right? So, top level — what stood out to you the most in Tuesday night’s debate?
julia_azari (Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): For me the takeaways were that the gap between the top three and the rest of the field isn’t as big as you might expect, and also that it’s hard to have a serious contest about principles when most of the people on the stage share basic principles.
Questions on impeachment could have been used to symbolically differentiate candidates, but the questions weren’t very conducive to that.
sarahf: That’s such a good point, Julia. It just seems really hard for candidates to talk for three hours about issues where I think there’s a large level of agreement – like supporting an impeachment inquiry into President Trump or introducing stricter gun laws. And it just seems to fall flat to me. I’m not sure what folks watching at home really learn from these exchanges either.
geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, elections analyst):  My main takeaway was that there were arguably more sharp exchanges in this debate. Biden-Warren, Buttigieg-O’Rourke, Warren-Klobuchar, Gabbard-Buttigieg. Sanders was sometimes with Warren during those back and forths, too, particularly on health care.
seth.masket (Seth Masket, political science professor at the University of Denver and FiveThirtyEight contributor): This definitely seemed both one of the most substantive debates and the one with the sharpest arguments and distinctions between the candidates, like Geoff said. We also saw something of a coherent ideological divide emerging, with Biden, Klobuchar, and Buttigieg playing the role of moderates needling the more progressive candidates about whether their policies were realistic and whether they’re hurting Democratic goals.
sarahf: I’d noticed that, too, Seth — it reminded me of John Delaney in the second debate when he and the other moderates teamed up on Warren and Sanders; except this time I thought the punches landed more effectively?
What did y’all think?
julia_azari: I did think the punches landed more effectively. Which goes to what I said in our pre-debate chat on Tuesday: Debates highlight the inevitable flaws of otherwise strong candidates. It really struck me that the more moderate cluster of candidates focused on implementation and feasibility, not on ideological defenses of moderate policy. There was some, of course. But this sort of anti-ideological pragmatic impulse kept surfacing.
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, the health care segment was so interesting because it exposed some major differences, and instead of John Delaney attacking Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, it was Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. And Joe Biden, too.
sarahf: I thought Sanders did particularly well on the health care debate and was definitely the most transparent about what his plan for Medicare for All would entail. He acknowledged that “taxes will go up” and argued that they’d go up most for the wealthy. But he didn’t shy away from the idea that they would go up for everyone, even if his argument is that it’s less than “what they were paying for premiums and out of pocket expenses.”
seth.masket: I’d agree with the moderate candidates being more effective, Sarah. Their critiques of the more progressive candidates were more substantive this time. Although I was surprised at Klobuchar’s and Buttigieg’s claim that we’re really, really close to an assault weapons ban if only O’Rourke doesn’t screw it up with his reckless talk. This didn’t strike me as a realistic description of the current political situation.
sarahf: So Julia, at the outset you’d mentioned the gap between the top three candidates and the rest of the field not seeming that large … tell us more about that?
julia_azari: OK, so in general the conventional wisdom since the last debate has been that the field is Warren, Biden, Sanders. That certainly seems to be true in the polls. But there are a lot of other candidates who keep showing up on the debate stage. And I’d argue someone like Amy Klobuchar finally had her breakthrough. The others — Booker, Harris, O’Rourke, etc. don’t seem to be going anywhere but they also don’t… seem to be going anywhere.
They’re all there in case a front-runner plummets. And the front-runners all seem to have enough liabilities that at this point that seems possible. For example, Warren still isn’t very strong with non-white voters. Biden has the accusations of inappropriate behavior, and he is off-putting to progressives. Sanders’s base has shrunk and he’s also had a serious health setback.
sarahf: It sounds as if Klobuchar was your stand out candidate, Julia. What about you, Seth and Geoffrey? Who do you think performed particularly well last night?
seth.masket: I agree with Julia’s assessment that there’s room for the lower-tier candidates to make gains if one of the front-runners stumbles, but I also didn’t see anything that would really change the lineup much. Warren took a lot of fire but handled it pretty well and actually got in some very strong moments. Biden stumbled at times, but no worse than in previous debates. And Sanders actually seemed better than he’s been in previous debates, which is no small feat given recent events. He was sharp on policy and even occasionally funny.
That said, Klobuchar also had an unusually good night. Probably the strongest case for moderation out there tonight (even if we’re not sure what that is).
geoffrey.skelley: You know, I also thought Klobuchar did well. There were some people in our live chat who seemed baffled at that — ahem, managing editor Micah Cohen! But I thought she made some strong critiques of the Sanders/Warren health care approach, and her response where she spoke about her grandfather and how a union protected him felt like a meaningful moment.
julia_azari: I am genuinely curious how Buttigieg’s performance will be received.
seth.masket: I’ve been wondering about that.
julia_azari: He was really forceful… and argumentative with the rest of the field, especially O’Rourke who frankly strikes me as a strange target.
geoffrey.skelley: I also thought Buttigieg was strong, but we’ve seen harm come to other candidates’ favorability numbers when they’ve gone on the attack. Is Buttigieg different?
julia_azari: I’m not sure if everyone caught that he is from the Industrial Midwest?
seth.masket: Buttigieg knows he can’t get anywhere without pulling some folks down, but going negative seems almost out of character for him at this point.
julia_azari: It was strange from the person who scolded people in the last debate about how this is why everyone hates Washington.
sarahf: Clare mentioned this on the live blog, but I do think Buttigieg going after someone like O’Rourke instead of Biden does make a difference, and while he was tough on Warren, I think he was definitely more respectful. I guess I just think of his debate performances so far, this one was definitely his strongest.
geoffrey.skelley: Well, if the question is respect, he may come off better than Biden, whose tête-à-tête with Warren was not great on that front.
julia_azari: If academic-women Twitter is any indication, peoplethey were not into that Biden-Warren moment in which he responded to her work with the CFPB by saying that he got her votes to pass it into law.
sarahf: Yeah … so that Biden-Warren moment. What do you make of their exchange? Is this something we’re going to see replayed and that could hurt, say, Biden’s favorability? It definitely came across as a paternalistic moment, but I wonder if it will actually impact those who already support Biden., because aAs Julia mentioned in our pre-debate chat on Tuesday, and Perry on the live blog, — part of what we’ve learned through these debates is where in the party these candidates fall, and what that means as the party sorts out stances on race and gender.
geoffrey.skelley: Biden naturally has claimed most of Obama’s accomplishments as his own. As the No. 2 in that administration, that’s a smart move for him! But Warren’s response when Biden tried to claim a role in the creation of the CFPB was… awkward. She specifically thanked Obama. And then Biden said, “You did a hell of a job in your job.”
julia_azari: The Biden response to Warren’s point buries the point she was trying to make, which is to respond to all the pragmatism and implementation critiques throughout the night. She was trying to argue “dream big, fight hard” — and make the case for how and why that works.
seth.masket: And as with the previous debates, Biden emerged as That Guy who doesn’t seem to realize that he’s saying offensive and hurtful things. But Warren had some strong and understated ripostes (as Geoffrey noted). I’m not sure how much this reputation has actually hurt his standing so far, but it’s making it harder for him to grow his support beyond what he already has.
sarahf: Which… considering this was the fourth primary debate, how does it fit in with the debates we’ve seen already? I know we chatted about how maybe debates don’t matter all that much for the horse-race on Tuesday, and how it’s more about understanding the direction the party is moving in — but do you think that was the case tonight? Or do you think we’ll see some horse race movement?
seth.masket: Twelve people seemed like too many, but CNN largely handled that by ignoring about a third of the stage most of the time.

geoffrey.skelley: I think it’s possible there’ll be some movement in the polls. I can’t imagine there will be an earthquake or anything, but this debate felt more dynamic to me than the previous one-night debate, which of course saw little change in the polls afterward — except Warren’s continued rise.
julia_azari: I think it made differentiation a highly sought-after commodity, which also means that candidates were more negative, as we’ve mentioned.
geoffrey.skelley: Yes, and isn’t that the way that someone like Buttigieg or Warren stands out? I was tasked with watching Harris and Booker during the debate, and the problem for Booker especially was that he was so non-combative and didn’t spend any time seeking that differentiation. He’s a great orator, but I just don’t see anything he said actually moving the polls.
julia_azari: They all also tried to tell personal stories, but with 12 people that somehow comes off as really inauthentic. Everyone knows a person with a horrible illness and a struggling family and has a surprising friend!
seth.masket: The less popular candidates really didn’t offer much to suggest why they should be in the middle or top tier either. Gabbard still seems very out of step with the rest of the field (and the party, largely). Steyer criticized billionaires who buy access but sure sounded like a billionaire who had bought access.
Sadly, a lot of debates end with questions like, “Say something nice about someone you hate.” I don’t know what we learn from those.
geoffrey.skelley: Well, is this where I echo Maggie Koerth-Baker from the live blog and mention there wasn’t a single question about climate change? But a question about Ellen DeGeneres sitting next to George W. Bush at a football game? OK, well, that was dumb.
sarahf: Yeah, that does seem to be a recurring theme in these debates. At least one cringe-worthy question from the moderators that’s too kumbaya-ish.
geoffrey.skelley: Much 🙄
seth.masket: You didn’t like, “You’re feeble and old; tell us why you aren’t feeble and old”?
sarahf: But setting the last question of the evening aside, was there anything new that you learned or surprised you in this debate? Or was it more about different candidates surprising you?
geoffrey.skelley: The combative stance taken by Buttigieg was surprising in that it was a theme for him. He had just released an ad attacking Sanders and Warren by name over their Medicare for All plan, so it wasn’t a shock that he went after them, but then to sort of make that his story throughout the night was somewhat surprising.
Then again, maybe it made sense for him to do that. He might feel that his support is more concrete now than it was before, so why not take some shots?
sarahf: That’s kind of my thought in all this, Geoff. And as you found — Buttigieg has also been consistently performing well in Iowa and New Hampshire polls, so I think he treated tonight as a gambit.
seth.masket: Right before the debate, David Axelrod made the good point that the takeaway moments from debates tend to be planned out in advance — candidates just look for opportunities to deploy them. So it’s interesting to see the choices candidates made along those lines. I’m not sure why Harris used her big moment to complain about Trump’s use of Twitter, or why Biden thought minimizing Warren’s work on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) would be a good idea.
geoffrey.skelley: Harris’s attempt to attack Warren over the president’s Twitter account was my pick for weird moment of the night.
julia_azari: I agree with Geoff that Harris’s prosecutorial moment about Trump’s Twitter was weird, in that she not only mentioned it several times, but also asked Warren if she would pledge to ask Twitter to remove Trump from the platform.
sarahf: Let’s now cast forward to the next debate in November. Eight candidates have already qualified, but four candidates up there last night still haven’t — Gabbard, Castro, O’Rourke and Klobuchar. Do we think this debate helped these candidates get closer to qualifying for November?
It sounds as if we might think it may have helped Klobuchar the most? It’s also kind of crazy when you think about it — eight candidates have already qualified!!!
geoffrey.skelley: It’s interesting because the DNC barely raised the donor threshold — it was 130,000 for this debate, and now it’s 165,000 for the next one. But going from four qualifying polls of 2 percent to now four polls of 3 percent is actually a bit of a barrier. Most candidates have had an easier time with donors than polls.
There’s the early-state poll route, too, but no one’s strength is quite so disproportionately concentrated in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina that anyone’s getting two polls of 5 percent while not also getting four polls of 3 percent or more.
seth.masket: My impression is that Klobuchar would have the best shot of the ones Sarah mentioned. I think there’s interest in someone like her — just maybe a lot of potential donors and supporters who weren’t sure she’d have a shot at winning this thing. My impression was that she allayed some of those concerns tonight.
sarahf: So maybe that’s a good argument for Julia’s point about the gap between the top tier candidates and the lower tier candidates not being that large. I just feel like I’ve been burned by this line of thinking before — particularly after the last debate, where our poll with Ipsos (and others) found not much had changed other than Warren continued to rise in the polls.
seth.masket: FWIW, some of the early-state activists I’ve been interviewing have been donating to multiple candidates, largely to reward them (in small amounts) for stances they’ve taken or speeches they’ve made.
julia_azari: Yeah. I’m not blaming the DNC entirely for not having figured out how this would work. The rules around presidential nominations seem to be changing.
geoffrey.skelley: I am very skeptical that Gabbard or Castro will get many 3 percent polls — they’ve barely had any at 2 percent in the window for the next debate, and neither has any qualifying polls. Klobuchar and O’Rourke, on the other hand, have had a lot of 2 percent polls, so just a little increase in support could get them there. Each has one qualifying poll so far, so they need three more of at least 3 percent.
sarahf: So where do we think we go from here? Who were the debate’s winners and losers? We don’t really do much of that here at FiveThirtyEight, we let the polls have the final say, but were there any clear narratives you saw emerge tonight in terms of debate performance? And how will that impact things moving forward?
julia_azari: I think the winners were Klobuchar, Warren, and Ellen.
seth.masket: John McCain has won a surprising number of these debates so far.
julia_azari: Losers? No clear losers, but no needed breakout moments from Castro, Yang, O’Rourke either.
geoffrey.skelley: I’d put Castro, Steyer, Gabbard as potential losers. Castro and Steyer because they just didn’t have much time. And Gabbard because she said that she supports a third-term abortion ban — though with health exceptions for the mother — just isn’t good politics in a Democratic debate.
seth.masket: I think tonight was a big test for Warren, given her possible front-runner status, and she handled it well. So that’s a win. And yes, Klobuchar was given more time than usual and made the most of it.
geoffrey.skelley: I guess Harris might be a loser, too, in that I don’t see where she did much to break through again.
julia_azari: I agree with that.
geoffrey.skelley: And Booker — he isn’t breaking through either. Hell, almost all of them are actually losers. Hot take.
seth.masket: We’re getting to the point where treading water isn’t enough.
sarahf: Yeah, and given what we know about Harris and how some of her support has gone to Warren, where do we think support for some of these candidates we’re mentioning as winners, like Buttigieg, Klobuchar or Sanders — let’s not forget his late-night endorsement from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — comes from? Because based on what Seth just said I could see what happened in the third debate happen here, too — Warren continues to rise and no one else really sees anything happen.
geoffrey.skelley: Obviously, there was some strategic timing for the incoming endorsements from AOC for Sanders. The endorsement had to have been known for a bit and they were waiting for the right moment to reveal it. Those endorsements after a solid debate performance in the aftermath of a health scare might be a good way to shift the conversation in a positive direction for Sanders.
seth.masket: There are still a lot of uncommitted voters out there, and committed ones who say they could change their mind.
I’m wondering if AOC brings Sanders any support he didn’t already have, though.
geoffrey.skelley: Maybe the AOC endorsement helps Sanders some with more liberal voters? Warren has been crushing him there in recent polls from Quinnipiac. In Quinnipiac’s pre-debate poll, Warren got 50 percent among that group while Sanders only got 14 percent.
julia_azari: I’ll also be watching to see the dual dynamic of which faction (left and center-left) will win, and which person has demonstrated their ability to knock out the others for who can be the standard-bearer for their faction.
Another takeaway from the debate: it feels very late in the season for political junkies and professional bloggers, but for a lot of people it’s quite early still.
sarahf: Always true, Julia.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-49ers-are-the-best-in-footballs-most-important-stat/,2019-10-16,,,features,"Oct. 16, 2019",The 49ers Are The Best In Football’s Most Important Stat,Michael Salfino,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"For decades, the battle to win football games has pivoted on the battle to win the passing game. The connection between winning and net passing yards per pass play — that is, outgaining your opponent on passing yards minus sack yards lost per pass play — has been well known in football circles since the 1960s, when it was introduced to the world by the late Bud Goode, a TV executive with a passion for math and statistics who shared his work with a number of teams and coaches. The statistic, along with turnover differential, is one of the most predictive of success in football.
By net passing yards per pass play alone, the San Francisco 49ers, not the New England Patriots, are the best team in football. After their 20-7 demolition of Jared Goff and the Rams on Sunday in Los Angeles, their performance, according to the metric, is at a level of excellence rarely seen in the NFL over a full season.
Behind Jimmy Garoppolo’s passing and a stout defense, the 49ers are 3.1 yards per pass play in the black, well ahead of the second-place Patriots and more than twice as dominant as 27 other teams. They held the Rams and Goff to 48 net passing yards on 28 pass plays, or 1.7 yards per pass play, while gaining 6.6 yards, for a difference of 4.9. The 49ers, by the way, lost the turnover battle 2-to-1.

Teams with a positive differential of at least 2.0 are 22-7 this season. Even the two teams with a positive differential between 1.0 and 2.0 have been successful: Buffalo and Seattle are a combined 9-2 through Week 6. The teams with a negative differential of 1.0 or worse, on the other hand, are a combined 12-31-1.
To get a sense of how rare the Niners’ feat is, only one team has approached their current mark for a full season since at least 2001, according to ESPN Stats & Information Group: the 2001 St. Louis Rams, who went 14-2 and lost the Super Bowl to the Patriots. And only 13 teams out of 575 from 2001 to 2018 have finished a positive differential of least 2.0 net yards per pass play for a full season. That’s 2.3 percent of teams. The combined record of these 13 teams elite at winning the passing battle? 164-44 (.788).

This edition of the 49ers is the first to go 5-0 since 1990. But the franchise is a storied one, having won five Super Bowls. So how does this year’s team stack up against those previous champions?

Can the 49ers sustain this level of dominance? Ideally, a team’s passing differential would be built more on a foundation of offense than defense, since defense is less reliable. While the 49ers rank second in limiting yards per pass play (4.4), they are no slouches in gaining these yards, either, ranking fifth (7.5). So both units would have to regress a fair amount to push the team below a level of 2.0 net yards — a mark that, on average, results in a 12-to-13-win season.
Looking Ahead: Week 7
Best matchup:1 No. 4 Houston at No. 14 Indianapolis (-0.5), 1:00 p.m. ET Sunday
The biggest toss-up of the week involves the surging Texans and the surprising Colts, in a game that could have big repercussions for the AFC South. Houston has the advantage under center with Deshaun Watson playing like a superstar,2 and we currently give the Texans a 63 percent chance to win the division (compared with 29 percent for Jacoby Brissett and Indy). But if the Colts win at home on Sunday — and we give them a razor-thin edge — Indianapolis would suddenly become AFC South favorites, with a 47 percent chance (compared with 44 percent for Houston). It’s not outside the realm of possibility: Brissett has played surprisingly well this season in relief of the retired Andrew Luck, rising to No. 18 in our Elo QB rankings, and the Colts last knocked off the Kansas City Chiefs before a bye last week. Either way, the time for Indianapolis to make its move is now. The Texans could effectively put the South away with a win here, grabbing an 84 percent division win probability and knocking the Colts’ playoff odds down to about 1-in-3.

Game Quality is based on the Elo Ratings of both teams. Evenness is based on how close the game is to 50-50 pregame odds. A game’s importance is based on how much it swings the playoff odds of the teams involved. A game’s Quarterbacks are judged on the QB Elo ratings of the two starters.
Biggest playoff implications: No. 9 Philadelphia at No. 12 Dallas (-1.5), 8:20 p.m. ET Sunday
Potential shift in playoff odds: 41.2 total percentage points
Whenever the Eagles and the Cowboys face off, things are sure to get testy. That could especially be the case in this week’s hugely important prime-time game, featuring a pair of 3-3 teams desperately trying to make sense of their respective seasons. After a 3-0 start, Dallas looked like the class of the NFC, but a three-game skid has sent the team’s Super Bowl odds tumbling from 8 percent to 2 percent. QB Dak Prescott is still playing pretty well, but the Cowboys need to fix their defensive problems before it’s too late. Meanwhile, the Eagles have their own issues to sort out on D — specifically against the pass — after being exposed by Stefon Diggs and the Vikings last week. Philly still ranks highly in our Elo ratings (No. 9 after including Carson Wentz’s QB adjustment), but the Eagles’ inconsistency this season has been maddening. Now, the two teams meet at the crossroads, and it’s not hyperbole to say this game could determine the fate of the NFC East, especially with their division-mates in New York and Washington posing little threat. If the Cowboys win, they’ll have a 58 percent chance of taking the division, with Philly at only 37 percent; if the Eagles win, their division odds would soar to 81 percent, dropping Dallas down to just 15 percent.
Best QB duels: No. 3 Russell Wilson (SEA) vs. No. 9 Lamar Jackson (BAL); No. 6 Dak Prescott (DAL) vs. No. 8 Carson Wentz (PHI); No. 1 Matt Ryan (ATL) vs. No. 16 Jared Goff (LAR)

Home teams are in bold.
The scoring system is nonlinear, so readers’ average points don’t necessarily match the number of points that would be given to the average reader prediction.
The readers had a great week … aside from one very bad game. They were right to be bearish about the Chargers (who lost to the Steelers at home) and the Rams (who lost to the 49ers at home), and they were more confident than the algorithm that the Seahawks would beat the Browns (which worked out well in the end). But the prognosticators were undone by their faith that the Cowboys would beat the Jets. Although Elo expected the same outcome, it gave Dallas only a 58 percent chance of winning; the readers gave the Cowboys an average win probability of 75 percent, which cost them a massive 25.1 points, on average, in the contest. That was enough to put Elo over the top, giving the system the win by a margin of 24.6 points over the average reader.
Still, congratulations to Christopher Moehle, who led all (identified) readers in Week 6 with 122.0 points, and to Jamie Porter, whose total of 416.8 points once again leads the full-season contest. Thanks to everyone who played — and if you haven’t, be sure to get in on the action! You can make picks now and try your luck against Elo, even if you missed Week 6.

In Iowa City, No. 10 Penn State outlasted No. 17 Iowa, 17-12, in a classic Big Ten slog; in Baton Rouge, No. 5 Louisiana State raced past No. 7 Florida, 42-28. Any viewer would be forgiven for tuning to the latter: LSU and Florida totaled 968 yards, compared with 650 for Penn State and Iowa. The SEC showdown featured only six punts; the Nittany Lions and Hawkeyes combined for 12.
The Big Ten has long been known for its plodding pace — one article as far back as 1993 labeled the conference’s games “boring” — but this season has accentuated those tendencies. The 23 matchups between Big Ten teams this season have averaged 48 total points, the lowest of any league and more than 6 points per game lower than the next Power Five conference, the SEC. In fact, it would be the lowest single-season combined scoring average for any league since the SEC’s 47.3 in 2015.
Over the past five seasons, the Big Ten has also owned a plurality of those low-scoring struggles — games in which both teams combined for fewer than 30 points. This year, the league already leads the country with three such games: Michigan over Iowa, 10-3, on Oct. 5; Nebraska over Northwestern, 13-10, the same day; and that Penn State-Iowa game. Big Ten teams played seven, eight and seven such games in the past three full seasons.
These games tend to turn into laughers when the likes of Rutgers or Illinois are involved. Every conference has clunkers, like the SEC in 2008 with Auburn’s 3-2 win against Mississippi State or the ACC in 2014 with Wake Forest’s 6-3, double-overtime win against Virginia Tech, in which the teams played to a scoreless tie after 60 minutes. But the numbers show that no league has more of them than the Big Ten, and very few turn into oral histories like Iowa’s 6-4 win over Penn State in 2004.
In college football circles, the Big Ten generates extra mockery for a lack of aesthetic appeal during its slow-paced noon tilts — especially when it starts to snow. At the outset of fall Saturday afternoons, the finish of ESPN’s “College GameDay” often seems to give way to a low-scoring Big Ten punt parade at noon. Indeed, behind every stereotype, there are stats to back it up. Since the start of the 2015 season, the Big Ten has had far more league games scheduled for noon (119) than any other conference (the Big 12 is next with 72).1 And those noon games have averaged 49.4 total points, even lower than the Big Ten’s overall average of 51.9 points since 2015, which is still the lowest of any league in the past four and a half seasons.
After watching a handful of these games, you might guess that Big Ten teams operate at the slowest tempo. You’d be right. On average, the league’s offenses this season are snapping the ball once every 26.15 seconds of game time — the slowest tempo of any Power Five conference. FiveThirtyEight’s analysis from earlier this season found that teams in 2019 punt from inside the opponent’s 40-yard line less frequently than in years past — but the Big Ten is tied with Conference USA for the most such punts (16).
Despite the personnel and coaching changes that come with every season, college football’s offensive evolution hasn’t been as prominent in the Big Ten. Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz is the longest-tenured coach in college football, and Northwestern’s Pat Fitzgerald and Michigan State’s Mark Dantonio have both spent more than a decade in their jobs. All three schools have long-standing, old-school offensive philosophies, and, combined, they have finished in the country’s top 40 in points per game three times in the previous 10 seasons.2 The Big Ten has brought in respected offensive minds in recent years, such as Ryan Day at Ohio State, Jeff Brohm at Purdue and Scott Frost at Nebraska. But the Buckeyes have been the only ones to light up the scoreboard in 2019 — Nebraska and Purdue are 80th and 88th in yards per play, respectively.
As poor as the league’s offenses have been this season, the defenses have been ruthless. Four of the nation’s top five teams in both points and yards allowed per game are from the Big Ten: Wisconsin, Penn State, Ohio State and Iowa. Wisconsin is the only team this century to allow fewer than 30 total points through its first six games.
That defense can be difficult to value. The high-flying juggernauts of Alabama and LSU are the top two scoring teams in the country and the top two teams in this week’s Associated Press poll. But three of the next five in the poll are Ohio State, Wisconsin and Penn State. The conference has been shut out of the College Football Playoff since Ohio State lost to Clemson, 31-0, in 2016, and perhaps it is because Ohio State was such a no-show against the eventual national champions.
But with three teams maintaining strength in the polls — though the first playoff rankings don’t come out until Nov. 5 — the conference champion is positioned to finish in the top four, even if the contenders hand each other a loss during the regular season. If that team at least scores in its playoff game, it would be the league’s first point in the playoff since the 2014 season. Fortunately for the Big Ten, neither of the national semifinals starts at noon.

* Difference in playoff odds is weighted by the chance of each outcome — win or lose — actually happening.
† Total swing includes every team in the country — not just those listed here.
There are three ranked-versus-ranked games (in the AP poll) to keep an eye on this week — Oregon-Washington, Utah-Arizona State and Penn State-Michigan — but the one that could shake up the College Football Playoff odds most is happening in Seattle. Despite an early-season loss to Auburn, Oregon currently has a 14 percent chance of making the playoff, which is eighth-highest of any team in FBS. A lot of that is tied up in the Ducks’ chance of winning the Pac-12; at 53 percent, they’re the fourth-most-likely conference champ right now, trailing only Clemson (80 percent to win the ACC), Appalachian State (66 percent in the Sun Belt) and Oklahoma (59 percent in the Big 12). Oregon will face the biggest obstacle to its conference title plans this weekend, in the form of a trip to Washington. In addition to having their own outside shot at the playoff (2 percent), the Huskies have a 42 percent chance of knocking off the Ducks at home, easily the biggest upset threat any legit contender will face this week. An Oregon win would boost the Ducks’ playoff chances up to 23 percent; a Washington win would not only torpedo Oregon’s playoff bid but also create some breathing room for other top teams such as Oklahoma, Ohio State, Georgia and even Clemson. Not even Penn State-Michigan can say it offers up the same ripple effects across the college football landscape.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/two-weeks-in-impeachment-is-becoming-more-popular/,2019-10-15,,,features,"Oct. 9, 2019","Two Weeks In, Impeachment Is Becoming More Popular",Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,Impeachment,"It’s been a little over two weeks since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into President Trump and two damning documents were released that highlight Trump’s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.
In response to this, we launched an impeachment polling tracker to follow how much support impeaching the president had among the public — and whether new revelations in this unfolding saga would change their minds. And based on polls released on or before Sept. 19 (before the Ukraine story broke open), support for impeachment initially sat at 40.1 percent, and opposition was at 51.0 percent. But that began to change after we learned more about the scandal. And now, as of Wednesday, Oct. 9, the polling consensus is clear: Impeachment has gone from fairly unpopular to having near-majority support.
According to our average, 48.8 percent of people support impeachment, while only 43.6 percent don’t support it.1 That’s an increase even from last week, when the share of people who supported and opposed impeachment were roughly the same. What’s changed? Early this week, we got a couple new, high-quality polls that showed a majority of Americans in favor of an impeachment inquiry. Most notably, a Washington Post-Schar School poll found that 58 percent of Americans agreed with the House’s decision to start an impeachment inquiry, and only 38 percent disagreed with it. And an Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP poll found that 55 percent approved of the House’s decision and 44 percent disapproved of it.
Going forward, I’ll be watching whether the — dare we say it — popularity of impeachment (support now outweighs opposition by 5.2 percentage points) is sustainable. One thing to keep in mind is that both of those polls asked a relatively mild version of the impeachment question — e.g., “Do you approve or disapprove [of] Congress’s decision to open an impeachment inquiry on President Trump?” as opposed to something like, “Do you believe President Trump should be impeached and removed from office?” And both pollsters did find better numbers for Trump when they asked questions like if respondents supported removal from office — 49 percent said they did in the Washington Post-Schar School poll, while IBD/TIPP found that those who are following the Ukraine story were divided on the question of whether Trump’s actions rise to the level of an impeachable offense (50 percent yes; 46 percent no).2
An additional development to watch is whether rising support for impeachment reflects anything more than the Democratic rank and file coalescing around its party’s now-stated pro-impeachment position — more than four-fifths of Democrats are now behind it. But our tracker also finds that support for impeachment is rising among independents and Republicans, too:
From Sept. 19 to Oct. 9, backing for impeachment among Democrats has increased by 11.2 points (from 71.6 percent support to 82.8 percent support). But backing has also increased among independents by 9.6 points (from 33.9 percent to 43.5 percent). Even some Republicans have had a change of heart: Their support for impeachment has increased by 4.1 points, from 9.7 percent to 13.8 percent.
This is obviously not great for Trump: Independent voters could, in theory, decide his 2020 reelection fate. And the fact that some Republicans are also moving in favor of impeachment is worrisome for him, too. Although the absolute number of Republicans who support impeachment (13.8 percent) is still quite small, it is notable that they haven’t proved totally immovable in the face of events.
Of course, it’s not a given that rising support for impeachment will result in future political difficulties for the president either; keep an eye on measures like his approval rating and the generic congressional ballot, too. Things could also change in the coming weeks, as new developments in this story emerge — but as things sit now, almost half of the country now thinks the president should be subject to impeachment. That’s pretty remarkable.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-raptor-metric-works/,2019-10-15,,,features,"Oct. 10, 2019",How Our RAPTOR Metric Works,Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,Methodology,"RAPTOR, which stands for Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings, is FiveThirtyEight’s new NBA statistic. We’re pretty excited about it. In addition to being a statistic that we bake in house, RAPTOR fulfills two long-standing goals of ours:
First, we wanted to create a publicly available statistic that takes advantage of modern NBA data, specifically player tracking and play-by-play data that isn’t available in traditional box scores.
Second, and relatedly, we wanted a statistic that better reflects how modern NBA teams actually evaluate players. NBA teams highly value floor spacing, defense and shot creation, and they place relatively little value on traditional big-man skills. RAPTOR likewise values these things — not because we made any deliberate attempt to design the system that way but because the importance of those skills emerges naturally from the data. RAPTOR thinks ball-dominant players such as James Harden and Steph Curry are phenomenally good. It highly values two-way wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It can have a love-hate relationship with centers, who are sometimes overvalued in other statistical systems. But it appreciates modern centers such as Nikola Jokić and Joel Embiid, as well as defensive stalwarts like Rudy Gobert.
Before we get into more detail about RAPTOR, a few “getting to know you” basics about it:
Like Box Plus/Minus (BPM) and Real Plus Minus (RPM), RAPTOR is a plus-minus statistic that measures the number of points a player contributes to his team’s offense and defense per 100 possessions, relative to a league-average player. For instance, a player with an offensive RAPTOR rating of +2.1 boosts his team’s performance by 2.1 points per 100 offensive possessions while he is on the floor. Likewise, a player with a defensive RAPTOR of +3.4 would improve his team’s defensive performance1 by 3.4 points per 100 possessions while he’s on the court.
Plus-minus statistics have certain inherent limitations, and RAPTOR is subject to those, too. Namely, these statistics assume that player performance is largely linear and additive, that is, that you can roughly add up the ratings from individual players to project team performance. In other words, RAPTOR does not account for coaching, systems or synergies between teammates.
RAPTOR consists of two major components that are blended together to rate players: a “box” (as in “box score”) component, which uses individual statistics (including statistics derived from player tracking and play-by-play data), and an “on-off” component, which evaluates a team’s performance when the player and various combinations of his teammates are on or off the floor.
When applied to past data — for instance, in evaluating who the best players were in the 2018-19 season — RAPTOR is a descriptive statistic. Descriptive RAPTOR is based solely on a player’s on-court performance and the performance of the player’s teammates, as described above. It does not use priors based on a player’s height, weight, age or any other factor.
However, RAPTOR can also be used to make team and player predictions, and indeed our NBA predictions are now fueled by RAPTOR. (We are retiring the CARMELO brand name from our previous projection system, although much of the code for RAPTOR projections is borrowed from CARMELO.) RAPTOR-driven predictions do use qualities such as height, age and draft position, and even whether a player recently appeared on an All-NBA team — that data improves the performance of the predictive measure. Predictions also weight variables slightly differently than descriptive RAPTOR does, as certain statistics are more subject to luck than others. We refer to this predictive version of RAPTOR as PREDATOR (PREDictive rApTOR).
RAPTOR is based exclusively on publicly available data. There are other player-tracking statistics we believe could be highly helpful to RAPTOR, especially more detailed measures of on-ball defense, so we hope to be able to revisit RAPTOR as additional data becomes available.
RAPTOR’s name (in addition to being a whimsical backronym in the tradition of CARMELO and DRAYMOND) honors the 2018-19 Toronto Raptors, which FiveThirtyEight’s previous projection system correctly predicted had an edge over the Golden State Warriors (even though we didn’t fully believe the projection ourselves at the time).
The full-fledged version of RAPTOR is available for the 2013-14 season onward, as that’s when the NBA’s player-tracking data came on line. We also have a historical version of RAPTOR called Approximate RAPTOR dating back to 1976-1977, the first season after the ABA-NBA merger, but that uses a far more limited range of data.
RAPTOR ratings for players with at least 1,000 minutes played2 in a season since 2013-14 can be found in the table below. As you can see, RAPTOR generally loves perimeter players and wings, such as Curry, Harden, Leonard and Chris Paul, although some frontcourt players like Jokic, Anthony Davis and Draymond Green are also rated highly by the system. For more detail on past RAPTORs, including the breakdown of box and on-off components, you can download files that list the regular season and playoffs separately, or a version that combines a player’s appearances over the course of the entire season3 into one file.

I’m not going to promise that it’s beach reading, but it does contain what we hope are some interesting insights about the NBA, plus more technical details.
Box RAPTOR
RAPTOR in many ways takes its inspiration from BPM, which was designed by Daniel Myers. BPM was designed by fitting a regression model for which the inputs are various traditional statistics (e.g., points, rebounds, etc.) and the dependant variable is long-term Real Adjusted Plus Minus (RAPM). The “box” component of RAPTOR does something similar, only using player-tracking and play-by-play data in addition to traditional statistics.
What is RAPM? It’s a measure of how many points a player contributes per 100 possessions based on his team’s performance when he’s on and off the floor, accounting for the quality of his teammates and his opponents. Adjusting for teammate and opponent strength can be tricky business, however. Mediocre players on great teams, such as JaVale McGee on the 2016-17 and 2017-18 Golden State Warriors, can have strong raw offensive and defensive ratings because they play with excellent teammates; it is obviously necessary to adjust for this when calculating McGee’s contribution to the team. Players with small sample sizes and rarely used lineup combinations can also create problems, so RAPM employs various techniques to regress their performance toward the mean. So in theory, RAPM is a truly comprehensive statistic, measuring all the tangible and intangible ways in which a player contributes to his team’s bottom line. It should also be an unbiased measure, not overvaluing or undervaluing any particular type of skill relative to its actual value on the court.
But in practice, RAPM can be very noisy, taking several seasons to stabilize. It’s also fairly computationally intensive and can be sensitive to relatively subtle choices about exactly how it’s calculated. For these reasons, RAPM is not a great measure for use in a projection system, when our data needs are more time sensitive — e.g., if we want to see how much a player such as De’Aaron Fox improves from one season to the next.
The insight behind BPM — and now RAPTOR — is that we can use other statistics that stabilize much more quickly than RAPM to approximate long-term RAPM. More specifically, we fit a series of regression coefficients using a six-year dataset of RAPM as provided to us by Ryan Davis, with the six years matching the six seasons (2013-14 through 2018-19) for which player tracking data is available. (We made a few adjustments to RAPM from Davis’s version to make it more appropriate for our specific needs.)4
In fitting the regressions, we also looked at how well variables predicted RAPM out of sample by looking at two three-year RAPM estimates (2013-14 through 2015-16, and 2016-17 through 2018-19), with an emphasis on players who changed teams from one half of the data set to the other. If a certain variable predicted RAPM well in the in-sample, six-year regression, but not in the out-of-sample, three-year regressions, that’s generally a sign that it reflects luck rather than skill or that it’s too noisy to provide for a reliable indicator of player value. For instance, data on how many 3-pointers opponents make when a player is the nearest defender is highly predictive of in-sample RAPM but not at all predictive of out-of-sample RAPM. Thus, variables like this were excluded from RAPTOR.
In addition, we used our basketball knowledge to inform our choices of parameters. For instance, 3-point attempts are a good proxy for creating floor spacing or having “gravity” — that is, drawing defenders toward you and therefore giving your teammates more open scoring opportunities. In our various regression specifications, it was ambiguous whether a better statistical fit was produced by using all 3-point attempts or instead weighting 3-point attempts based on how closely contested they were. In situations like these, we went with what made more “basketball sense”: in this case, that players who have a lot of contested threes are the ones who do more to create space. We also separately fit models for offensive and defensive RAPTORs, instead of combining them. Thus, for example, offensive rebounds contribute to a player’s offensive RAPTOR and defensive rebounds to a player’s defensive RAPTOR, rather than blurring them together. So while the regression specifications that follow might seem complex, there was quite a lot of basketball thinking behind them; it wasn’t just a matter of coming up with the best statistical fit.
Box RAPTOR Offense
The variables used in offensive “box” RAPTOR follow below. Although the list includes a few statistics, most of them fall into one of four major categories: scoring and usage; passing; rebounding; and space creation. Before being used in the regression, all variables are adjusted relative to league average. In addition, stats from the playoffs were adjusted to reflect the tougher competition in the postseason. Here are the categories in more detail:
Measures of scoring and usage
Points: This is just what it sounds like. Good ol’ points scored are in fact the highest-weighted category in offensive RAPTOR:
Usage rate: A “usage” is any shooting attempt, turnover or foul drawn that results in free throws, except for fouls (e.g., flagrant fouls and clear path fouls) that result in the team getting the ball back after the free-throw attempt.5 Heaves (shots from beyond half-court, which are almost always taken out of desperation at the end of the quarter) count as only a small fraction of a possession. Although this is complicated by the fact that RAPTOR contains a number of variables related to shooting, usage and scoring, overall it is calibrated such that players who score at average efficiency tend to improve their RAPTORs by doing so, as opposed to not taking any shots at all.
Time of possession: The value of a possession also decreases as time ticks off the shot clock. Thus, merely possessing the ball negatively predicts offensive RAPM, holding other factors constant.
Assisted field goals: In addition, assisted field goals are less valuable than unassisted ones. In some sense, this is a matter of basic accounting: If you’re giving players credit for assists (as RAPTOR does), you probably have to take some credit away from the player who benefits from the assist.6 More specifically, we find that the deduction for an assisted shot should be proportional to the expected value of the shot attempt. RAPTOR recognizes seven types of shots based on their location on the floor:
RAPTOR shot categories
Shot type
Expected value of shot*
Dunks
1.83
Shots within 4 feet other than dunks (colloquially, “layups”)
1.16
Shots in the paint but not within 4 feet
0.82
Midrange shots (all 2-pointers not in the paint)
0.80
Corner 3-pointers
1.16
Above-the-break 3-pointers
1.05
Heaves
0.08
Shot values are based on results from 2013-14 through 2018-19. They include the value of “and-one” free-throw attempts after made shots, but not free throws after missed shots, which are not officially recorded as shots by the NBA.
Source: NBA
While all players who rely heavily on assisted baskets are penalized by this statistic, it has a particularly large effect on players such as DeAndre Jordan who camp out at the basket and depend on assisted dunks. In fact, it’s essential to account for these players’ assisted field goals because they’re strongly correlated with other types of statistics, especially offensive rebounds. Failure to account for assisted field goals will bias the value of offensive rebounds downward, and some advanced stats such as RPM very likely understate the importance of offensive rebounds for this reason.
Measures of passing
Enhanced assists: Likewise, the value of an assist in RAPTOR is proportional to the expected value of the resulting shot. Assists on dunks and corner threes are considerably more valuable than assists on midrange jumpers. In addition, we give partial credit for what the NBA calls “free throw assists”: passes that result in a teammate drawing a shooting foul. However, we find that there isn’t much value in what the NBA calls “potential assists” that don’t result in baskets or free-throw attempts.7 We do, however, give players credit for …
Net passes: The NBA also keeps track of the number of passes a player makes and receives during the game, and a positive passing differential is associated with a higher RAPM in and out of sample.
Measures of rebounding
Enhanced offensive rebounds: Offensive rebounds are a tricky category. On the one hand, the value of an offensive rebound is intrinsically quite high: A team not only gets a new life on its possession after an offensive board, but it is also often in a premium position to score via a putback opportunity. (Although it depends on how the rebound is secured, the average value of a possession after an offensive rebound is around 1.2 points.) On the other hand, a lot of rebounding has to do with being in the right place at the right time. Rebounding can involve a fair amount of luck, and loitering near the basket hoping for rebounds can have negative consequences for a team’s spacing. But in general, offensive rebounds are becoming more valuable as offensive rebounding rates get lower, having fallen from 33 percent in the mid-1980s to about 23 percent in today’s NBA.
For both offensive and defensive rebounds, RAPTOR makes various fixes to the rebound statistics. Essentially, our goal is to calculate how much a rebound affects the expected value of a possession. For instance, after a missed shot, the expected value of a possession was around 0.28 points in 2018-2019 (a 23 percent chance of an offensive rebound times an average of 1.2 points scored conditional on securing the rebound). A defensive rebound would reduce this value to zero and end the possession; an offensive rebound would increase it to 1.2 points.
The NBA’s player tracking data distinguishes between contested and uncontested rebounds. Contested rebounds are more valuable, although this makes less of a difference for offensive than defensive rebounds. The intuition behind this is as follows: Because 77 percent of rebounds are defensive rebounds, only defensive rebounds on which the offense has a serious shot at the ball (i.e., contested rebounds) have all that much value for a defensive player since his team would probably wind up with the ball anyway. On the other hand, in today’s NBA, any offensive rebound is rare, and therefore any offensive rebound is fairly valuable. Thus, players provide value through contested defensive rebounds (but not much through uncontested ones) and through offensive rebounds of any kind.
RAPTOR also evaluates the location of the shot preceding the rebound, as some shots are much more likely to produce offensive rebounds than others. For instance, missed free throws produce offensive rebounds only about 10 percent of the time, so defensive rebounds after free throws have very little value since the remaining expected value of a possession is already close to zero. Layups produce high rates of offensive rebounds, by contrast — so defensive rebounds are worth more in this case.
There are also a couple of more technical fixes to the rebounding stats:
If a loose ball foul occurs on the rebound, but the rebound is not credited to a particular player,8 we give the player who drew the foul credit for a contested rebound. We also give the player who committed the foul blame for having yielded a rebound to his opponent (see below).
The NBA also keeps track of deferred rebounds: when a player has a chance at the rebound but passes it up to a teammate. Empirically,9 the value of deferred rebounds is quite high, perhaps because it indicates overall selfless play. (Think about Steven Adams giving up rebounds to Russell Westbrook, for instance.) For simplicity’s sake, however, RAPTOR simply treats a deferred rebound as being as valuable as a regular rebound. In addition, we reduce the overall number of rebounds proportionately for all players on the team based on the number of deferred rebounds for the team.
Team offensive rebounds on missed shots: We also find that the shooter has a fair amount of influence on a team’s offensive rebound rate on his missed shots. As I mentioned, some types of shots produce more offensive boards than others; players who get to the rim for floaters and layups can produce particularly high offensive rebounding rates, for instance (see table below). In addition, big men who play away from the basket (Brook Lopez, for example) can cause rebounding problems because there’s often no offensive player in prime position to secure the rebound if they’re playing out on the perimeter. We give slightly more credit to rebounds that occur (i) in bounds and (ii) not after blocked shots, since these are associated with a higher expected value for the remainder of the possession.

Positional opponents’ defensive rebounds: RAPTOR attempts to figure out which player was matched up with which opponent on a given possession based on their positions as listed in our database. The idea is that centers are matched up against centers, power forwards against power forwards, and so forth. In practice, however, there’s rarely a clean one-to-one correspondence between players at different positions. Instead, in assigning players to positions for our depth charts, we deliberately draw from multiple sources to make most players eligible at multiple positions. The upshot of this is that in RAPTOR, player assignments are probabilistic, which likely makes sense anyway given the amount of switching in today’s NBA.
Despite this being a relatively noisy process, there is some predictive power (including in out-of-sample regressions) in seeing how many points and rebounds a player’s positional matchups secure. Opposing bigs get notably fewer defensive rebounds when playing against Embiid than against most other centers, for example, both because he’s effective at boxing out and because he can sometimes draw them away from the basket with his scoring ability.
Measures of spacing
Defended 3-point attempts: Although it’s possible to imagine more sophisticated measures of player gravity, for the time being, the best publicly available metric to measure spacing is simply 3-point attempts, with an emphasis on 3-point attempts that are closely contested by the defense. This is a little tricky, though: Even shots that the NBA’s data currently describes as “wide open” (no defender within 6 feet) likely involve some degree of defensive pressure.10 Based on players’ shooting percentages, we treat the various shooting categories as follows:
Nearest defender within 2 feet: 100 percent covered
Nearest defender 2 to 4 feet away: 80 percent covered
Nearest defender 4 to 6 feet away: 57 percent covered
Nearest defender 6-plus feet away: 31 percent covered
Isolation turnovers: Our research also found that some types of turnovers — which we call isolation turnovers — are more costly than others in terms of predicting in-sample and out-of-sample RAPM. In particular, turnovers that are associated with attempts to score — as opposed to attempts to pass or otherwise contribute11 to a teammate’s opportunity to score — are associated with lower offensive RAPMs and are therefore punished by RAPTOR.12 Isolation turnovers consist of the following categories:
100 percent of travels, charging fouls, 5-second violations, offensive goaltends and baskets from below.
75 percent of lost-ball turnovers, palming turnovers, double dribbles, discontinued dribbles and step-out-of-bounds turnovers.
Miscellaneous offensive metrics
Fast-break starts: Possessions that begin with steals or after certain types of blocked shots are often highly productive, so players deserve some offensive credit for these actions in addition to their value on defense. Specifically, we estimate that a steal increases the value of a subsequent offensive position by 0.2 points, and a blocked shot on which a team comes down with the rebound inbounds increases it by 0.11 points.
Nonshooting defensive fouls drawn: In RAPTOR, the main value of drawing fouls is in the points they create via free throws. But what about fouls that don’t result in free throws? These have a small amount of value also because they (i) reset the shot clock to 14 seconds and (ii) often allow the offense to inbound the ball from an advantageous position, such as along the baseline near the basket, depending on where the foul was committed (empirically, possessions that restart after a nonshooting foul have a fairly high expected value). Thus, we estimate that nonshooting fouls drawn are worth about 0.16 points.
Penalty fouls drawn: Some additional benefits to drawing fouls are hard to measure via RAPM. Because RAPM evaluates players by comparing how a team performs when the player is on or off the court, it struggles with situations where a player creates value for his teammates regardless of whether he’s on the court. In particular, fouls that contribute to the bonus/penalty13 can increase the value of possessions later on in the quarter by making the penalty (which results in free-throw attempts being awarded on nonshooting fouls) more likely to occur. In addition, drawing fouls can put opponents in foul trouble and yield worse opponent lineups going forward. Fortunately, we estimate these effects to be small: Combined, they’re worth about 0.04 points per foul that’s not reflected by RAPM.
Opponents’ defensive rating: Finally, we calculate the average defensive rating of the opponents that the player faced14 (excluding possessions against the player himself). This is another way to account for the degree of difficulty of a player’s competition.
Box RAPTOR Defense
In measuring offense, RAPTOR is relatively elegant. The different aspects of an offensive possession — scoring, rebounding, passing, spacing — are well-represented, and the values assigned to various types of offensive statistics are reasonably intuitive.
Defense is more of an uphill battle. Some of the statistics RAPTOR uses to rate defensive performance are really more like proxies for other unmeasured statistics. We expect that the state of publicly available defensive metrics will improve in future years, and RAPTOR will improve along with them.
Nonetheless, we think RAPTOR majorly moves the ball forward on defense. The R-squared of our defensive RAPTOR regression in predicting within-sample RAPM is about 0.6, as opposed to only about 0.3 using traditional defensive statistics (steals, blocks, defensive rebounds, fouls committed) alone. This brings us a lot closer to capturing major parts of defense that have traditionally gone unmeasured.
Specifically, RAPTOR uses the following variables in its defensive regression:
Steals: Steals are an example of how defensive statistics can serve as both direct and indirect measures of player value. In our defensive RAPM regression, a steal is worth 1.49 points on defense. This is almost certainly more than the direct value that a steal provides, since the average NBA possession is worth around 1.08 points, meaning that the value of terminating a possession with a steal probably isn’t worth much more than 1.08 points.15 However, steals are also a proxy for overall defensive activity, some of which is currently going unmeasured.
Offensive fouls drawn: The same holds for offensive fouls drawn. In fact, they’re worth even more in the RAPM regression.16 Drawn fouls are rated highly by the regression both because they end a possession (often when the opposing team is in a strong position to score) and because they serve as a stand-in for stout overall on-ball defense. Players who are adept at inducing offensive fouls include Kyle Lowry, Ersan Ilyasova, Marcus Smart, Patrick Beverley and J.J. Barea. These types of players often have higher defensive RAPMs than their traditional defensive statistics would imply, and some of the reason for that is that they’ve been producing a lot of “hidden” defensive value by inducing offensive fouls.
Opponents’ field goals made and attempted: Earlier this year, we introduced DRAYMOND, a measure of on-ball defense based on the NBA’s opponents’ shooting statistics. In some ways, DRAYMOND was a first step in the creation of RAPTOR, our first foray into incorporating player tracking data into our projections. But it left two major things to be desired:
DRAYMOND placed too much weight on how many shots a defender’s opponents made, which can involve a lot of luck, as opposed to how many shots the player defended.
DRAYMOND essentially treated all types of shots equally. Our subsequent research, however, suggests that the current publicly available data on opponents’ 3-point shooting is largely noise. Many 3-point shots are relatively open shots, so which player happens to be the nearest defender is largely random in these cases, and whether the opponent makes the shot adds additional randomness. The opponents’ shooting data is quite a valuable indicator of rim protection or 2-point defense, on the other hand.
Thus, in RAPTOR, the different components of opponents’ shooting are weighted as follows:
Each missed 2-point shot when the player is the nearest defender: +1.05 points.
Each made 2-point shot: -0.33 points.
Each attempted 3-point shot, whether the shot is missed or made : +0.17 points.
As an aside, RAPTOR defensive ratings do not use blocked shots. We find that there is no additional predictive power in using blocks when projecting RAPM, once you’re already accounted for opponents’ field goals.17
Enhanced defensive rebounds: RAPTOR handles defensive rebounding as it does offensive rebounding. Contested defensive rebounds are worth considerably more in RAPTOR than uncontested rebounds. And defensive rebounds after shots that produce a high rate of offensive rebounds (such as layups and other shots near the rim) are worth more than rebounds on shots that don’t.
Positional opponents’ points scored: As mentioned earlier, attempting to infer positional matchups — and counting how many points and rebounds a player’s positional opponents secure — provides helpful information. Since 2013-14, the best and worst players based on positional opponents’ points allowed are as follows:

One advantage of this metric is that it can capture players who produce lots of blocks or rebounds at the rim — such as Kenneth Faried or Mitchell Robinson — but who aren’t very mobile defenders and might allow opposing centers and power forwards (especially stretch bigs) to score at high rates. Likewise, players who gamble on steals are sometimes punished by this statistic if they aren’t playing sound fundamental defense.18
Positional opponents’ offensive rebounds: RAPTOR also accounts for how many offensive rebounds a player’s positional matchups secure. Some players such as Hassan Whiteside are effective at producing their own rebounds but also allow opposing bigs to secure offensive rebounds at relatively high rates. Others like Adams are both skilled at getting their own rebounds and at boxing out opponents from getting theirs.
Distance traveled, for perimeter defenders only: As mentioned, current publicly available defensive metrics are more effective at measuring interior/rim defense than perimeter defense. One metric that helps a bit on the perimeter is distance traveled per 100 defensive positions. RAPTOR uses this metric only for defenders that spend a lot of time on the perimeter, based on their ratio of 3-point shots to 2-point shots defended. (It’s not particularly helpful to have a rim protector like Rudy Gobert running all around the backcourt.) This stat can pick up on some additional defensive value for Avery Bradley or Iman Shumpert types who are pesky, active perimeter defenders. It can sometimes also detect players like Harden who take their share of defensive possessions off. This metric is a good candidate to get swapped out for more precise measures of defensive activity in future versions of RAPTOR.
Opponents’ free throws made: RAPTOR deducts value for free throws made on fouls committed by the defensive player. This is its main way of punishing defenders for committing fouls. However, the deduction for a made free throw is relatively minor (0.19 points). This is because fouls, although costly to the team, are at least a sign that the defensive player is challenging shots. (If we had better measures of defensive activity, in other words, the coefficients associated with fouls and free throws would probably be more steeply negative.) In fact, in the predictive formulation of RAPTOR used in our projection models (PREDATOR), fouls are handled slightly differently: A defensive player still gets a deduction when an opponent that he fouled makes a free throw, but the defender actually gets a small amount of credit for committing a foul.
Even though players don’t really19 exert any control over whether their opponents make their free throws, free throws made nevertheless outperforms free throws attempted as a measure of the cost of committing fouls because players do exert some control over who they foul. Big men tend to make free throws at lower rates than wings and guards, so fouls committed by big men (usually against other big men) tend to be less costly. In addition, some very smart defenders (e.g., Green or Gobert) show indications of being selective about who they foul, based in part on which opponents make free throws at a high rate.
Fastbreak turnovers committed: Just as generating turnovers that result in fast breaks help a team’s offense, committing turnovers hurts a team’s defense. Thus, live-ball turnovers (i.e., steals) result in a 0.2-point deduction to a player’s defensive rating, while field-goal attempts that result in blocked shots where the defense rebounds the ball inbounds result in a 0.11-point deduction.
Penalty fouls committed: As described earlier, fouls have some costs (potentially putting the opposing team in the bonus and creating foul trouble) that aren’t well-measured by RAPM, although these effects are small. Thus, players get a 0.04-point deduction for every foul they commit that counts toward the bonus/penalty.
Opponents’ offensive rating: RAPTOR calculates the average offensive rating of the opponents that the player faced as a defender and adjusts his defensive rating accordingly as a way to account for the strength of his competition.
RAPTOR On-Off
 In comparison to “Box” RAPTOR, calculating a player’s “On-Off” RAPTOR rating is relatively simple. To calculate it, we undertook essentially the same process as for “Box” RAPTOR, regressing various offensive and defensive ratings against Davis’s six-year RAPM estimates. RAPM can be replicated quite effectively using three types of on-court ratings.20
The player’s offensive and defensive ratings — that is, how many points the team scored and allowed per 100 possessions while he was on the floor, adjusted for strength of opposition.
The player’s courtmates’ weighted average offensive and defensive ratings21 when they weren’t sharing the floor with the player. The average is weighted by the number of possessions that the courtmate shared with the player, multiplied by the number of possessions that the courtmate had without the player.22
Finally, the player’s courtmates’ other courtmates’ weighted average offensive and defensive ratings.23 Whereas a player’s raw offensive and defensive ratings (step 1) are associated with positive coefficients (It’s good if a player’s team is outscoring its opponent while he’s on the floor!) and the player’s courtmates’ ratings (step 2) are associated with negative coefficients (It’s a bad sign for a player’s if his teammates are doing well even when he’s not on the floor!), the ratings of his courtmates’ other courtmates are a positive indicator. (I know this part is a little confusing.) Essentially, high courtmates’ courtmates’ ratings mean the teammates who seemed like they were doing well without the player on the floor may only have been doing well because they were paired with other good teammates.
We find that further iterations (i.e., looking at a player’s courtmates’ courtmates’ courtmates’ ratings) don’t contribute toward predicting RAPM.
We also find that this comparatively simple way to evaluate a player’s on-court/off-court impact not only replicates RAPM extremely well in sample but also predicts out-of-sample RAPM as well or slightly better than RAPM itself, depending on the regression specification. In other words, RAPM doesn’t appear to add much value as compared with computationally simpler approaches to evaluating on-court/off-court ratings.
Combining and Adjusting Box and On-Off Ratings to Create Overall RAPTOR
Overall RAPTOR is a blend of the “Box” and “On-Off” component ratings. We determined the respective weight assigned to “Box” and “On-Off” RAPTOR ratings by testing how well they predicted RAPM out of sample. Specifically, overall RAPTOR is equal to roughly 85 percent of “Box” RAPTOR, plus 21 percent of “On-Off” RAPTOR. A couple of fairly obvious observations about these figures:
First, note that the combined value of “Box” and “On-Off” RAPTOR is slightly greater than 100 percent because they provide some nonredundant information. If a player’s “Box” rating is +3.0 and his “On-Off” rating is also +3.0, we’d exepct his overall RAPM to be slightly greater than +3.0, in other words.
Also, note that “Box” RAPTOR is quite a bit more predictive of out-of-sample performance than “On-Off” RAPTOR. While on-court/off-court ratings are sometimes treated as though they’re the holy grail of NBA statistics, they’re very noisy. Conversely, many areas of player performance that were once thought to be intractable to statistical analysis can now be measured through player-tracking or play-by-play statistics. Other analysts may differ, but we think the medium-term future of NBA analytics is probably more about assigning value to players based on discrete actions they take on the court and less in trying to perfect an RAPM-like approach.
After combining “Box” and “On-Off” ratings, RAPTOR is then adjusted in two ways. (These are the same adjustments that are made by BPM, so we are again indebted to BPM and Daniel Myers for inspiration.)
The score effects adjustment
If you’re about my age (41) and played a lot of NBA Jam as a kid, you’ll remember computer assistance, which was how the software helped teams who trailed by significant margins by magically making their shots more likely to go in. It turns out that there is something vaguely analogous to this in the real NBA! Relative to the personnel they have on the floor, teams perform substantially worse when they have large leads and substantially better when they trail by significant margins. These tendencies, which we call score effects, can have profound effects. As Jeremias Engleman writes, when a team is behind by 20 points, it’s expected to score around 6 points per 100 possessions more than it does in a tied game, which is like “replacing an average offensive player with LeBron [James].”
In nontechnical language: You need to adjust “junk time” statistics. When a team is way ahead, it tends to be less efficient, and its opponents tend to be more efficient. As a result, unadjusted statistics will tend to underrate players on good teams and overrate players on poor teams because players on good teams are more often playing with significant leads and lollygagging their way through games, especially in the regular season. In crunch time, these teams may have a bigger advantage than their raw stats imply.
Our score effects adjustment is a little different than some of the other ones we’ve seen. Instead of inferring how far a team was ahead or behind based on its average final score, we calculate it directly by evaluating how far it was ahead or behind in an average possession throughout the season. In some cases, this can make a fairly big difference. For instance, the 2018-19 Philadelphia 76ers had a lower average victory margin (+2.7 points) than the Indiana Pacers (+3.3 points). The 76ers frequently had established large leads by the fourth quarter, however, while the Pacers did not — so they actually led their opponents by a larger margin on average throughout the game. Adjusted for score effects, they were a better team, in other words. Furthermore, in examining the impact of score effects on individual players, we evaluate them only for possessions when the player was on the court, rather than the team’s rating for all possessions in the game.
Another important difference in RAPTOR’s score effects adjustment is that it recognizes that the effects become larger in later quarters. A team will coast more with a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter than in the second quarter, in other words. In addition, score effects are considerably larger in the regular season than in the playoffs. This should make intuitive sense: a team is less likely to step off the gas pedal in the postseason when where is more on the line.
How score effects impact NBA efficiency
For every 10 points that it leads by, its scoring margin is affected by ___ points per 100 possessions, controlling for the personnel it has on the floor:
Period
Regular season
Playoffs
First
-1.1
-0.6
Second
-1.7
-0.9
Third
-2.3
-1.2
Fourth and OT
-2.9
-1.5
Note that the adjustment is linear. The values in the chart reflect a 10-point lead. For instance, a team with a 10-point lead will be 2.3 points worse per 100 possessions than in a tied game. But you can multiply them to calculate score effects for any scoring margin. For instance, a team with a 20-point lead would be 4.6 points worse per 100 possessions in the 3rd quarter. Teams benefit from score effects when behind in the game, conversely; that is, they are more efficient than in a tied game.
The team effects adjustment
Finally, RAPTOR adjusts individual players’ ratings so that they sum up to reflect the team’s overall performance, adjusted for score effects and strength of competition. If the Golden State Warriors score 7 adjusted points per 100 possessions more than the league average, for instance, then the Warriors’ players’ offensive RAPTOR ratings should also add up to +7.0, weighted by playing time. In reconciling team and player ratings, we make bigger adjustments to players with higher offensive and defensive usage rates.24 Colloquially speaking, this means that if a team was better or worse than the sum of its parts, we give more of the credit or blame for that to the players who were most heavily involved with the offense or the defense, respectively.
Note that we do not apply the team effects adjustment in the predictive version of RAPTOR, PREDATOR, as it does not appear to improve out-of-sample performance. This implies that the differences between a team’s overall scoring margin and the sum of its statistical components may actually be due mostly to luck rather than necessarily reflecting any intangible or hard-to-measure skills.
Individual Pace Impact
RAPTOR also attempts to evaluate an individual player’s impact on his team’s pace. Because pace is partly a function of a team’s coach and system, these ratings were derived from an analysis only of players who switched teams, and seeing which factors were persistent in predicting pace from one team context to the next. The resulting pace impact estimates reflect a combination of essentially an on-court/off-court pace rating — how much, empirically, a team’s pace changed when the player was on or off the floor — plus various statistical inputs that correlate with pace. Both inducing and committing turnovers tends to increase pace, for instance, as does commiting and drawing fouls, and taking open shots. We estimate that the following players had the biggest impact on their team’s pace in 2018-19 (minimum 1000 minutes played):
Which players had the greatest impact on team pace?
RAPTOR Individual Pace Impact ratings for 2018-19

D.J. Augustin
-1.4
Kyrie Irving
+1.3
Ryan Arcidiacono
-1.4
Giannis Antetokounmpo
+1.3
Shaun Livingston
-1.3
To be listed, players must have had a minimum of 1000 minutes played between the playoffs and regular season combined.
Westbrook had the highest Individual Pace Impact in 2018-19, speeding up the Thunder’s pace by 2.7 possessions per 48 minutes while he was on the floor, while the Nuggets’ Monte Morris did the most to slow down his team’s pace.
Overall, we find that about half of a team’s pace is a result of the players it has on the floor, while the other half reflects the coach and system.25
Replacement Level, WAR and Market Values
RAPTOR calculates wins above replacement level using a replacement level of -2.75 points per 100 possessions. The replacement level estimate is derived from evaluating the historical performance of players on two-way contracts, who are quite literally on the fringes between the major and minor leagues (the NBA and the G League), a status that reflects the traditional definition of replacement-level players.
In contrast to our previous system, RAPTOR uses the same overall replacement level (-2.75) across different positions, although note that replacement-level guards will tend to be terrible defensively and tolerable offensively, while the reverse is true for replacement-level bigs. This is because, unlike in many other advanced stats, RAPTOR ratings tend to be fairly even across the five traditional positions. The main exception is that point guards are slightly more valuable than shooting guards in RAPTOR on average, which makes sense to us since the league’s best point guards (think of a player like Curry) often have all the skills that off-guards do, but they also have additional ball-handling and passing abilities that off-guards sometimes lack.
RAPTOR ratings are relatively even across positions
And RAPTOR replacement level is set to -2.75 points per 100 possessions….

The precise formula that RAPTOR uses to calculate WAR is as follows…
\(\text{WAR} = ({RAPTOR} + 2.75) \times {Minutes Played} \times (({League Pace} + {Individual Pace Impact})/{League Pace}) \times {WAR multiplier}\)
… where the WAR multiplier is 0.0005102 for the regular season and 0.0005262 in the playoffs.26
On our player projection pages, you’ll also find estimated market values — for instance, a certain player is worth $120 million over the next five seasons. These are designed to be slightly nonlinear rather than being a straight-line extrapolation of WAR. That is, a 10-win player is slightly more than twice as valuable as a 5-win player. The reason is that having superstar players makes a team considerably more likely to advance far in the postseason. These market values reflect how NBA teams value both regular-season performance and championships, in other words.
PREDATOR and RAPTOR Projections
As mentioned, RAPTOR now fuels our team and player projections. Or more technically, PREDATOR does, since that’s the version of RAPTOR we use for projecting future performance. The variables in PREDATOR are essentially the same27 as those in RAPTOR, but they use coefficients calculated with out-of-sample rather than in-sample RAPM. However, because we also avoided variables that performed poorly in out-of-sample tests in constructing RAPTOR, it and PREDATOR are extremely well-correlated. PREDATOR and RAPTOR have a 0.98 correlation on offense, and 0.95 on defense.
Our projections also use a variety of biographical inputs apart from RAPTOR and PREDATOR ratings that help in projecting performance going forward:
Age
Draft position
NBA career length
Height
Weight
Position
Recent All-NBA, MVP and All-Star appearances
For college players making their NBA debuts, we also use variables related to the strength of their college program and the strength of their college program’s schedule. And for international rookies who did not play in the NCAA, we use variables related to both their country of birth and the country where they played professionally before coming to the NBA. In general, players who come from wealthy countries and who play in higher-quality international leagues start out of the gate faster but do not necessarily show as much improvement following their first few NBA seasons. Conversely, players who played in worse leagues and who come from poorer countries start out slower but show steeper improvement.
Otherwise, RAPTOR projections are essentially the same as our previous projection system, CARMELO, which is described here at some length. These projections basically involve a three-step process:
Create a regression-based baseline projection of a player’s future RAPTOR ratings for the next seven seasons using his PREDATOR ratings from the past three seasons, plus his age and the other biographical variables that I described above.
Identify similar or comparable players using a number of statistical and biographical categories; for instance, Damian Lillard’s top comparables include Chauncey Billups and Ray Allen.
Tweak the player’s projection, and develop a range of uncertainty around the forecast, by seeing how the comparable players performed relative to their baselines when they were the same age as the player is now. For instance, if Allen had a better age-29 season28 than his baseline projection expected, that would favorably impact Lillard’s RAPTOR projection for this season.
Other than the adoption of RAPTOR rather than BPM and RPM as the basis for our projections, changes to our projection methodology this season are relatively subtle. They include the following:
We now calculate separate projections for the playoffs and the regular season. Differences between regular-season and playoff performance are mostly attributable to luck and strength of competition. However, there is some persistence in which players tend to perform better or worse in the playoffs than in the regular season. Thus, RAPTOR projections evaluate the difference between a player’s regular season and playoff performances in the past and carry a small amount of that gap forward to future seasons. For 2019-20, players with the largest positive playoff adjustments are Draymond Green (1.4 points per 100 possessions better in the playoffs), LeBron James (+0.9), P.J. Tucker (+0.8), Kawhi Leonard (+0.7), Nikola Jokic (+0.6), Joel Embiid (+0.6), Tristan Thompson (+0.6), Terry Rozier (+0.5) and Paul George (+0.5). And players with the largest downward adjustments for the playoffs are Damian Lillard (-0.9 points), DeMar DeRozan (-0.6), Eric Gordon (-0.6), Klay Thompson (-0.5) and JJ Redick (-0.5).
Several of the biographical variables that we employ this year are new. The most interesting one is probably awards received in the past three seasons, which is somewhat helpful for projecting out-of-sample performance. That is to say that MVP, All-NBA and All-Star voters can sometimes pick up on subtle aspects of player quality that RAPTOR misses.29
In weighting performance over the past three seasons, our projections previously assigned 60 percent of the weight to the most recent season, 30 percent to the second-most-recent season and 10 percent to the third-most-recent one. While this is a good rule of thumb for players in the middle of their career, it’s too conservative a weighting scheme for very young or very old players. Thus, the weights assigned to past seasons now depend on a player’s age. For a 23-year-old player entering his fourth NBA season, for instance, the program assigns around 76 percent of the weight to the player’s most recent season. What this means is that breakouts for young players (or declines for old players) mostly tend to “stick,” whereas you should expect more mean-reversion if a player shows a sharp apparent improvement or decline in mid-career.
Team Projections
As compared with our player projections, our process for calculating team projections is more straightforward. We create depth charts for each team and project playing time using a combination of algorithms and human inputs. Namely, we tell our depth charts program in which order the team prioritizes its players and (based on recent news accounts) which players are injured and for how long. The program then uses RAPTOR playing time recommendations to estimate how much each player will play at each position given these inputs. Players are allowed to slightly exceed their RAPTOR-recommended number of minutes per game, but if a player is playing significantly more minutes than recommended because the team is short-handed, our projections apply a penalty to his efficiency.
Once we have projected playing time, we can essentially just take a weighted30 sum of RAPTOR ratings to forecast the number of points a team will score and allow in a given game. We can then use Pythagorean expectation to estimate a team’s winning percentage. In the Pythagorean equation, we use an exponent of 14.3 for the regular season and 13.2 for the playoffs.31
One important wrinkle is that in summing up individual RAPTOR projections to the team level, we need to account for score effects. Since RAPTOR ratings reflect a player’s efficiency in a tied game, but good teams often play with a lead — which reduces efficiency — good teams will perform slightly worse than the sum of their RAPTOR ratings, and bad teams will perform slightly better than them. To account for this, we multiply the sum of a team’s player projections by 0.8 in the regular season and by 0.9 in the playoffs.
Approximate RAPTOR ratings for historic players
Since our player projections use data since the 1976-77 NBA season (the first year after the ABA-NBA merger) we also have to approximate RAPTOR ratings for past seasons, even though modern player tracking and play-by-play data wasn’t available then. This requires a few tricks that we don’t have to use on current data. For instance, to do a good job of replicating RAPTORs using older data, we have to adjust for position, giving a boost to shooting guards and small forwards and penalizing centers. We also make heavier use of a team’s overall offensive and defensive ratings than our current RAPTOR ratings do. For seasons from 2000-01 onward, we also use RPM (which accounts for a player’s on-court/off-court impact) as an input.
An interesting philosophical question is whether these Approximate RAPTOR ratings are an optimal reflection of which players were the best of their eras given the (somewhat limited) data available to examine their performance — or, rather, since RAPTORs are calibrated using only data since 2013-14, whether they essentially reflect which past players would have been best under modern conditions. Either way, they help to reveal something about how RAPTOR thinks about players. Here, for example, are the 500 best RAPTOR and Approximate RAPTOR seasons of all time, ranked by combined regular season and playoff WAR.

The 500 best RAPTOR seasons of all time
Using actual RAPTOR (2013-14 onward) and Approximate RAPTOR (1976-77 through 2012-13); all statistics reflect the regular season and playoffs combined for players with a minimum of 1,000 minutes played.

Although LeBron James’s 2008-09 is the top season on a rate basis, when he had an Approximate RAPTOR rating of +12.6 per 100 possessions, it’s Michael Jordan who dominates the list by WAR, both because he got a ton of playing time and because he did all the things that RAPTOR loves: create shots, play defense and so forth. In fact, working on RAPTOR has convinced me that Jordan’s peak was probably a little higher than LeBron’s, something I didn’t necessarily believe before. We’ll save that discussion for another time, though, as well as the conversation about how RAPTOR feels about players such as John Stockton (loves) and Patrick Ewing (hates). For more detail on Approximate RAPTORS, you can find a files here that lists each player’s rating in the regular season and playoffs separately, or a version that combines a player’s performance over the whole season.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-impeachment-is-being-spun/,2019-10-15,,,features,"Oct. 11, 2019",How Impeachment Is Being Spun,Clare Malone,FiveThirtyEight,The Spin Cycle,"Welcome to The Spin Cycle, a semi-regular look at how the impeachment inquiry is being sold to the American public by Washington-types — both those who are looking to oust the president and those looking to save him. 


The most marked quality of the last three years of American political life is the sheer number of news-making events that have occurred. Those events and their aftermath can be nearly impossible to keep track of.
Impeachment has only complicated things, which is impressive, since the facts of the Democrats’ inquiry into President Trump’s pressuring of Ukraine seem relatively straightforward. But of course, impeachment is a political process, not a criminal one — the founding fathers were vague about what “high crimes and misdemeanors” meant, perhaps so that generations of lawyers could make their nut figuring it all out.
Impeachment, as it turns out, is really about politicians selling the public on the facts as they’d like them interpreted; it’s a public relations operation as much as a constitutionally allotted power. We decided it makes sense not just to keep track of the inquiry’s pile of evidence, but also to track how politicians are interpreting that evidence and how the public responds to their spin. We are interested, in other words, in how the facts get laundered.
The facts are themselves crucially important, of course. But finding the truth in politics often means wading through ankle-deep, barnyard-sweet bullshit. The spin. The grandstanding. The press conferences in front of helicopters and flags.
So let’s be organized about this and lay things out as they are on October 11, from facts to spin to public opinion.
The inquiry’s central facts
If the Ukraine impeachment scandal was a dish of chicken Kiev, think of these facts as the chicken breast, pounded thin under the pressure of high-wattage political scandal: On July 25, President Trump had a call with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call, Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter. Text message exchanges between Trump officials and advisors to Zelensky later revealed that the Trump administration was in negotiations to secure the investigation — the Americans dangled a visit to the White House as bait. Around the same time, the White House blocked $400 million in aid to Ukraine, suggesting that the Ukrainians may have faced additional pressure to comply with Trump’s request.
An ever-expanding cast of characters animates those central facts. There’s the CIA whistleblower whose formal complaint about Trump’s call with Zelensky allowed all of these facts to be spilled out into public view — he’s the herbed butter of the chicken Kiev, bursting with flavorful information. (OK, I’ll stop.) He has been followed in recent days by a new whistleblower, who reportedly has first-hand knowledge of Trump’s Ukraine interactions.
And just this week, two associates of the president’s lawyer and America’s (former) mayor, Rudy Giuliani, were arrested and indicted for violating campaign finance law. The indictment says they helped funnel foreign money to candidates for office. The men, American citizens born in Eastern Europe, appeared to be part of a pressure campaign to remove the American ambassador to Ukraine — reportedly at the behest of Giuliani — from her post.
The political spin
The Democrats
The Democrats are waging a two-front war of sorts: one in the hearing rooms of the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and the other on the 2020 campaign trail.
On the Congressional front: In her September 24 speech opening up the impeachment inquiry, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: “The president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically. The actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of betrayal of his oath of office and betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.” She was saying the president has already committed an impeachable offense and that we already have the evidence of him doing so. No spin needed.
Of course, “no spin needed, just the facts” is a spin of its own. “Every new piece of information has corroborated the basic facts, which are devastating for the president,” Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney told The New York Times, in a perfect demonstration of the restrained (for now) party line.
To reinforce their fact-gathering mode, on October 4, Democrats sent a subpoena notice to the White House for documents relating to the Ukraine dealings. Failure to comply, the letter said, “shall constitute evidence of obstruction.” Other administration officials have since received subpoenas, as well.
On the campaign front: Democrats running for president have caught onto the idea that the de rigueur line on impeachment is “the facts speak for themselves.” Speaking at a campaign event on October 5, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has run a campaign based on what she’d have you believe is a core Midwestern ethos of not rocking the boat, said, “I think that all of us believe that the evidence is there.”
Joe Biden has been slow to stir up big news when it comes to the impeachment drama, perhaps because it’s his family’s name being dragged through the scandal. But on October 9, Biden called clearly for the president to be impeached, not just to be investigated, which was further than he’d gone in his previous comments on the matter.
The Republicans
There’s a lot going on here. It started out a little messy but a couple of weeks in, the party line on the impeachment inquiry seems to have coalesced into, “It’s a partisan witch hunt!” and stall, stall, stall.
On October 8, the White House counsel wrote back to congressional Democrats’ document subpoenas with an elaborate, eight-page long “hell no.”
Calling the inquiry “constitutionally illegitimate,” the White House is refusing to cooperate. On the substance of the call with the Ukrainian president, the letter concludes, “The record clearly established that the call was completely appropriate and that there is no basis for your inquiry.” The State Department also prevented Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a key player in the text message exchanges, from testifying before congress.
Trump, for his part, has spent the past few days trying to normalize the call with Ukraine and his requests to a foreign government to interfere in a U.S, election by investigating one of his political rivals. Trump’s 2020 campaign has released an ad that spins the phone call as innocent and the impeachment inquiry as an effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election. His Twitter timeline is a litany of tweets about the supposedly partisan nature of the whistleblower’s complaint, making liberal use of the phrase, the “Do Nothing Democrats,” and calling for Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to be impeached.
Perhaps the most interesting twist, though, is the mixed response of Fox News. Tucker Carlson, a fanatical Trump supporter, co-wrote a column in which he said, “Donald Trump should not have been on the phone with a foreign head of state encouraging another country to investigate his political opponent … there’s no way to spin this as a good idea.” On Oct. 10, the New York Times reported that Attorney General William Barr had a private meeting on October 9 with Rupert Murdoch, owner of Fox’s parent company. (“Succession” writers, take note.) The morning after the meeting, Trump tweeted angrily in a response to a Fox poll that found 51 percent of Americans think he should be impeached and removed from office. So, all is not well in the right’s political-media nexus; the inquiry is setting teeth on edge, not least the president’s.
How’s it all playing? 
All in all, there’s more noise coming from the Republican side of things. For now, though, they’re not winning the public opinion battle. According to our impeachment tracker, support for impeachment has only strengthened over the past couple of weeks. At this writing, 49.3 percent of Americans support it and 43.5 percent oppose.
So for now, the Democrats’ arguments are convincing more voters than Republicans’. But I’ll be interested to see whether the White House efforts to stall and delay will create the impression that Democrats are unfairly persecuting the president. Even Republicans’ and independents’ support of impeachment has increased in recent days, though, according to the polls.
Given a Democratic debate coming up next week, it’s unlikely that Trump will have any reprieve from the talk of his impeachment. We’ll be keeping our eyes glued to his Twitter and our ears perked for the emerging talking points.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

In an increasingly polarized political climate, adherence to party or ideological orthodoxy seems de rigueur. Social media serves only to amplify that perception at times.
But Americans’ political views are often idiosyncratic and sometimes offensive, and they rarely adhere neatly to any particular party line. In this column, we want to dig into Americans’ messy opinions on politics, morality and social mores. We hope that this exercise gives readers a glimpse into the minds of those with whom they might disagree — or agree! If you have a political belief that you’re willing to share with us, fill out this form — we might get in touch.
This week we talked with Mikayla, a 28 year old white woman from New Hampshire. She wrote, “There should be an upper age-limit on voting (i.e. people over the age of X shouldn’t vote).”
Clare Malone: So how did you come to this opinion? 
Mikayla: If you look broadly at the spectrum of issues that are pretty important — LGBTQ rights, climate change — generally you see more conservative views and more resistance to changes in those areas among older voters. And I think that’s because their values evolved years in the past when society was quite different. And so having this block of people whose views are lagging society more broadly, can, if not be regressive, be somewhat resistant to progress in areas that are important for broader acceptance of more people.
CM: Would this just be persecution of conservatives?
Mikayla: I could see how it comes across that way, because it’s certainly true as people get older they tend to get more conservative or perhaps they stay the same and society moves on. I guess it’s just that if you look among Republicans who are younger, you see increased support for climate change or LGBTQ rights. There’s just generally increased acceptance of these socially liberal positions among younger Republicans. There’s still disagreement among young Democrats and young Republicans on some of those issues and the best way to tackle them. So it’s not stifling conservative speech, it’s just allowing the debate to move on.
CM: What I’m hearing from you is that you see age and morality linked around certain issues?
Mikayla: People who are older have had a whole lifetime of influencing the political discourse already. It’s not just about their response to certain issues, it’s that more broadly they’ve been engaged in the public sphere for decades. Nothing is more frustrating to me than when you hear older voters complain about, ‘Oh, the system is so broken, the politicians are so corrupt.’ It’s like, you have been voting for decades, these corrupt politicians you’re complaining about, you literally voted into office. Another benefit of this potential position is that these people have already influenced the discourse, so it’s not as if they’re being totally silenced. They’ve had their turn, I guess.
CM: What’s the age at which people shouldn’t be able to vote? 
Mikayla: I think i’m pretty deliberately going dodge that question. There’s a confluence of factors at play there. I don’t know. This is a broad idea more than a concrete policy that I’d push to implement.
CM: Are you talking about people in their 50s and 60s or are you talking about people in their 70s and 80s? 
Mikalya: I think that if it were implemented practically, it would be on the later end of that spectrum. It wouldn’t be 50s/60s, it would be 70 maybe, if you want me to pick out a number.
CM: Part of politics and social change is about persuasion. American culture has changed pretty radically in my lifetime on some of the social issues you’re talking about. Is some of this just dodging the hard work of persuading older voters to your point of view?
Mikayla: That’s certainly a valid argument. I’ve also witnessed that change on those issues. But there are other factors that are at play as well.
Another example is technology, privacy. Those are all things that are exceedingly important. The thermostat in my house is connected to the internet. Meanwhile my grandma can’t work her flip phone. As technology is advancing at a rapid rate, it’s important to have people who understand those issues. How is the older generation supposed to hold politicians to account about the complex technology issues that require some level of regulation when they don’t really understand technology that you and I have lived with our entire lives?
CM:Does that all just come back to, well, our society is ageist and exclusionary when it comes to educating people about technology?
Mikayla: My response to that would be that it seems that some people are reluctant to do the legwork to learn about new technology. I have a grandmother that doesn’t use email. And when presented with, ‘Oh, this would be a good way for the family to keep in touch,’ she shuts down and says “I don’t want to.” It’s certainly fair that society isn’t doing the legwork, but for some people, there is some internal recalcitrance as well.
CM: When she shuts down and says “I don’t want to,” what do you think is behind that shutting down? Is it fear of the new? Fear of doing it wrong? 
Mikayla: I think those things are certainly possible I have not personally made any lobbying efforts. I could definitely see how all of those things are scary for anyone. I will step back and say I acknowledge that this is unpopular and ageist and potentially anti-conservative, I acknowledge all those short-comings with this position.
CM: How do you feel about the top three Democratic presidential candidates being in their 70s?
Mikayla: I’m really not thrilled about that. Of the three, Warren is the only one that I like and even so, I would vastly prefer someone younger. I think it’s unfortunate that none of the younger candidates have stepped up on the left flank.
CM: On the presidential level are you disappointed by the fact that they’re all older because of the things that we talked about earlier — that they might not intrinsically understand some of those issues that have to do with technology? Or does it go to a place of, ‘well, older peoples’ mental faculties could diminish sooner’?
Mikayla: For me it’s a lot more understanding, being in touch with the issues that younger voters face. I have my blinders and I certainly can’t understand issues that a lot of other people face and I think the same is true of people of a certain age. They only have their experiences growing up and the way that they’ve lived and I wish that we had more younger options just to better understand some of the big issues that are important.
CM: Do you think that you will one day become out of touch with these issues?
Mikayla: Oh, almost certainly.
CM: And you’re ok with being disenfranchised because of that? 
Mikayla: Yes. As a broad brush, obviously hard to think about how it would affect me but yes, based on the arguments that I’m playing out it does make sense to me that at a certain age your values are going to be lagging cultural advancement.
CM: Do you think we should have age limits on who can hold elected office, including the presidency? 
Mikayla: I think that’s actually even more compelling than limiting voting based on age. I think for the presidency, that’s a lot more compelling because then you should start considering mental faculties, physical fitness because of how demanding that job is.
CM: Have you told anyone about this opinion?
Mikayla: I’ve floated it with younger friends my age and it doesn’t tend to get a lot of traction. I don’t think I’ve gotten any acute pushback on it but no one seems to be that behind the idea either.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

42.1 percent of innings
The workload of starting pitchers has fallen for years, and this season 42.1 per cent of innings were pitched by bullpen pitchers, a record in Major League Baseball. But things are different this postseason. Through Oct. 13, starters had already made 12 outings of at least 101 pitches, significantly higher than last year’s postseason total of three outings exceeding 100 pitches. [FiveThirtyEight]
46 years old
MIT economics professor Esther Duflo, one of this year’s three winners of the Nobel prize for economics, is only the second woman to win the prize since its inception in 1969, and the youngest recipient at age of 46. Duflo was awarded the prize, along with her husband Abhijit Banerjee and Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, for their work on effective investments for fighting poverty in India and Africa. Duflo said she hoped her win would inspire many other women to continue working “and many other men to give them the respect that they deserve like every single human being.” [BBC News]
234,234 female truckers
According to the American Trucking Associations, the number of women in the trucking industry has grown by 68 percent between 2010 and 2018. While women represent only 6.6 percent of the industry’s total workforce, there is no gender distinction when it comes to pay. Other reasons for the increase in female truckers include continued growth in e-commerce as well as a tight labor market. [Wall Street Journal]
71 days of silence
For 71 days, the six million mobile subscribers in the Kashmir Valley could not make phone calls to doctors, customers, and loved ones as part of a complete communications blackout imposed by the Indian government. On Monday, cellphones finally started to ring again after the government partially restored service to those caught in a longstanding territorial dispute between India and Pakistan. But people on prepaid billing plans, more than 60 percent of the area’s subscribers, could not access the restored signals and internet access in the region is still shut down. [New York Times]
1,600 tainted phone booths
Problems at WeWork continue to pile up after the office-sharing company recently warned clients that approximately 1,600 phone booths at some of its offices in Canada and the U.S. are tainted with formaldehyde. An email obtained by CNBC says a member’s experience with odor and eye irritation led to an analysis and tests, which led to results indicating “potentially elevated levels of formaldehyde.” Founder Adam Neumann had to step down from his position as CEO in September after numerous news reports of his questionable style of leadership, conflicts of interests, and eccentric aspirations, including a desire to live forever. [CNBC]
8:30 a.m.
New legislation signed earlier this week means that middle schools and high schools in California will officially phase in later morning start times over the next three years, in line with research on sleep, study habits, and other benefits. The law stating middle schools cannot begin earlier than 8 a.m. and high schools no earlier than 8:30 a.m. was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Opposition includes the California School Boards Association, the California Teachers Association, as well as critics who cited parental work schedules and after-school activity schedules.

He managed Sevilla to three consecutive Europa League titles from 2013-14 to 2015-16, and he helped Paris Saint-Germain return to its perch atop the French soccer pyramid in 2018. His arrival in North London was mostly met with hope and goodwill. Arsène Wenger’s stewardship of the club had been fruitful, but it had also run its course. It was reasoned that the artful soccer Arsenal played under the smartly dressed and spindly Frenchman couldn’t win in the modern game. It was time for a more exacting tactician to take the reins, someone more inclined toward hard lines and rigorous drilling than strokes of improvised genius.1
Emery’s appointment injected excitement into a club that had felt stale for more than a decade — Arsenal picked up several FA Cup titles under Wenger, but it hadn’t won a Premier League title since it went unbeaten in the 2003-04 season — and a fan base that had been restless for just as long. But even if it was impossible to know this then, Emery’s appointment also portended the beginning of the end of club centerpiece Mesut Özil’s Arsenal career.
Özil has been featured in just 25 of the 46 Premier League games Arsenal has contested under Emery, including just one appearance this season. The German playmaker has had a few knocks here and there since Emery arrived at the club, but he hasn’t spent any significant amount of time sidelined because of injury.2 Rather, his absence is due primarily to the fact that he simply doesn’t fit with Emery’s — or Arsenal’s — plans.
A popular narrative is that Özil lacks the energy to press in the manner Emery wants him to press and lacks the defensive desire to win the ball back. Özil might be among the game’s best at getting between the lines and finding the half-spaces necessary to unlock defiant defenses, but the narrative dictates that he’s a casual defender at best and a lousy one at worst. According to the narrative, Özil is incapable of playing in Emery’s system.
That narrative would be fine if, in Özil’s absence, Emery’s Arsenal had become a pressing juggernaut and a ball-hungry monster. Maybe that will be true in the future, but the data tells a different story for the present — Arsenal is worse at winning the ball back in the attacking third under Emery than it was toward the end of the Wenger era, and it’s worse at winning the ball back in the middle third, too.

Of course, Arsenal has players who are better than Özil at winning the ball back (although to be fair, Özil is better at winning possession back than most people think). That’s not in dispute. Joe Willock and Dani Ceballos both play in attack-minded roles in Arsenal’s midfield, and they’ve both shown this season that they’re better at winning the ball back in the middle third than Özil has been recently. But the argument has never been about individual players; it’s been about whether Özil can play on a team that focuses on pressing to win the ball back. If Özil featured heavily for Wenger teams that won the ball back at equal or better rates than Emery’s current team does, it’s difficult to imagine that he’s suddenly not good enough anymore.
It’s hard to argue that Arsenal is any better off now than it was when Wenger was still at the wheel. Per Mertesacker, Arsenal’s current academy director and former captain, says the club is in the midst of a revolution — a revolution that is all about keeping possession and winning the ball back. But that revolution hasn’t come to fruition yet, and Arsenal has a whole host of other problems it needs to deal with if it hopes to reclaim past glory.
For starters, Arsenal’s possession rate has declined since Wenger stepped down as manager.3 The Gunners rank 16th in ball recoveries and 19th out of 20 teams in interceptions per 90 minutes this season. Each of these stats belies the management’s desire for the new-look Arsenal to be based on controlling possession and pressing. They also contradict the stated excuses for leaving Özil out of the team. Simply put, Arsenal isn’t playing well enough — or even how it claims it wants to play — to justify Özil’s exclusion.
Things look worse for Arsenal the closer the ball gets to its own goal. Only two teams give up more total shots than Arsenal per 90 minutes, and only two teams concede more shots on goal than Arsenal per 90 minutes. Perhaps as a result, Arsenal’s total expected goals against (xGA) is greater than its expected goals (xG) (12.88 and 11.69, respectively). Arsenal has gotten away with this so far — it’s outperformed both totals, scoring 13 goals and allowing just 11. Arsenal’s defense could hold steady, and it could keep grinding out 1-0 and 2-1 victories. Or it could regress, in which case fans of the North Londoners could be in for an awful lot of draws. That might be a fine strategy for a minnow hoping to avoid relegation, but it hardly smells revolutionary.
And if things don’t hold steady at the back, basic arithmetic suggests that Arsenal is going to have to score more goals than it’s mustered so far this season if it hopes to qualify for the Champions League. To do so, it might look to the guy on its roster who, not too long ago, came within one assist of tying Thierry Henry’s record for the most assists in a Premier League season. Özil ranks second in both key passes made and chances created among players who’ve played at least 100 games in Europe’s top five leagues4 since the beginning of the 2013-14 season.5 Arsenal strikers like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette might benefit from his presence and service.
In an alternate reality, Özil is still providing for his teammates, but in this reality, his career is in serious jeopardy. At 31, the maestro is nearly at the end of his prime — and whatever remains of that prime is being wasted by a headstrong manager and a revolution that only exists in the abstract. It’s hard to fathom, but Mesut Özil is no longer wanted at Arsenal Football Club.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nats-are-peaking-at-the-perfect-time/,2019-10-15,,,features,"Oct. 15, 2019",The Nats Are Peaking At The Perfect Time,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"After sweeping the first two games of the National League Championship Series In St. Louis, the Washington Nationals were hoping to keep things rolling in front of their home fans for Game 3. They got their wish — and then some. The Nats jumped all over Cardinals starter Jack Flaherty for four runs in the third inning and never looked back en route to an 8-1 win and a commanding 3-0 series lead.
Our model now gives Washington a 38 percent chance of winning its first-ever World Series — the best of any team remaining in the field.1 And the Nats have been saving their best baseball for the exact right moment on the calendar. Here’s a plot of Washington’s Elo rating (our power rating for a team at any given moment, where league average is around 1500) by game for the entire season:
Washington was favored to win the NL East before the year, but its Elo quickly plummeted from 1540 to 1511 as the team got out to a rough 19-31 start (causing me to, ahem, kinda write them off at the time). Back on May 21, our model gave the Nats a mere 20 percent chance to make the playoffs, much less reach the World Series. Ever since then, however, it’s basically been a steady climb uphill for the Nats, who closed the regular season on a 74-38 run after those first 50 games — the equivalent of a 107-win pace per 162 games. Without erstwhile franchise leader Bryce Harper but with a strong cast of remaining talent — including precocious outfielder Juan Soto — Washington was better this year (seventh in total wins above replacement)2 than it was last year (11th).
Not that there weren’t moments of even more uncertainty along the way. The Nats’ season was on life support late in the NL wild-card game against the Milwaukee Brewers, when they trailed 3-1 in the bottom of the eighth inning and were facing dominating reliever Josh Hader. According to The Baseball Gauge, Washington had only a 12.9 percent chance of advancing several plays before Soto ripped a bases-loaded single to right that got the go-ahead run home with the help of an error by Brewers outfielder Trent Grisham.
After that early brush with doom, Washington also had a mere 10.7 percent chance of winning their Division Series matchup against the Los Angeles Dodgers, when the Nats trailed 3-1 in the middle of the seventh inning of Game 5, before staging another massive comeback. Other teams have made the Series after even bigger scares than those — the Kansas City Royals had a 99.2 percent chance of being eliminated in the 2015 ALDS against Houston before mounting a comeback, and even more famously, the Boston Red Sox had a 98.1 percent chance of elimination against the Yankees in 2004 — but only the 2012 San Francisco Giants would have come closer to elimination on two separate occasions and still won:

So the Nats could go down as one of history’s most resilient champs if they do reach the World Series and win it. And with a 7-2 postseason record, few teams have ever peaked at a more appropriate time than these Nats. While most World Series teams are, by definition, playing well going into the Fall Classic, only two since the postseason expanded in 1995 — the 2007 Colorado Rockies and 2013 Boston Red Sox — came back from a lower Elo rating at their low point3 than the Nats will have done this year.

Do postseason hot streaks carry over into the Series itself? Perhaps. The team with the superior pre-World Series postseason record does tend to win the championship more often than not, with a 62 percent success rate since 1995. So Washington is hoping it can keep its red-hot form going through the NLCS and beyond.
Of course, the Nats still need one more win against a tough Cardinals team to punch their World Series ticket. And no matter who prevails in the American League, the Nats would be underdogs; we give them a 40 percent shot at the title conditional on making the World Series. Then again, our model has been counting Washington out all season long — and it keeps beating those odds.

Along the way, she discovered what she described as a “highly symmetric crystal” that’s needed to precisely locate the Arc. Dakota measured the crystal using her laser scanner and relayed the results to you. But nefarious agents have gotten wind of her plans, and Dakota and the crystal are nowhere to be found.
Locating the Arc is now up to you. To do that, you must recreate the crystal using the data from Dakota’s laser scanner. The scanner takes a 3D object, and records 2D cross-sectional slices along the third dimension. Here’s the looping animation file the scanner produced for the crystal:

What sort of three-dimensional shape is the crystal? No pressure — Dakota Jones, nay, the entire world, is counting on you to locate the Lost Arc and ensure its place in a museum!

Riddler Classic
Recent Riddlers have tackled Scrabble Superstrings and road trips through 48 states. For this week’s Riddler Classic, Max Maguire combines these two puzzles into one:
The challenge is to find the longest string of letters in which (1) every pair of consecutive letters is a two-letter state or territory abbreviation, and (2) no state abbreviation occurs more than once. For example, Guam, Utah and Texas can be combined into the valid four-letter string GUTX. Another valid string is ALAK (Alabama, Louisiana and Alaska), while ALAL (Alabama, Louisiana and Alabama) is invalid because it includes the same state, Alabama, twice.
For reference, the full list of abbreviations is available here, courtesy of the United States Postal Service.

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏Dan Anderson 👏 of Encinitas, California, winner of last week’s Riddler Express.
Last week, you and your friend played a game of “Acchi, Muite, Hoi” (also known as the “lookaway challenge”). In the first round, you randomly pointed up, down, left or right, while your friend randomly looked in one of those four directions. If your friend looked in the same direction you pointed, you won. Otherwise, as long as no one wins, you kept switching off who pointed and who looked.
Your chances of winning were exactly 4/7. There are a couple ways to go about finding that number.
As solver Alison Lynch observed, you can calculate the probabilities of winning each round and add them all up. You could only win the game when you were the one doing the pointing, which happened in the first round, the third round, the fifth round and all the other odd-numbered rounds. Furthermore, within each round, the pointer had a 1/4 chance of winning, since only one out of the four directions — up, down, left and right — matched what the looker did. Your chances of winning in the first round were therefore 1/4. To win in the third round, you must have failed to win in the first round (which had a 3/4 chance of happening), your opponent must have failed to win in the second round (again, with probability 3/4), and then you won in the third round (with probability 1/4). Multiplying these together, you had a 3/4 × 3/4 × 1/4 = 9/64 chance of winning in the third round, while in the fifth round your chances were 3/4 × 3/4 × 3/4 × 3/4 × 1/4. Continuing with this logic, adding up the infinitely many probabilities from all the odd-numbered rounds gave you a geometric series whose sum was exactly 4/7.
The students of The Hewitt School in New York City, meanwhile, thought about it another way. They called your chances of winning b. What are your opponent’s chances of winning? Well, first your opponent needs the game to proceed to the second round, which happens 3/4 of the time (the other 1/4 of the time you win in the first round). At this point, their chances of winning must also be b — their situation is identical to yours back in the first round. In fact, any time one of you is the designated pointer, that person’s probability of winning is b.
Since one of you must be the winner, you and your opponent’s chances of winning have to add up to 1. That means b + 3/4b = 1, which means, sure enough, that b = 4/7, or about 57 percent.
Just to be super-duper sure, solver Angelos Tzelepis simulated 10 million games, finding that whoever goes first wins a shade over 57 percent of the time.

Why isn’t the answer just 50 percent? Because pointing in the first round and having that very first opportunity to win offers you a slight edge. So who says it’s not polite to point? (I do. Don’t point.)
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏Matt Friedrichsen 👏 of Overland Park, Kansas, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic.
Last week, you competed at the U.S. Open, where you were slightly better than the competition: Your chances of winning any given point were exactly 55 percent. What were your chances of winning a three-set match and a five-set match? And what were your chances of winning the whole tournament?
As solver Dennis Okon figured out, one way to solve this problem is to work backwards. Once you find the probabilities of winning from deuce, advantage-in and advantage-out, you can find the chances of winning a single game from lower and lower scores. For example, suppose you’re up 30-0 in a game. 55 percent of the time you’ll win the point, and the score will become 40-0, while the other 45 percent of the time you’ll lose the point, and the score will become 30-15. Your probability of winning the game at 30-0 turns out to be a weighted average of those other two scores: 55 percent of the probability you’ll win at 40-0 plus 45 percent of the probability you’ll win at 30-15.
You can use this technique to work all the way back to a score of 0-0, which represents your chances of winning a game at the start. If you do the same analysis for a set, you will find the probability of winning the set from different game scores, as shown in the table below.
What are your chances of winning the set?

The percentage when the score is 0-0 is equivalent to your chances of winning any given set: 81.5 percent. Your chances of winning two out of three sets are then 91 percent, and they are 95.3 percent for winning three out of five sets. Raising these probabilities to the seventh power gives you your chances of winning the entire U.S. Open: 51.7 percent in the women’s tournament and 71.4 percent in the men’s. As you can see, playing more sets gives stronger players a better chance at winning. So let the women play five sets, I say.
It’s a little shocking just how high your chances of winning are when you start with what seemed like a slight advantage on every point. Scoring in tennis is highly nonlinear: A tiny advantage in winning a point snowballs into a big probability shift over the course of an entire match. Riddler Nation Hall-of-Famer Diarmuid Early elegantly captured this nonlinearity in a single graph, where you can see how quickly your chances of winning a set and a match change as your probability of winning each point crosses 50 percent:
Sure enough, winning 55 percent of points does not make you “slightly better than the competition,” as the puzzle stated — instead, it puts you squarely in the pantheon of tennis’s all-time greats! Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have all won approximately 55 percent of their career points.
Finally, if you’d like to play around with these percentages for yourself, check out this tennis calculator by Mark Bennett. It will serve you well.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-supporters-used-to-say-sanders-was-their-second-choice-now-they-say-warren/,2019-10-14,,,features,"Oct. 14, 2019",Biden Supporters Used To Say Sanders Was Their Second Choice — Now They Say Warren,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"On the eve of the fourth Democratic primary debate, the top tier of presidential candidates is arguably down to two or three. We’ve already seen a handful of candidates rise and fall this year, and with 16 weeks left until the Iowa caucus, there is still plenty of time for that to happen again before a single vote is actually cast.
So let’s once again look at polls that ask Democratic voters who their second choice for president is, as this helps us understand who stands to benefit if one of the candidates falters in the polls. For example, if you read my piece on voters’ second choices shortly after the first debate in June, you could have predicted that Sen. Kamala Harris’s subsequent decline in the polls would be good news for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, as there was a fair amount of overlap in their supporters.
And since the third Democratic debate about a month ago, I’ve seen four national Democratic primary polls that asked respondents for their backup candidates. Interestingly, the polls’ numbers didn’t always agree. Still, there are a few takeaways I think are common to all four.
But first — the polls. Immediately after the September debate (specifically, Sept. 13-16), Civiqs conducted a poll that found that Warren was the first choice for 30 percent of respondents, Biden was first choice for 24 percent, Sen. Bernie Sanders for 14 percent, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg for 7 percent and Harris for 6 percent. And as for second-place picks, there was a close race for second place among Warren supporters — Sanders, Buttigieg and Harris were all popular picks. But among a plurality of Biden supporters (37 percent), Warren was the clear second choice. Additionally, over half of Sanders supporters went with Warren as their second choice; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (11 percent) was the only other second-choice candidate who registered in the double digits with them. As for supporters of other candidates, their sample sizes were too small (fewer than 100 respondents) to be useful.
Over the same date range, NBC and The Wall Street Journal conducted a poll that found that Biden was the first choice of 31 percent of Democrats, Warren 25 percent, Sanders 14 percent, Buttigieg 7 percent and Harris 5 percent. But while Warren was still the top second choice of Biden supporters, not as many (27 percent instead of 37 percent) picked her as No. 2 in this poll. Sanders (16 percent of Biden supporters) and Buttigieg (15 percent) weren’t far behind either. As for Warren supporters, their most popular second choice was Sanders at 29 percent, with Biden (18 percent), Harris (16 percent) and Buttigieg (15 percent) also getting respectable shares.
In addition, Morning Consult asks voters for their second choices as part of its weekly tracking poll, the most recent of which was conducted Sept. 30 to Oct. 6. When asked who their first choice for president was, 33 percent of respondents said Biden, 21 percent said Warren, 19 percent said Sanders, 6 percent said Harris and 5 percent said Buttigieg. And although Warren was still the top second choice of Biden supporters, Biden was also the top second choice of Warren supporters. Morning Consult’s results also strongly disagreed with the Civiqs poll — according to Morning Consult, Biden was also the top second choice of Sanders supporters. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that Morning Consult has consistently shown good numbers for Biden (better than many other pollsters), which could help explain why Biden is such a popular second-choice pick here.
Finally, in a Fox News poll conducted just last week (Oct. 6-8), Biden was the first choice of 32 percent of respondents, Warren 22 percent, Sanders 17 percent, Harris 5 percent and Buttigieg 4 percent. Although it too was a good poll for Biden overall, its second-choice data was more similar to that of the Civiqs and NBC/Wall Street Journal polls. Among Warren supporters, Sanders was the top second choice with 24 percent, followed by Biden at 17 percent; Harris and Buttigieg were tied with 16 percent. And among Biden supporters, Warren (30 percent) and Sanders (26 percent) were both popular second choices; Harris (11 percent) and Buttigieg (9 percent) were further back.
Despite the polls’ occasional disagreements, I still think there are a few conclusions we can draw from this data:
There is more overlap between Biden and Warren fans than conventional wisdom suggests. One thing all four polls agree on is that a plurality of Biden supporters have Warren as their second choice. It actually used to be Sanders in this position — back when Sanders was in second place overall. But now that Warren has steadily risen in the polls to surpass Sanders, it makes sense that she is now the most popular second choice as well. But I think this runs counter to what a lot of people expect, as there’s a tendency to assume that because Warren is emerging as Biden’s biggest threat to winning the nomination, that means Biden supporters will react hostilely toward her. In reality, most Democratic voters feel positively toward both Warren and Biden. So while there are signs that “lanes” do exist in the Democratic primary (such as the many Sanders-Warren or Warren-Sanders voters), their importance is easy to overstate. Even if it may not make sense to some (especially those who look at the primary through an ideological lens), the data suggests that, if Biden’s support bottomed out tomorrow, Warren would have the most to gain.
Similarly, Warren has a lot of potential to gain ground from Sanders supporters — although other candidates might too. Since he was hospitalized with what was later revealed to be a heart attack, Sanders’s RealClearPolitics polling average has dipped by 2.6 points. If that continues — or if Sanders drops out of the race — the Civiqs poll suggests Warren could inherit more than half of his base. That certainly makes ideological sense given the pair’s shared philosophy of economic progressivism. But if Morning Consult is correct, Biden would also add to his stable of supporters, which also might make sense identity-wise (both Biden and Sanders are targeting their message to the working class). It could even be a boon to lower-tier candidates like Gabbard, for whom every extra percentage point is precious currency that could get them invited to future debates.
Finally, building on the previous two takeaways, Warren has a lot of upside generally. Not only does she have lots of potential supporters currently in the Biden and Sanders camps, but she is also the top second choice among supporters of many lower-tier candidates. According to Morning Consult, she leads Biden by 8 points among Harris supporters and by 10 points among Buttigieg supporters. Granted, those candidates are currently polling low enough that, even if they dropped out, it probably wouldn’t change the race too much. But taken together with the data from Biden and Sanders supporters, they show how much room Warren still has to grow. Frighteningly for other candidates, even with her polling numbers at an all-time high, Warren has yet to hit her ceiling.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

14 rivers flooded
Torrential rain from Typhoon Hagibis has extensively damaged several parts of Japan, leaving more than 376,000 homes without electricity, according to a government spokesperson. Death tolls varied between 14 and 33 people, and the public broadcaster NHK said that 14 rivers across the country had flooded after the typhoon arrived in Tokyo on Saturday evening. One woman died after an attempted rescue by helicopter. [The Associated Press]
68 years in the marriage industry
After 68 years in the business of quick weddings in Las Vegas, Charolette Richards wants to retire. The 86-year-old has owned A Little White Wedding Chapel since 1991 and is an originator of 10-minute nuptials. She estimates that she has done more than 50,000 drive-through weddings. Her current asking price for the chapel is $12 million. [The New York Times]
$125,421 per screen
Box office numbers confirm the hottest ticket in New York and Los Angeles this past weekend was to Bong Joon-Ho’s latest genre-crossing film, “Parasite.” The South Korean movie about the interconnected lives of two families earned a total gross of $376,274 and a per screen average of $125,421, a remarkably high number. If you didn’t get tickets to one of the sold-out events, the distributor NEON will expand its availability to more than two dozen screens next weekend, including to additional cities. [The Wrap]
2:14:04
Kenyan marathoner Brigid Kosgei smashed the women’s marathon world record in Chicago this weekend, crossing the finish line in an astonishing 2 hours, 14 minutes and 4 seconds. The previous women’s marathon record set by British runner Paula Radcliffe had stood for 16 years, and Kosgei beat it by 81 seconds, wearing the same controversial — but clearly effective — Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% running shoes as Eliud Kipchoge, who unofficially broke a men’s marathon record this weekend. Kosgei already has a new goal in mind: “I think 2:10 is possible for a lady.” [Runner’s World]
7,900 acres
A quick-moving blaze in Los Angeles that officials have named the Saddleridge Fire has destroyed more than 7,900 acres and killed three people, according to officials. The fire started late on Thursday “in the northernmost Los Angeles County neighborhood of Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley,” and Cal Fire said 33 percent of it was contained as of Saturday night local time. More than 1,000 firefighters have been assigned to manage Saddleridge, which the Los Angeles Fire Department says has damaged at least 31 structures, 13 of them completely destroyed. [National Public Radio]
2.6 million dead fish
Northern Harvest Sea Farms, a Norwegian-owned company operating in southern Newfoundland, says the number of farmed salmon that died at its facilities is actually an estimated 2.6 million. The company said the mass die-off was due to “a prolonged period of high water temperatures.” [The Canadian Press/Globe and Mail]

So I’m not going to give you one of those grandiose overviews of the Democratic primary. Maybe we’ll be more in the mood for one after this week’s debate.
Nope, I just want to make a narrower point: Joe Biden is still doing reasonably well in the polls.
Elizabeth Warren’s doing well, too! She probably hasn’t overtaken Biden in national polls, yet, but it’s pretty darn close — close enough that she was momentarily ahead in one national polling average (from RealClearPolitics) last week. You’d certainly rather be in Warren’s shoes than Biden’s in Iowa and New Hampshire. (Although not in South Carolina, and the Super Tuesday states aren’t so clear.) In fact, if you want to argue that she’s the most likely nominee, I don’t have any real problem with that. I also don’t have any real problem if you think it’s Biden, or that it’s too close to call.
But Warren’s gains have come mostly at the expense of the rest of the field — from Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, in particular — and from other candidates, such as Cory Booker, whose campaigns never really took off in the first place. Relatively little of Warren’s increased support has come from Biden, whose topline numbers have mostly been steady.
In fact, Biden’s numbers haven’t declined at all since President Trump’s phone call with Ukraine became the dominant political story. We can see this by taking a before and after comparison of polls that have come out in the past couple of weeks. It’s hard to pinpoint an exact date when Ukraine and impeachment rose to the top of the news. But Monday, September 23, when seven first-term Democratic members of Congress published an editorial calling for Trump’s impeachment over allegations that he encouraged Ukraine to investigate Biden and and his son, was probably the closest thing to an inflection point. (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out in favor of an impeachment inquiry the next day; that Wednesday, the White House published its summary of Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.) So here are the results from nine pollsters who have conducted a national poll since Sept. 23.1

In an average of those polls, Biden’s still on top at 27.4 percent, with Warren in second at 24.7 percent. I don’t necessarily buy that Warren pulled ahead of Biden last week, as the RCP average briefly showed; for some reason, RCP’s average didn’t include HarrisX, which is usually one of Biden’s better polls. It’s also sort of a moot point, though. There’s no national primary, and if Warren keeps gaining ground at the rate she has been over the past few months, she’ll surpass Biden eventually.
What there hasn’t been, though, is much sign of a decline in Biden’s numbers, despite all the media narratives constantly predicting one. Here was the most recent pre-Ukraine version (all interviews conducted before Sept. 23) of those same national polls.

So Biden was at 26.9 percent on average in the pre-Ukraine polls … and he’s at 27.4 percent now. There’s been no decline at all, obviously. Warren has gained quite a bit of ground, though, having gone from 19 percent to 24.7 percent. Where is that support coming from?

If a pollster has published multiple polls in that time frame, only the most recent poll was counted. Only candidates who have qualified for next week’s debate are listed in the chart. Totals may not add up exactly due to rounding.
Some of it has come from Harris, whom Warren is competing with for college-educated voters. Some has come from Sanders. And some of it may have come from second-tier candidates such as Booker, whose solid debate performances seem to have been forgotten and who is back to just 1 or 2 percent in the polls. YouGov’s polling of early-state voters suggests that relatively little of it has come from Biden, on the other hand.
If there’s a bit of bad news for Warren, it’s that she’s already picked off a lot of the low-hanging fruit. She can perhaps grab a few more Sanders voters, especially if some are concerned over the heart attack he suffered two weeks ago. But Sanders has already lost around two-thirds of the voters that he had in 2016, so the ones that remain with him may be a relatively hardy lot. Meanwhile, there aren’t that many more Harris supporters to win over.
That’s not to say that it’s all going swimmingly for Biden, either. Although his topline numbers haven’t changed much, Warren has surpassed him on measures of enthusiasm, she tends to have better favorability ratings than he does, and, obviously, Iowa and New Hampshire are huge potential liabilities for Biden if he loses them.
But our thesis about Biden’s candidacy has never been that he’s the most perfect candidate or has run the most flawless campaign, but rather that he commands deep loyalty from constituencies that often receive little coverage from media elites, including seniors, non-college-educated whites, African Americans and moderates. There aren’t many signs that these voters support Biden solely because of name recognition, or that their support is otherwise superficial. In fact, Biden — like Warren — often does better among voters who are paying the most attention to the campaign.
Now, if you want to argue that the 70 percent of Democrats who don’t have Biden as their first choice are cooling on him, I think you’re on firmer ground. And that could absolutely be a problem for him if he and Warren — perhaps along with other candidates — are scrambling to pick up additional supporters after the early states.
To a first approximation, though, Biden’s numbers have been quite steady. Other than a post-announcement bounce, when he briefly surged to near 40 percent, he’s been somewhere between 26 percent and 32 percent in the RCP average for literally the entire campaign:
In contrast to certain other campaigns, which naively thought that Biden’s support might just up and disappear, Warren’s team has caught up to him the hard way: by building a coalition of around 25 percent of the Democratic electorate on her own, including many voters that were initially skeptical of her.
Empirically speaking, the mid-to-high-20s in the polls tends to be a fairly robust and sustainable position. It doesn’t necessarily make you a favorite to win the nomination, especially when there’s another candidate who’s polling at about the same number. But through this point in a presidential primary, few candidates who have sustained numbers in the mid-to-high-20s have completely flopped. Those numbers tend to be good enough that you’ll win your share of states (past Iowa caucus winners have often gotten around 25 to 30 percent of the vote) or at least your share of delegates. They mean that you’ll probably be one of the trains leaving the station as the field starts to winnow. They reflect a measure of success unto themselves.
All right, this is getting a little grandiose, so let’s save the rest of the analysis for after the debate. Besides, the Democratic primary just isn’t all that complicated right now. Roughly speaking, the nomination process is going reasonably well for both Warren and Biden. And while there are other candidates who are exceeding expectations,2 it isn’t going all that well for anyone else.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/starting-pitchers-are-getting-more-work-this-postseason-they-deserve-it/,2019-10-14,,,features,"Oct. 14, 2019",Starting Pitchers Are Getting More Work This Postseason. They Deserve It.,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"Bullpens have eroded the workload of starting pitchers for years. By keeping a close watch on pitch counts and increasingly specializing their pitching staffs, teams have consistently reduced how long starting pitchers work into games. This regular season, bullpens accounted for the greatest share of workload in MLB history: 42.1 percent of innings pitched, up from last year’s record of 40.1 percent.
The leash has tightened even more in the playoffs, as October became bullpen season. Only three outings last postseason exceeded 100 pitches. But perhaps the game is on the cusp of a pushback against this trend: Through Oct. 13, there have already been 12 outings of at least 101 pitches in this year’s playoffs. The starting pitcher appears to be making a comeback, as Jay Jaffe of FanGraphs wrote.
While pitchers typically fare worse the deeper they pitch into regular season games, in some recent postseasons — 2014, 2016, 2017 and early this October — pitchers were actually better the third time through the lineup than the first, according to weighted on-base average data from Baseball Savant. (Last October, pitchers were better the second time through the order than the first.) Whether in the regular season or in October, could it be that starting pitchers are getting better deeper into the game?
This season, pitchers permitted to go deeper into games, by some measures, have never performed better.1 According to data from Baseball-Reference.com, starting pitchers have been more effective as the game goes during outings of at least 101 pitches — based on opposing on-base plus slugging.

The number of pitchers allowed to go that deep into games has certainly shrunk over the years — there were only 1,028 starts in the regular season this year that went at least 101 pitches, compared with 1,082 in 2018, 1,390 in 2017 and 2,023 a decade earlier in 2009. So it may be that teams are only giving the chance to go deeper into games to the pitchers best equipped to pitch later into games — or at least the pitchers already having strong outings.
But those select pitchers and their performances raise another question: Can starting pitchers begin to take back some of the total share of pitches thrown? More teams are focusing on player development, and many of the pitchers at the center of those development efforts are having success throwing more pitches. Could this lead to a rebalancing of the pitching workload?
In the majors as a whole, pitchers have added velocity and are throwing breaking pitches with more movement. Within games this season, pitchers with a minimum of 1,500 pitches thrown averaged 93.1 mph in the first inning with their four-seam fastball but 93.8 mph in the seventh inning. And while relievers have long performed better than starting pitchers on a per-inning basis, starting pitchers shrunk the performance gap this season.
“I think where we are headed next is, ‘How do you figure out how to lengthen use of your starter?’” said Derek Falvey, chief of baseball operations for the Minnesota Twins. “The more teams think about development at the major league level, I think the more you’ll see these conversations popping up like, ‘How do you get pitchers to go deeper into games?’”
While Astros manager A.J. Hinch said this spring that he planned to be more like the Tampa Bay Rays in limiting starting pitchers’ workloads, there was no dramatic change, as Astros starters threw the fourth-most pitches in baseball. Astros co-aces Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander have continued to dominate late into starts so far this postseason. They have now combined for three of the 12 postseason starts that have matched or exceeded 101 pitches this postseason, accounting for 22 1/3 innings in those outings while striking out 32 batters and allowing just 11 hits, three runs and five walks.
Caleb Cotham, an assistant pitching coach and director of pitching for the Cincinnati Reds, said that pitchers who are “intentional in how they train and diligent in putting in the work on the right things” can use technology to work toward dramatic improvement in their skills. Cotham, who joined the Reds before this season, trained at Driveline Baseball beginning in 2014 and will be working again with Driveline’s Kyle Boddy, who was hired this month to lead the Reds’ pitching development efforts. Cotham believes that pitching stamina is another attribute that can be trained.
“Baseball is getting better at measuring more things,” Cotham said. “Having more information to then apply to individual, such as, ‘This guy’s [elbow and shoulder] internal rotation goes down significantly after 85 pitches. This other guy has lower arm speed but he maintains it. He can sustain this.’ It will be very interesting moving forward.”
“The game will probably get pretty weird, pretty soon.”

The Jets got a healthy Sam Darnold back and grabbed their first win, Pittsburgh won on the road (but in front of a lot of their fans) against the Los Angeles Chargers, and the Vikings beat the Eagles in what felt like an upset to me (though Minnesota was in fact favored). Even Washington got on the board with its first win of the season — though just barely, and only against Miami.
We were expecting a fun back-and-forth between Patrick Mahomes’s Chiefs and Deshaun Watson’s Texans, and we sure got it. What was most interesting to you guys about this Texans win?
neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): There was a lot of talk about how the Texans basically kept Mahomes off the field. Houston limited the Chiefs to just 20 minutes and 12 seconds of possession, which — according to ESPN’s Stats & Information Group — was K.C.’s lowest time of possession in a home game since the stat was first kept in 1977.
Salfino (Michael Salfino, FiveThirtyEight contributor): Watson didn’t get sacked again. That’s two games in a row now. Before this month, he’d only had one game where he didn’t get sacked previously in his career. The Texans have 126 points in those three games — and this week they left three touchdowns on the field because of dropped passes.
As for the Chiefs, I think they need to make an adjustment that probably involves running more, as much as we stats people hate that. They are exposing their defense to too much time of possession, and Mahomes is slowed down by that ankle — he has taken such a pounding in recent weeks. LeSean McCoy had eight carries for 44 yards Sunday, though I know everything was depressed by their anemic play count.
joshua.hermsmeyer (Josh Hermsmeyer, NFL analyst): I think running the ball is a great idea for teams with QBs who aren’t Mahomes. I’m not sure how much it helps the Chiefs in this game though. They got Tyreek Hill back and he scored an amazing early touchdown on a Hail Mary-type pass where he leaped ridiculously high in the air. Then Reek did a backflip after another score later in the game. The Chiefs’ overall expected points added per play was 0.16 to the Texans’ 0.19, and that was the difference in the game, to my way of thinking. So on the whole, I’d lay this loss on the Chiefs’ defense — not a lack of running.
Salfino: I hear you about the passing game. I hate the idea of running with Mahomes, as it seems to be doing the defense a favor. But guys are teeing off on him, and I can’t think of a better way to slow that down, though they did have the screen pass for the TD.
joshua.hermsmeyer: One bit of data to support Mike’s point about running, though: The Chiefs led the league in first downs per rush yesterday with 45.5 percent. Passing was 31.4 percent, which put them 19th of the 26 teams that have played so far in Week 6.
neil: Mahomes passed for only 41 yards in the second half — which is the fewest he’s ever thrown in a half in his whole career.
Salfino: My favorite stat is that Mahomes, this is not a misprint, had 116 passing yards on the opening drive (because of penalties). He had 157 the rest of the game.
sara.ziegler: I saw that opening-drive number and needed a quick refresher on exactly how long a football field is.
neil: Yes, that part is also unbelievable.
Salfino: They started the drive at the concession stand, Sara.
sara.ziegler: Hahahaha
The Chiefs have had a bunch of injuries on the offensive line. How much is that hurting them?
Salfino: Kansas City is having a much milder version of the offensive meltdown that’s afflicted the Rams. Injuries are part of the game, so adjustments need to be made. Protecting Mahomes is Job No. 1 for the offense.
neil: Mahomes has been hit 16 times in 128 dropbacks over the past three games (12.5 percent); in the previous three games, it was eight hits in 118 dropbacks (6.8 percent).
Salfino: And he’s hurt, so he should be protected more — with more blockers if necessary.
sara.ziegler: Michael, you mentioned the Rams’ offensive woes. As a very irritated fantasy owner of Jared Goff, let me ask: What the hell is going on with them?
Salfino: This is a regular story now with Goff. In his past 14 games, including the postseason, he has 14 TDs with 15 picks and 14 fumbles.
joshua.hermsmeyer: He looked lost out there. Really kind of sad. Especially for me, since I lost a bet to Mike on this one.
Salfino: But yesterday was the low point. He’s been much better at home, so to flag a game so badly against their top division rival in Los Angeles is very alarming. He generated 48 net passing yards on 28 pass plays.
sara.ziegler: Wait … what was the bet??
Salfino: I bet net yards per pass play on the 49ers and it proved predictive. 🙂
I think Josh has to eat a live tarantula on YouTube.
neil: 😂
joshua.hermsmeyer: I took the Rams over the Niners. And Sean McVay was calling aggressive plays in this game! He led the league with four fourth-down plays! (And went 0-4.)
neil: Goff’s career has been an incredible roller coaster ride. Utterly terrible as a rookie, improved in Year 2, great at times in Year 3, and now sort of settling into mediocre with the occasionally very bad start.
Maybe that is what you would expect from a QB whose production is totally dependent on the matchup and his coach’s play-calling? Good enough to look solid when the situation is favorable, but not good enough to overcome any negative factor working against him.
Salfino: I really think it was a mistake for McVay to advertise what he was doing with the headset into Goff’s ear before the snap. I assume adjustments have been made. And I think it makes Goff seem like he’s the proverbial bus rider and not the bus driver, that is, a system QB. Even if he is, why make it so easy to make the case?
joshua.hermsmeyer: It’s interesting that the narrative is that heavy coaching is what’s made Goff good. McVay isn’t the only one who does it. I’ve been told that Josh McDaniels also talks to Tom Brady the full 15 seconds before the play. So it’s not just McVay who’s coaching right up until the snap. Maybe Goff’s unevenness is because he’s just not very good.
Salfino: I never knew that about McDaniels and Brady. It seems like it should be illegal — so of course the Patriots do it.
sara.ziegler: LOL
neil: On the other side, though, the 49ers look really good. In terms of Elo rating with current starters (so Teddy Bridgewater instead of Drew Brees for New Orleans, etc.), San Francisco is now third in the league behind only the Pats and Chiefs.
And they’re doing it despite Jimmy Garoppolo not necessarily being better than average.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Yeah, I saw someone say the Niners are the rare good team with no viable fantasy players (outside of George Kittle), which kind of sums up that offense to me.
Salfino: Speaking of fantasy football, the 49ers are the least-fun great team in recent memory. It’s a committee team.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Jinx.
Salfino: Hahaha
sara.ziegler: Their defense has helped me out!
neil: Only the Patriots have more defensive expected points added this season than the 49ers. And the Pats’ schedule has been cupcake-soft.
Salfino: Darnold’s spleen is going to devour the Patriots next week in East Rutherford.
sara.ziegler: Ewwww
neil: I thought we’d make it a week without talking about spleens.
sara.ziegler: Boy, were you wrong.
neil: LOL, apparently so!
sara.ziegler: It was fun to see what the Jets could do with a functional quarterback.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Just as Tony Romo was anointing Darnold, he threw the pick that almost cost them the game (more or less).

— Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) October 13, 2019

Salfino: It sort of felt like everyone outside of Dallas was rooting for the Jets yesterday. I still stubbornly maintain that the Cowboys are a Super Bowl contender. But losing Amari Cooper for any amount of time would be very bad.
neil: Every time you think the Cowboys have turned a corner toward true contention … they fall behind 21-3 to the Jets.
This was the second week in a row when Dallas fell behind big early and then couldn’t quite claw all the way back.
joshua.hermsmeyer: If it’s true that Jason Garrett has taken over some of the play-calling (Romo kind of hinted at it during the broadcast), I think I lay the recent slide at his feet. Though the injuries obviously haven’t helped.


Cowboy players want no part of congrats from Jason Garrett. LOL! pic.twitter.com/N6bEvLAw3M
— Jim Shute (@DFWLANDSHARK) October 13, 2019

Perhaps the players agree.
neil: Guys, you’re going to be shocked by this. But Jerry Jones is avoiding blaming Garrett for the losing streak.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Find someone who loves you like Jerruh loves Jason Garrett.
neil: LOL
Salfino: Funny how Jerry couldn’t wait to get Jimmy Johnson out of town after two Super Bowls but sticks forever by Garrett.
To be fair, this throw was sort of a miracle. Darnold steps up to avoid a sure sack and then fires it perfectly almost 50 yards despite having a free rusher inches from his face.

sara.ziegler: Somehow, Washington was the only NFC East team that won this week. That’s … confusing.
neil: Well, I mean, they were playing Miami. Does that even count as a win?
Miami doesn’t want to win games, and opponents are honoring their wishes.
Salfino: That 2-point attempt seemed a little, um, fishy. I think Josh called that play for Miami.

Salfino: Falcons coach Dan Quinn deserves to be fired. I don’t want to sound glib about it, but it’s just business; he’s done a bad job. He fired both coordinators, and both units are far worse. And he took over the defense, which may be the worst in the league outside of Miami.
neil: Yes, the Falcons have the worst defensive expected points added in the league this year, even worse than the Dolphins.
The sad thing is, it’s wasting great Matt Ryan performances like the one you highlighted above, Josh.
joshua.hermsmeyer: 


Matt Ryan is the first player to have a passer rating over 133 in back-to-back games and lose both games. 
He's 55/74 for 793 yards with 8 TDs and 0 INTs his last two games.
— Football Perspective (@fbgchase) September 30, 2018

This tweet is from last year, but it shows how this problem is not at all new. It’s endless.
neil: According to Elo, Ryan is having one of the best-ever QB seasons for a team with a terrible supporting cast.

Salfino: I like Ryan a lot, but my one criticism is that he has most of his TDs in the fourth quarter when games have been mostly lost. He did get down 27-10 yesterday.
A good simple stat for whether these losses can be pegged to the QB is what record we’d expect the team to have given how many points were scored, and 33 points (really should have been 34 at least with the missed extra point) is almost always a win. Since 2015, for example, teams are 321-42 when scoring 33+ points.
neil: Drew Brees was the king of this type of season. But now Ryan knows how it feels.
Salfino: Love how Sara is low-keying the Vikings.
sara.ziegler: If I don’t talk about them, I can’t jinx them.
That’s just science.
neil: According to QB Elo, Cousins had his best game since last November.
Salfino: I think they are very good. Like Super Bowl contender good.
sara.ziegler: Mike, no. We have been here before.
neil: LET’S GOOOOOOO

Salfino: He was No. 1 in QBR this week with a 91.7.
The Eagles secondary does get you an asterisk though, to be fair.

I sort of stand by Zach Brown?
I was happy that Stefon Diggs had a great game, though. Now both star wide receivers will be happy for a couple of weeks … until the Vikings start running nonstop again, and the cycle continues.
neil: On some of those throws, Cousins had multiple wide-open options to hit for a TD.

joshua.hermsmeyer: That one busted coverage TD to Diggs for sure. There were zero deep defenders.
Salfino: This was the game circled in flashing in neon lights for a Diggs breakout.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-debates-matter/,2019-10-14,,,features,"Oct. 15, 2019",Do Debates Matter?,A FiveThirtyEight Chat,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s weekly politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Tonight marks the fourth Democratic primary debate, and although we’ve written, as a site, that maybe the race is now just between two or three candidates … there are actually 12 candidates on the debate stage. Which kind of begs the question: How much do these debates actually matter? Are they winnowing the field? Helping voters better understand the candidates?
In honor of one of my favorite debate-style questions that seems to have fallen out of favor, a quick show of hands 👋 — who thinks these debates matter?
galen (Galen Druke, podcast producer and reporter): I think debates can matter in primaries. But I don’t think the debates in the 2020 Democratic primary have mattered very much.
So … timid hand raise from me.
julia_azari (Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): 👋I think they have mattered.
perry (Perry Bacon Jr., senior writer): The DNC has used the debate qualification process to basically winnow the field — that has mattered, of course. But I don’t think the actual debates have mattered much.
galen: I don’t even think the DNC’s criteria to determine who makes the debates have mattered all that much!
The public doesn’t seem particularly interested in anyone beyond the top 3-5 candidates.
sarahf: Galen bringing the heat 🔥
julia_azari: Here’s why I’d argue the debates have mattered: 1) This field has more potential front-runners than any in recent history, with maybe the exception of the Republican field in 2016. 2) Debates offer an opportunity for front-runners to show their flaws.
It’s notable, for instance, that Elizabeth Warren has managed to get through the debates without having any bad moments so far. And with Joe Biden, his debate performances haven’t been outstanding necessarily, but his support hasn’t changed a ton either.
perry: Julia, are you saying the debates haven’t been bad for Biden?
julia_azari: Right, I don’t think they have been. Sure, the debates have showcased his flaws in a way that wouldn’t be as evident without them. (He’s slow on his feet, at times, and rambles). But the debates have also reinforced conceptions that folks had of Biden going in; namely, that he’s moderate and looking to carry on former President Barack Obama’s legacy. Entrenching the status quo still has an effect; it’s just hard to make a big show of it.
sarahf: And what about someone like Kamala Harris? Can’t we trace her highs — and lows — to the debates?
julia_azari: Harris definitely has had a series of bad debate moments, and they have mattered. She’s had lines that landed poorly in the third debate, flailed a bit on health care questions in the second debate and later faced backlash against her confrontation with Biden in the first debate.
galen: But isn’t it also true that Harris’s story is more of a reversion to the mean after her boost from the first debate wore off?
After all, she had lost roughly a third of what she’d gained in the polls by the second debate, and her fall in the polls wasn’t about debate performance.
sarahf: But her rise was!
galen: OK, sure. The debate mattered … for two weeks.
Which a nominee does not make.
sarahf: Haha, what about someone like Warren, though? Isn’t there an argument that her debate performance has helped fuel some of her rise in the polls? As Julia mentioned earlier, it is notable that she hasn’t really had a bad debate performance yet.
galen: So, I looked at this a bit before our chat, and it is clear that Warren began rising in the polls before the first debate on June 26 and 27.
And sure, you can see some upward movement in the polls in the week or so after the second and third debates. But it’s hard to chalk that up to just her debate performance because she’s been gaining steadily throughout the summer. In fact, some of her biggest gains came in the last two weeks, which was long after the third debate on Sept. 12.
perry: As Galen said, Warren has been steadily rising in the polls for months now — but I’d argue that none of the debates were big inflection points for Warren or the other candidates, for three reasons: 1) Biden entered the race with strong numbers, and he’s largely maintained his standing. 2) Sanders’s numbers have fallen, but that doesn’t seem to be tied to the debates; and 3) None of the lower-profile candidates have broken out in the debates. Pete Buttigieg’s rise, for example, happened outside of the debates.
galen: Amen to what Perry said.
The Warren story is about running a good campaign and the media loving her.
It’s not a story of owning the debates.
julia_azari: I would never argue that Warren’s story was mainly about owning the debates. But I don’t think we can entirely dismiss them either. Think of debates like vice-presidential picks: They can do a fair amount of harm, but they also rarely help.
True, this argument is more applicable to the front-runners than the other candidates — but debates are important for highlighting a candidate’s flaws.
perry: If Julia’s argument is ‘debates matter because Biden and Warren could have screwed up really bad and didn’t,’ I agree with that.
I don’t think Harris’s decline is because of the debates, but we might just disagree there.
sarahf: OK, so it sounds as if debates serve two main functions: 1) Test out the strength of the front-runners; 2) Give someone who isn’t a front-runner an opportunity to break through.
We’ve talked about the first point quite a bit, but perhaps the second point really hasn’t been borne out this cycle? Because even after Julián Castro had a stand-out performance in the first debate, or Beto O’Rourke performed well in the third debate, their numbers in the national polls haven’t shifted that much.
julia_azari: Yeah. I mean, there were brief moments where it looked like someone’s performance might shift the race, but that just hasn’t happened. And I’d argue some of the minor, yet plausible, candidates — Amy Klobuchar, O’Rourke — just haven’t had great performances, overall.
perry: Is a debate performance only good or bad if it moves the numbers, though?
Serious question.
sarahf: This feels like the old “if a tree falls in the forest” question … but yes, right??
julia_azari: I think you can talk about someone’s debate performance separate from his or her polling numbers.
Take Biden in the last debate. He got flustered when asked a question about the legacy of segregation in the U.S., and his response was a word salad in which he suggested playing a record player at night could help children be exposed to more words. It was, as Jamil Smith at Rolling Stone pointed out, a really troubling answer that underscored just how out of touch Biden is on issues of race.
But as we discussed earlier, Biden’s numbers haven’t really shifted because of the debates. Instead, I think his debate performances have staked out where he falls in a party that is increasingly split on the question of whether the party is too “woke” on issues of race, as well as whether returning to the status quo before Trump is desirable.
perry: So I agree with this, and I think the debates have shaped the contours of how the race is being discussed.
Biden’s weird comment about record players, for instance, has opened the door for people who were already against him to strengthen their case to people who might be inclined to like Biden (black voters.)
I’m increasingly convinced that I should be watching the debate for the discussions of issues, not for how the event affects the polls. So when I say the debates don’t matter, I mean in that they don’t matter in terms of affecting the horse race. I definitely think the debates matter for better understanding the divides in the party.
galen: I’ve definitely learned about the contours of the Democratic Party from watching these debates. The first debate, in particular, was interesting for showing how far to the left the candidates thought they had to go in order to win. But also …
THIS ISN’T HORSESHOES AND HAND GRENADES, PERRY!
WINNING IS WHAT MATTERS.
perry: Well, winning matters, sure. But Biden has now called “Medicare for All” too radical in several debates. That is not great for Warren if she is the nominee — since Trump and his team can quote Biden criticizing that policy.
However, the fact that the debates have all led with a discussion around health care has definitely helped frame the primary around this issue, turning the larger “electability” discussion into a policy divide (Medicare for All vs. “Medicare for everyone who wants it.”)
julia_azari: And, of course, once you’ve won the nomination, it matters what you do with your coalition. Can you keep it together? Are people disgusted with you? There’s now a whole other thing to win — the general election.
galen: I like that point, Julia, but I also think that how the eventual nominee is defined will have a lot more to do with how Republicans characterize them through campaigning than with what Democrats said about them during the debate.
julia_azari: But the debates do reveal candidates’ positions and force candidates to occasionally take firm stances.
perry: So what have the debates revealed thus far?
sarahf: That aside from Biden, no other moderate candidate has really caught on?
I continue to be amazed that no other moderate candidate has really emerged as an alternative to Biden (maybe Buttigieg).
julia_azari: Well, the revelations are limited to a degree, given the party is changing, but I’d say they include: Biden will stick to his positions on race from the early 1990s, Castro is well-versed on LGBT issues, and Beto wants to take away your AR-15.
perry: I do think the second and third debates — and the fallout from them — revealed a party that wants to move on from many of Obama’s policies, but at the same time, can’t really abide by any direct criticism of Obama.
galen: What about positions that will shape the 2020 general election?
I think, for instance, Warren’s announcement that she supports decriminalizing crossing the border — and the fact that she raised her hand in the first debate when asked if she supported it — is a 2020 attack ad if she wins the nomination. Support for decriminalizing border crossing among Democrats is also unclear. Some pollsters like NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist have found middling support (45 percent), although other progressive pollsters like YouGov Blue have found that Democrats are perhaps warming to the idea.
perry: I mean, I think Democrats will support this position and basically all of Warren’s positions if she is the nominee, although I know decriminalizing border crossings is a controversial stance.
galen: Oh, I don’t think Democrats won’t vote for Warren or support her positions, but can Democrats win a general election with only support from “get in line with the party” Democrats? Maybe. I don’t know.
perry: I tend to think that the argument that “Democrats’ liberal positions in the primary will hurt them in the general” should be tempered. After all, Trump ran a primary campaign that advocated barring all Muslims from entering the U.S. and building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. He didn’t back down in the general, and now he’s president.
julia_azari: Right, perhaps one of the more lasting messages of 2016 is you don’t have to run to the center to win.
sarahf: OK, to wrap — it seems as if there is some consensus that the debates have mattered, at least in helping us better understand where the party stands on certain issues or what direction the party could move in. And maybe the debates have accomplished more of that — at least this cycle — than they have impacted individual candidates?
galen: Here’s a take we can all agree on (maybe): The debates have mattered for political science, though perhaps not for the actual primary race.
Actually, I have a caveat to make.
There are going to be SO MANY more debates.
And they could still change things, especially as the field winnows.
sarahf: Wow, backtracking.
galen: Haha, this isn’t a backtrack. I’ve maintained that the debates haven’t mattered so far.
julia_azari: I think we’re feeling some of what we’re feeling because people aren’t paying attention yet. For people who follow politics closely enough to watch the early debates, much of what we saw confirms previous stereotypes about who the candidates are.
galen: 🙌
Julia speaking truth.
perry: My concluding thought is that I keep thinking the debates will change the poll numbers, and they just aren’t. And that’s made me rethink some of my assumptions about politics, television and the Democratic Party.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Each network’s daily news coverage is chopped up into 15-second clips, and each clip that includes a candidate’s name is counted as one mention. Our search queries look for an exact match for each candidate’s name, except for Julián Castro, for whom our search query is “Julian Castro” OR “Julián Castro.” Percentages are calculated as the number of clips mentioning each candidate divided by the number of clips mentioning any of the 2020 Democratic contenders for that week.

But Warren’s rise in coverage isn’t all about how well she’s doing in the polls, and it’s also not evenly distributed across the three networks that we monitor (CNN, Fox News and MSNBC). This week she was mentioned in 327 clips on Fox News, but only 176 on MSNBC and 108 on CNN, marking the second week in a row that she has been mentioned significantly more on Fox News compared to the other networks.
And it’s not just the amount of coverage that differs. Fox News is also focusing on stories that the other two networks are not devoting as much time to. “Hillary Clinton” and “visibly pregnant” are among the top three two-word phrases most particular to Fox News in clips about Elizabeth Warren last week.2 The phrase “Hillary Clinton” — which appeared in 17 clips on Fox that mentioned Warren, but only two on each CNN and MSNBC — appeared often in segments about Clinton’s response to a tweet from President Trump suggesting Clinton should run for president and “steal it away” from Warren. And the phrase “visibly pregnant,” which appeared in 14 Fox News clips last week but wasn’t mentioned at all on CNN or MSNBC, occurred in segments about Warren’s response to allegations that she misrepresented the details of her departure from a job as a special education teacher in the early 1970s.
If Warren continues to rise in the polls, she could get more media attention (and scrutiny) than she has in the past. We’ll be monitoring just how much attention she gets in cable and online news, and whether the amount and content continues to diverge across different media sources. Stay tuned!

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-yankees-always-have-the-twins-number-will-this-postseason-be-different/,2019-10-11,,,features,"Sep. 27, 2019",The Twins’ Magical Run Will Likely Go Through The Yankees. (Because Of Course.),Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"If you’re looking for feel-good stories this baseball season, it’s tough to top the Minnesota Twins. Picked by our model — and others — to finish a distant second in the American League Central, with only a 36 percent playoff probability, the Twins instead dominated the division for the majority of the season. Our predictions think they’ll finish the year with 101 wins, which would rank second in franchise history (trailing only the 1965 team, which won 102). Along the way, Minnesota broke the all-time MLB record for most home runs in a single season, sitting at a jaw-dropping 301 dingers as of Friday.
In other words, this Twins season has been nothing short of magical. And when the playoffs start, Minnesota is hoping that magic can counteract the apparent curse placed on the franchise by its likely AL Division Series opponent: the New York Yankees.1
Saying the Yankees have thrived against the Twins in the postseason this century is like saying the Harlem Globetrotters have tended to do pretty well against the Washington Generals. Fifteen of Minnesota’s last 18 playoff games (dating back to 2003) have come against the Bronx Bombers, and the Twins are 2-13 in those games. They’ve lost 13 straight playoff games overall,2 and 10 of those were against the Yankees alone. New York ended the Twins’ season in 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010 and 2017.
So it would be fitting for the first playoff test of Minnesota’s charmed 2019 season to be those same New York Yankees. If the Twins can make it against them, they can make it against anybody.
Minnesota’s expectation-shattering season has been an incredible team effort. Take its home run totals: Despite breaking the single-season record, only one Twin — designated hitter Nelson Cruz — eclipsed 40 on the year. Instead, eight separate members of the Bomba Squad have hit at least 20 homers (the most on one team ever), and 11 have hit double-digit dingers (tied for the fourth-most all-time).
Beyond just the home runs, the overall depth of contributions Minnesota has gotten this season is astonishing. Let’s take a look at the sheer number of raw victories each Twin has been responsible for by converting their wins above replacement3 into an absolute figure (where zero represents no wins, above replacement or otherwise) in the manner of Bill James’s Win Shares.4 (This helps us compare the distribution of total production without having to worry about all those pesky negative WAR.)
As of Sept. 20, the Twins as a whole had 299 of these Quasi-Win Shares (QWS), prorated to 162 team games, which equates to about a 100-win team by season’s end. But they were built very differently from the typical team that meets that description.
Shortstop Jorge Polanco leads the team with 25 QWS, which means he generated a little over eight total wins this season. That’s an All-Star-type season, to be sure, and easily the best of the 26-year-old’s career to date. But at the same time, it is an extremely low figure to lead a 100-win team. Since 1901, only one team with at least 299 total QWS — the 1931 St. Louis Cardinals, paced by Chick Hafey’s 24 QWS — was led with fewer QWS than Polanco’s 25.

A player and team’s Quasi-Win Shares represents three times their total, absolute wins generated. All numbers have been prorated to 162 team games.

This trend continues as you move down the Twins’ Win Share rankings. No. 2 Max Kepler (21 QWS) is also tied for the second-fewest for a player of his rank on a team with at least 299 QWS, trailing only Joe Saunders (20) of the 2008 Los Angeles Angels. No. 3 Nelson Cruz (19) is tied with Torii Hunter of those same Angels for the fewest by a qualifying team’s third-best player. No. 4 Jose Berrios (18) is tied for the second-fewest by a qualifying team’s fourth-best player, trailing only Chone Figgins (17) of, you guessed it, the ’08 Angels. (And so forth.) Hundred-win teams like the Twins are usually driven by star performances, but Minnesota’s season has been built on depth.
You can see this most clearly if you map out the Twins’ pecking order by QWS against the average for all 204 teams since 1901 that had between 290 and 310 total QWS. Minnesota’s distribution of wins created has been far flatter — i.e., more egalitarian — than a typical team as good as the Twins have been:
This is yet another way in which Minnesota has delighted its fans throughout this charmed season — a team with a different hero emerging every night is especially easy to fall in love with. But what does it mean for the Twins in the playoffs? Do teams constructed on depth (instead of star power) tend to do better or worse in the postseason than we’d expect?
Our past research has suggested that a team’s roster balance (or imbalance) has no bearing — good or bad — on its future regular-season performance, after controlling for overall record. That study didn’t look specifically at the postseason, however, so for this story, I ran another quick test trying to predict a playoff team’s odds of winning or making the World Series depending on its total QWS, the share of QWS by its top five players and the size of the playoff field, using data since 1995. The logistic regression I ran found that teams with more balance — i.e., a smaller share of wins created by their top five players — were more likely to win a championship, but the effect was nowhere close to statistical significance.
That’s not exactly bad news for the Twins, mind you, if our prior was that teams with less star power would do definitively worse in the playoffs. But mainly it’s inconclusive about whether a team like Minnesota would gain any kind of extra advantage from its depth in the postseason.
Besides, the Yankees themselves have been far from the usual pinstriped powerhouse in terms of who has been leading the team to victory. New York’s QWS leader is former Rockies second baseman DJ LeMahieu, whose own tally of 27 is also among the lowest by the top player on a team with at least 299 total QWS. (New York has 314 QWS as a team.) The Yankees’ own relatively flat Win Share distribution looks more like that of the Twins than of the typical 100-game winner.
Of course, a big reason for this is the historic plague of injuries the team suffered earlier in the season, limiting the impact of stars Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton (both of whom exceeded 30 QWS — an MVP-type level — as recently as 2017) along with countless others. Many of those players will be available for the postseason, so the Yankees’ regular-season stats are probably underselling their true star power by the time the playoffs begin. For the Twins, though, the group they’ll take to the playoffs is the same one they won so much with all season long — sans a few names like Byron Buxton and Michael Pineda. It’s one lacking in top-line star power but exceptional in its depth.
Will that be enough to lift Minnesota’s Yankee hex? On the one hand, these Twins are better than usual: Minnesota went into its previous playoff encounters against New York with an average Elo rating of 1529, while this year’s team is currently rated 1544. Then again, the Yankees are also better than usual, sporting a 1584 rating against their usual average of 1560 against the Twins. So Minnesota will be an underdog again if it does end up facing the Yankees. But one thing is for sure — nothing would help add to the dreamlike quality of this Twins season like getting playoff redemption against the franchise’s longtime postseason nemesis.

Poll of the week
Earlier this week, I looked at national surveys to see what’s behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s rise in the polls, but now let’s zoom in on the early primary states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — to see what’s happening there.
This week we have a new Fox News poll of South Carolina that shows former Vice President Joe Biden still retains a formidable lead there at 41 percent (Warren was in second at 12 percent) despite Warren’s gains at the national level. In Iowa and New Hampshire, recent surveys more closely mirror the overall national picture — Warren has gained while Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders have slipped. But there’s also evidence that someone like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg may be underestimated in national polls.
To see what’s happened in the early states since August, I averaged all state-level polls taken between the second debate (July 30-31) and the third debate (Sept. 12) and compared that to an average of all state polls fielded since the third debate for the five candidates currently sitting at the top of the polls: Biden, Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris.
And in some states, there weren’t a ton of polls during these two time periods, but we did have at least two polls for each state before and after the third debate.
First up, in Iowa, you can see a real change in the nature of the race — Biden previously led by about 3 percentage points, but now Warren has moved ahead. Sanders also slipped about 5 points, so instead of rivaling Warren for second place as he did before the third debate, he’s now in a race for third. He’s about on par with Buttigieg, who now has double-digit support in the state, although the mayor enjoyed a pretty strong standing there before the debate, too. Harris slipped in Iowa, dropping 3 points, which is similar to her performance in the three other early states.

Next up, in New Hampshire, the story is pretty similar to what we saw in Iowa: Warren’s numbers improved, giving her a narrow lead. In fact, she’s gone up nearly 10 points, far more than in Iowa. However, unlike in Iowa, Biden’s numbers have gone up, too. They didn’t rise as dramatically as Warren’s, but the jump has helped him stay close to Warren in the nation’s first primary state. Meanwhile, Sanders’s slide in New Hampshire has been particularly large, going from a near-tie for first with Biden to 15 points behind Warren. And as in Iowa, Buttigieg is now closer to Sanders than Sanders is to Warren or Biden, while Harris has fallen to the low single digits.

To some extent, Warren’s uptick in Iowa and New Hampshire isn’t that surprising given her strength with white college-educated voters and, as I wrote on Monday, her increasing support from whites without a college degree. After all, 85 to 90 percent of Iowans and New Hampshirites are white. A lot of this can explain why Buttigieg is doing so well there, too, as he also mainly attracts support from white voters, particularly college-educated ones. That said, his performance in these two early states still stands out in comparison to his mid-single-digit standing in the national polls. And this could be a promising sign for Buttigieg given the influence these two states can have on the presidential primary process — once voting begins, he could be positioned for a strong start that could take his campaign to the next level, especially in light of his prodigious fundraising.
But in our next two early-voting states — Nevada and South Carolina — the picture gets a little fuzzier because we don’t have as many polls. Biden continues to lead the pack in both states (although in Nevada, the race looks more like a three-way tie), but there just hasn’t been as much consistent polling in either state. And that’s a problem, because even though both states come later in the calendar, they are much more racially and ethnically diverse than either Iowa or New Hampshire. So these states could offer important insight as to how other more-diverse states may be leaning, as New Hampshire and Iowa look less and less like the Democratic Party.
For Nevada, we had three surveys prior to the third debate and two after, and they showed a tight three-way race among Biden, Warren and Sanders that got even closer after the third debate. Both Biden and Sanders lost some support, but Warren didn’t emerge as the beneficiary.

And in South Carolina, where we had two polls before the third debate and four polls after, it seems as if no one has been able to make a serious dent into Biden’s support, although he did see a slight dip in his numbers. Biden’s continued strength among black voters in the state has made South Carolina a crucial firewall for his campaign, especially if things go poorly for him in the earlier contests. Sanders’s decline in South Carolina has also helped make Warren a clear second-place contender (even though she, like Biden, saw a slight dip in her numbers after the third debate).

As always, though, things could shift in the coming weeks. After all, we’ve got the fourth debate coming up on Oct. 15, which could help Sanders or Harris recover to some extent, though we don’t know yet what the polling fallout may be from Sanders’s recent heart attack. But for the moment, what we do know is that the early-state polls in New Hampshire and Iowa look favorable for Warren, while Biden still holds the lead in South Carolina and Nevada. We shouldn’t sleep on Buttigieg, either — although both he and Warren have a lot of work to do to win over more voters of color.
Other polling bites
It’s still too soon to know whether Sanders’s heart attack has affected his standing in the polls, but a YouGov poll found that 69 percent of Americans think his health is “a legitimate issue.” Additionally, views were mixed about whether his campaign had been transparent about the event, with 33 percent saying it was transparent and 27 percent saying it wasn’t, while a plurality (39 percent) weren’t sure one way or the other.
The share of Americans who identify as either a Republican or a Democrat remained relatively stable during the third quarter of 2019, according to a new Gallup report, with Democrats maintaining a slight edge. Forty-seven percent of adult Americans identified as a Democrat or a Democratic-leaning independent, whereas 42 percent identified as a Republican or a Republican-leaning independent.
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make up about 6 percent of all Americans, and AAPI Data and the Public Religion Research Institute have released a new survey of AAPI voters in California, which is both the country’s most populous state and home to the largest number of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the U.S. The survey found that 56 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of President Trump, while 33 percent had a favorable view of him. And among the leading Democratic presidential contenders, Biden, Sanders and Harris (who is from California) had the highest favorability ratings.
New polling from Ipsos and C-SPAN found that Americans are skeptical the 2020 election will be “open and fair.” Just 53 percent said they had a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence that the presidential election will be “open and fair,” while 46 percent said they did not have much confidence or “no confidence at all.” There were notable differences between Republicans and Democrats, however, with 72 percent of Republicans expressing some degree of confidence contrasted with just 39 percent of Democrats.
Of the four states holding state legislative elections in 2019, Virginia is the only one where there’s a real chance that party control of a chamber could flip. (Republicans have solid majorities in Louisiana and Mississippi while Democrats have overwhelming majorities in New Jersey.) And two new generic ballot polls suggest that Democrats are currently favored to capture both chambers in the Virginia General Assembly, which the GOP currently controls. A late-September survey from the Washington Post and the Schar School at George Mason University found Democrats 7 points ahead of Republicans among registered voters and up 52 percent to 41 percent among registered voters who said they were “certain to vote.” A September poll from the Wason Center at Christopher Newport University was even more bullish for Democrats, finding them ahead of the GOP by 13 points among likely voters, 49 percent to 36 percent.
Canada will vote for a new parliament on Oct. 21, and the race is unusually tight. CBC News’s poll tracker shows the Liberals (the governing party) and the Conservatives (the main opposition) running neck-and-neck at 33 percent nationally.
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 42.0 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.7 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -11.7 points). At this time last week, 41.2 percent approved and 53.9 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -12.7 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 41.0 percent and a disapproval rating of 54.1 percent, for a net approval rating of -13.1 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.1 percentage points (46.2 percent to 40.1 percent). At this time last week, Democrats led by 6.9 percentage points (46.9 percent to 40.0 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.5 points (46.3 percent to 39.8 percent).",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

43 new accusations
Two dozen women have already publicly accused President Trump of inappropriate behavior, but a new book details 43 new allegations, including more than two dozen cases of “unwanted sexual contact.” The book is “All The President’s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator” by journalists Monique El-Faizy and Barry Levine, and draws upon more than 100 interviews to illustrate the president’s relationship with women across different periods of his life. Assistant Esquire editor Adrienne Westenfeld writes, “What emerges from the authors’ reporting is a portrait of a serial predator who hides behind wealth and institutional power to frequently harass and abuse women.” [Esquire]
$1.055 billion in unpaid dues
The United Nations is in a “serious financial crisis” thanks to unpaid dues. Secretary General António Guterres called it the U.N.’s worst deficit in a decade, and has asked member states to pay their outstanding contributions, as the organization faces the prospect of being unable to pay staff salaries next month. Out of 193 members, 64 have not paid in full. That includes the United States, which is expected to cover 22 percent of the U.N.’s regular budget. U.N. records show the U.S. is on the hook for $674 million this budgeting period. But according to a U.N. spokesperson, the U.S. owes a total $1.055 billion when you include unpaid contributions from previous years. [CNN]
389 bird species
A new report from the National Audubon Society, a bird-focused conservation group, says about 389 out of 604 American bird species are at risk of extinction if global temperatures rise by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. “Survival by Degrees: Bird Species on the Brink” was based on 140 million “bird records,” and accounted for the impact of environmental factors like sea-level rise, urbanization, cropland expansion, droughts and heavy rain. “This new data pivots forward and imagines an even more frightening future,” said David Yarnold, CEO and president of Audubon. “It’s a bird emergency.” [USA Today]
20 percent of U.S. workers
New state regulations aimed at creating safer workplaces now mean that one in five workers in the U.S. are required to undergo sexual harassment training, compared to one in 100 workers only two years ago. California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, New York and Washington all expanded training to more employees in the past two years, with New York’s new law going into effect this week. [Bloomberg]
2.2 million people auto-registered to vote
A FiveThirtyEight analysis of 2.2 million people who were registered to vote through automatic voter registration (AVR) in seven states and the District of Columbia showed turnout rates that varied between 42 percent and 54 percent. As my colleague Nathaniel Rakich writes, “Automatic voter registration began as a way to get more voters on the rolls — and the data we have so far suggests it has succeeded.” But, “… it is not a cure-all for low turnout because campaigns still need to finish the job of getting people to actually show up on election day.” [FiveThirtyEight]
11-year high
A move by the U.S. to blacklist a major Chinese operator of oil supertankers has prompted the cost of moving oil around the world to hit an 11-year high, leaving producers scrambling to find alternatives to more than 40 transport ships. The U.S. sanctions were put in place last month due to allegations that the vessels were connected to illegal shipments of Iranian crude. [Wall Street Journal]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-christian-mccaffrey-is-the-nfls-mvp-why-arent-the-panthers-better/,2019-10-11,,,features,"Oct. 11, 2019","If Christian McCaffrey Is The NFL’s MVP, Why Aren’t The Panthers Better?",Josh Hermsmeyer,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"The NFL is a passing league nowadays. A running back hasn’t been named league MVP since Adrian Peterson’s 2,000-yard rushing season in 2012. But could Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey be the one to break that streak?
He’s off to a blistering start to the 2019 season. Not only does he lead the NFL in rushing yards (587), but no running back since the AFL-NFL merger has more yards from scrimmage (866) through 5 weeks. Since losing quarterback Cam Newton to a foot injury after Week 2, the Panthers have leaned heavily on McCaffrey, handing him the ball 70 times and targeting him another 22 on passing plays. In turn, McCaffrey has rattled off a string of prolific performances, recording 188 yards from scrimmage against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 3, 179 against the Houston Texans in Week 4 and 237 against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 5.
Given his early-season exploits, it’s perhaps not surprising that some are hailing him as a legitimate MVP candidate. And so far, McCaffrey’s stats only seem to boost his case. McCaffrey virtually never comes off the field, having lined up for 96 percent of the team’s plays on offense so far this year. His snap count (309) is the highest through 5 weeks of a season since 2007 — the first year for which we have data. His 105 rushing attempts account for 82 percent of the Panthers handoffs, and McCaffrey’s 587 rushing yards also represent 82 percent of the team’s ground total.
And if we put McCaffrey alongside the 13 backs to win the AP Most Valuable Player award since 1970, he compares favorably. McCaffrey ranks third in rushing and receiving yards through five weeks, and he’s first in total yards from scrimmage.

Still, gaudy personal stats aside, there are reasons to question McCaffrey’s MVP credentials. Our Elo rankings have the Panthers as just the 13th-best team in the NFL. Typically, the league MVP — especially an offensive player — is chosen from a more successful team. Through the first five weeks of the year, Carolina’s offense has been below average. The unit ranks 23rd in total offensive EPA per play, putting them behind the 2-3 Tennessee Titans, the 1-3-1 Arizona Cardinals and the 1-4 Denver Broncos.

Meanwhile, Carolina’s rushing attack ranks 16th in expected points added, despite the large workload McCaffrey has shouldered. Somewhat shockingly, the part of the offense for which McCaffrey plays such an outsized role has contributed negative 1.54 expected points added to the team’s total offensive production. His 274 yards receiving may help mitigate the rushing losses, but the Panthers’ middling 3-2 record is probably best explained by the performance of their seventh-ranked defense rather than McCaffrey’s exploits.
And there are still other reasons to question McCaffrey’s MVP candidacy. For instance, it’s unclear whether he’ll be able to stay healthy operating under such a heavy workload. McCaffrey left last week’s game against Jacksonville because of cramps, and he missed practice Wednesday with a back injury.1
Meanwhile, when McCaffrey was out of the game last week, backup running back Reggie Bonnafon stepped in and took his second handoff of the game 59 yards to the house.


Reggie Bonnafon got the call and boy did he DELIVER!!!#KeepPounding pic.twitter.com/GXQ8mqpOlc
— Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) October 6, 2019

The notion of running back replaceability isn’t a new one, but plays like this underscore that rushing success is often the result of scheme and blocking as much as it is ball-carrier talent. You don’t need an elite talent to run through openings like the one the Panthers offensive line created for Bonnafon.
Yet, even with his linemen helping McCaffrey to historic numbers, the Panthers are a long way from being elite on offense. And that, more than anything, may be the biggest hole in McCaffrey’s MVP resume: When an offense isn’t very good, we should probably look elsewhere for the league’s most valuable player.

But the Washington Mystics were unfazed in the final few minutes of the fourth quarter as they pulled away to secure an 89-78 victory over the Connecticut Sun. For the first time in franchise history, the expansion team founded in 1998 has earned a championship title.
In typical Mystics home-court fashion, the game tipped off with fans “Swag Surfin’” in the stands. Connecticut guard Courtney Williams made the first basket of the night, a smooth layup that hushed the crowd. The Mystics’ Elena Delle Donne, who suffered a herniated disk during Game 2 (later revealed to be three herniated disks), responded at the free-throw line after the Sun’s Alyssa Thomas committed her first of four fouls. Thomas was also pushing through pain, playing with two torn labrums.
From that moment on, the game was dominated by foul calls. Nearly all starters from both sides were in foul trouble before the end of the first half. The referees seemed to constantly be blowing their whistles, and many of them were directed at Jonquel Jones. Her teammates and coaches winced at every call against her: Jones led her team in scoring in three games of the series, and it was clear that the Sun would need her.
By the middle of the third quarter, the Sun had built a 9-point lead, but then Jones received a fourth personal foul on a layup by Delle Donne. Brionna Jones subbed in for Jonquel Jones, but Mystics forward Emma Meesseman checked in, too — and right on time. Meesseman was critical to the Mystics’ plans in case Delle Donne was unable to suit up in Game 5, but her presence proved crucial even with Delle Donne on the court. After Jonquel Jones’s departure, mismatches gave Meesseman a clear path to draw fouls and rack up easy buckets. She finished the night with 22 points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals — and the title of Finals MVP.
Jonquel Jones returned in the fourth quarter, but the damage had already been done. Delle Donne, Meesseman, and the entire Mystics squad kicked their game into high gear. With an assist from Meesseman, Natasha Cloud made an epic 26-foot 3-point jumper to tie the game at 70 — and the Mystics never trailed the rest of the game.
Washington’s shooting game was the envy of the WNBA all season — particularly at the foul line — and Game 5 was no different. After ranking No. 1 during the regular season with a free-throw percentage of 87.5, the Finals champs shot 79.2 percent from the line in Game 5.
The remaining six minutes were filled with pure hustle by both teams. But the Sun were unable to convert their passion into enough points to steal the game. Meesseman and Delle Donne each scored jumpshots, and Kristi Toliver closed out the game with some crisp free throws. As the game clock ticked down to zero, players embraced one another on the sideline and on the court.
Delle Donne played 37 minutes in Game 5 despite her injuries. The league MVP racked up 21 points, nine rebounds, two assists and one steal.
“Have I told you lately that I love you?” said an emotional Delle Donne to her coach, Mike Thibault. Delle Donne told reporter Holly Rowe after the game that she has said this to Thibault throughout the playoffs. Though Thibault is the winningest coach in WNBA history, this was his first WNBA Finals win. “A lot of people questioned why I went to a team that hadn’t been to the playoffs in a while,” Delle Donne said, “and I saw it with coach, I knew he was building something really special.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Even the Tampa Bay Rays extended their plucky season by pushing the Houston Astros to the brink of elimination, before losing Game 5. All that chaos has left the National League in particular with a championship-series matchup (Cardinals-Nationals) that was tough to see coming just a week and a half ago.
But after the division-series dust settled, the powerhouse Yankees and Astros are the teams left standing in the American League. In addition to being one of the best league championship series matchups ever on paper, it’s the titanic showdown that baseball fans have been anticipating all year — literally so.
As of Thursday night’s ALDS clincher in Houston, the Astros and Yankees rank Nos. 1 and 2 among remaining teams in FiveThirtyEight’s Elo ratings, 3 points of Elo apart from each other but 18 points clear of the other two contenders. They are also the two most likely champions left in the field, with a combined 65 percent chance that the winner of the ALCS will also win the title. In many ways, Yankees-Astros will be this year’s de facto World Series.
If we look at the harmonic mean of preseries Elo ratings for Houston (1590) and New York (1587),1 this year’s ALCS is the second-most impressive league championship series matchup in the entire history of baseball (or, at least, since the LCS began in 1969). The only LCS with a better matchup on paper was last year’s ALCS between the Boston Red Sox — who were in the midst of a historic season — and the Astros:

Baseball has been trending toward more superteams for a while now, so it’s not overly surprising that the past two seasons have seen the top two LCS matchups ever. In fact, according to Elo, the American League since 2017 has played host to three of history’s nine best LCS showdowns — and the Astros have been involved in all of them (winning in 2017, losing in 2018 and … well, we don’t know yet in 2019).
But perhaps more noteworthy about this year’s ALCS is simply how long baseball has had to keep an eye on this particular matchup. Although some other AL teams had great years — including the Twins, Rays and A’s, all of whom won at least 96 ballgames — the Astros and Yankees stood out as the cream of the league’s crop for essentially the entire season. There wasn’t a single week during the regular season that Houston and New York were not the AL’s top two teams according to our Elo ratings:
Yep, in the 26 weeks of the regular season, the Yankees and Astros topped the AL … 26 times. Then they eventually met up in the ALCS. That’s only the second time in history (again, since 1969) that two teams ranked 1-2 in their league every single week of the regular season, then ended up meeting in the league championship series:

The only other LCS in which both teams finished every week of the regular season as Nos. 1 and 2 in league Elo came in 1970, when the Baltimore Orioles and Minnesota Twins dominated their respective divisions all season long, putting themselves on an ALCS collision course. The Orioles ended up sweeping that one, but they also went into the series with a sizable 49-point Elo edge over Minnesota despite the two teams’ favorite status being solidified for so much of the season.
The Astros, by contrast, lead the Yankees by only 3 points of Elo right now, and New York is much better rested after sweeping the Twins in the ALDS. We still give the Astros an edge, with a 54 percent probability of going to the World Series, but there’s every chance this terrific on-paper battle lives up to the hype that’s been building up every single week of the entire season.

Yet today, 16 states plus the District of Columbia have enacted (though in several cases, not yet implemented) some version of AVR. Almost overnight, it has become a core part of the agenda for those who want to make it easier for more people to vote. This year alone, AVR bills have been introduced in 39 states.1 Where they can’t convince the legislature, AVR advocates sometimes take their case to the people — Alaska, Michigan and Nevada have all enacted the policy via ballot measure. And someday, AVR could become a national mandate: It was a centerpiece of H.R. 1, the voting-rights bill passed earlier this year by the newly Democratically controlled U.S. House of Representatives.
AVR is meant to help people register to vote without needing to remember to do so — states just automatically register eligible citizens whenever they first interact with a government agency, usually the Department of Motor Vehicles, though some states include other agencies as well. Say you’re in California and you’re renewing your driver’s license. Unless you opt out, you’re going to be on a voter roll by the time you leave the DMV. AVR proponents say this can inject thousands of new voters into the electorate and help achieve near-universal voter registration.
That logic assumes, though, that being unregistered is the main thing that stops some people from voting. There’s another option: that unregistered people are mostly those who were never going to vote anyway. If that’s the case, turnout wouldn’t change much no matter how many more people got registered.
To find out whether states that automatically register voters saw an increase in electoral participation, FiveThirtyEight collected registration and turnout statistics from all eight jurisdictions that implemented AVR in time for the 2018 general election (Alaska, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont). To our knowledge, this is the first time this data has been made public for multiple states, and therefore the first opportunity to see how registration trends changed.
Our analysis shows that people who were registered through AVR do vote — but not necessarily at the same rate as those who register themselves. Let’s run through the numbers:
From the day they first implemented AVR through their 2018 voter-registration deadline,2 those eight places automatically registered around 2.2 million new voters. (Although, as we’ll talk about in a minute, some of those voters surely would have registered without AVR.)
As many as 6 million existing voters who interacted with a government agency had their voter registrations automatically updated — for example, by replacing an outdated address.3

In the four jurisdictions that reported turnout among the newly registered voters, between 42 percent and 54 percent of them cast a ballot in 2018.4 Voters who registered through a means other than AVR turned out at rates between 46 percent and 76 percent in these places, though some of these people did have their registrations updated through AVR.
In Colorado, Oregon and Vermont, overall turnout was significantly higher than turnout among people who were registered automatically, which means people who registered themselves were much more likely to vote. However, in Rhode Island, the AVR and overall turnout rates were about the same. And in the District of Columbia, turnout was actually higher among those who had been automatically registered than among the general population.

Now for the caveats. A kind of statistical counterfactual haunts these numbers: We can’t know how many of these voters would have registered (or updated their registrations) without AVR. For one thing, new eligible voters are created every day as people turn 18 or become citizens, and many of them could be captured by AVR before they get around to registering themselves to vote. And even those who were previously eligible might have added themselves to the rolls without AVR. Take, for example, someone who just moved to Colorado or a past nonvoter who’s fired up about the 2020 race: They both may have planned to register themselves but the DMV got to them first. And it’s possible that AVR registrants who would have registered even without AVR wound up turning out at higher rates than those who wouldn’t have registered otherwise, which would drive up turnout numbers for the whole group.
But based on what we do know, AVR appears to deserve at least some of the credit for this boost in civic participation. For example, according to Colorado state election officials, the state saw a big increase in the number of people registering to vote at the DMV after spring 2017, which they attribute to the implementation of AVR. A report by the Brennan Center for Justice, an advocacy group that supports AVR (among a number of other causes), found that AVR was directly responsible for increased registration rates in several states. And then there’s the behavioral economics of it all. Reed College professor Paul Gronke told FiveThirtyEight that social science research has generally found that an opt-out system (like AVR) is more effective than an opt-in one (like having to actively register yourself).
The story, though, doesn’t end there. Each state implements AVR a little — and sometimes a lot — differently. What makes the system work better in some places than in others? It’s a big question for voting-rights advocates as they push to export the most effective versions of AVR to even more states.
How to register as many voters as possible
On March 16, 2015, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown made history by signing the nation’s first AVR law — and also, apparently, one of the most successful. According to our data, Oregon registered the most voters per capita per day5 of any jurisdiction in our sample. The state has gone from 73 percent of eligible voters being registered at the time of the 2014 election to 90 percent for the 2018 election.
Oregon’s success may be at least partly credited to the fact that AVR registrants are given the option to opt out not at the DMV, but in a notice mailed to them after the fact6; voters have 21 days to return the notice and cancel their registration. By contrast, most other states ask people if they want to opt out at the time of the transaction itself.
This kind of delayed system is controversial. Many AVR supporters prefer the back-end system — where voters are sent an opt-out notice after their transaction is over — because they believe it results in more registrations. Jeanne Atkins, who was secretary of state when AVR first passed in Oregon, said that a system like Oregon’s also minimizes the burden on DMV employees, who would otherwise have to walk voters through more of the registration process.
But others, such as election-law expert Christy McCormick, prefer a front-end system — where voters are asked if they want to opt out at the time of the transaction — because it puts the agency in voters’ hands. For example, what if an Oregonian wants to purposely stay unregistered for political or religious reasons? He might miss the mailing and get registered against his will. For some people, automatic registration could even be a safety issue. Voter registration records (including home addresses) are public information in some states (including Oregon), and although Oregonians can apply to keep their information confidential, someone who gets registered without realizing it and then misses the opt-out notice might not know that their address was publicly available — which could be dangerous for victims of stalking or those escaping domestic violence.
But registering voters is only half the battle. Oregon’s system hasn’t translated to a high number of new votes. Only 42 percent of automatically registered Oregonians turned out in the 2018 election — well below the 70 percent of all Oregon registered voters who returned a ballot. That means Oregon was either the worst or second-worst jurisdiction of the five we examined at converting new registrants into voters.7 Oregon struggled with this in 2016, too: 47 percent (118,494 out of 251,209) of automatically registered voters that year cast a valid ballot,8 whereas 80 percent of all registered voters did.
It’s easy to venture a guess about why the numbers are low: By definition, AVR-registered voters are those who were previously unregistered, suggesting many aren’t all that interested in politics, or at least aren’t already in the habit of voting. But not all places have such low AVR turnout rates.
How to get new voters to turn out
In the District of Columbia, only 46 percent of all registered voters turned out in 2018, but 54 percent of automatically registered voters did. And in Rhode Island, the difference between the overall turnout rate and the AVR turnout rate was less than a percentage point. What did these places do differently?
Councilmember Charles Allen, who introduced D.C.’s AVR law, credits the city’s high AVR turnout rate to the fact that the district sends postcards to every registered voter just before an election to remind them to vote. And in Rhode Island, a DMV employee verbally asks customers if they want to opt out, which Atkins theorized may make those who don’t opt out more likely to know they are registered — and therefore more likely to vote — than under a system like Oregon’s.
However, AVR advocate and progressive activist Sean McElwee disagreed that a one-time bureaucratic interaction is enough to get someone politically engaged; he believes campaigns are the best way to activate voters. Indeed, one way that AVR can actually lead to higher turnout is that automatically registered voters’ data is more up to date, making it easier to contact them and urge them to vote. Thus, AVR turnout may be a better measure of how successful campaigns were at targeting the pool of automatic registrants than how successful the government’s implementation of AVR was.
It could also be that D.C. and Rhode Island just got lucky. Other states with front-end opt-outs (notably, Colorado and Vermont) did not see high AVR turnout rates,9 and most AVR jurisdictions mail new registrants something — either an opt-out form or a simple reminder — saying that they are now registered (though they do it immediately after the transaction, not necessarily right before the election).
To that point, Whitney Quesenbery, the co-director of the Center for Civic Design, an organization that consults on the usability of forms and systems related to the voting process, offered one last theory for D.C. and Rhode Island’s high turnout rates: Both places rolled out AVR during the summer of 2018. That means that everyone who was automatically registered in those jurisdictions went through the process within a few months of the election. Accordingly, all new voters there received two or three reminders of their registration status in the thick of campaign season — first, when they registered at a government agency; second, when they received confirmation of their registration in the mail; and, in D.C., third, when they received the usual pre-election postcard.
What’s the data not telling us?
Most of these numbers tell the story of AVR’s successes, but not its failures. California stands as a cautionary tale of how AVR can create serious problems when government agencies are incompetent or unprepared. There, the legislature dropped AVR in the lap of an understaffed, overcrowded DMV with an outdated computer system the department described as “a 40-year-old dinosaur,” and the state rushed to get AVR in place before the June 2018 primary. Not surprisingly, the rollout was a mess, exposing the system to foreign hackers, glitching out on users and failing to register some people in time to vote. Users complained that the interface was confusing, and DMV employees were not properly trained to answer their questions.
An audit found that the system created nearly 84,000 duplicate voter registrations in its first five months, which county election officials had to laboriously fix one at a time. More than 171,000 people were not registered with the political party they should have been. Worse, the system introduced inaccuracies into 23,000 people’s voter records, including 4,600 people who opted out but were registered anyway. Most seriously, the state admitted in October 2018 that employees making sloppy data entries had wrongly registered an additional 1,500 people — including at least a few noncitizens.
“While California’s system design and rollout was particularly mismanaged, it demonstrates the problems that [AVR] risks generating,” Lisa Dixon, the publications director for Lawyers Democracy Fund, an election-integrity advocacy group that’s opposed to AVR, wrote in an email to FiveThirtyEight. Basically, any time you give more agencies access to the voter database, more agencies could screw it up. And in addition to the California fiasco, Lawyers Democracy Fund says there are plenty of other reasons to oppose AVR. For one, it can bloat the voter-registration rolls, which can slow down voter processing and make for longer lines at polling places. (Although it’s worth noting that having inaccurate or out-of-date voter records, which AVR can help remedy, also creates problems at polling places.)


Automatic voter registration began as a way to get more voters on the rolls — and the data we have so far suggests it has succeeded. However, we should be careful not to overstate the case for AVR. Doubtlessly, at least some of the people who registered and voted under AVR would have done so in its absence. And there are still valid reasons to oppose AVR, as it can cause serious problems in addition to its benefits.
And in their own ways, both sides of the debate agree that AVR is not a cure-all for the problem of low turnout. As our data shows, many people who were automatically registered still did not vote in the 2018 election. Organizations like campaigns still have to finish the job.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

In the Louisiana gubernatorial race, a Republican victory would mean total GOP control of the state government; similarly, in Virginia, Democrats could take total control with just a few more legislative victories.
And which party wins could have big consequences for state policy. Take the Kentucky gubernatorial race as an example. There, Andy Beshear, the Democratic nominee, has claimed that if Republican Gov. Matt Bevin wins reelection, his cuts to the education budget will be so drastic that some of the last remaining schools in rural communities across the state will close. At the same time, Bevin has argued that Beshear holds radical views on health care — like opposing a work requirement for some Medicaid recipients — and that if Beshear is elected, he’ll continue to support the “government takeover of health care.”
But how high are the stakes exactly? Based on the campaign rhetoric, you might expect state spending to be fundamentally transformed by whichever party is in control. The real-world effects, however, are more limited.
One way we can answer this question is to look at what’s happened in state governments over the last 30 years, as Republicans have been on quite an electoral run. The GOP went from full control in only three state governments in 1992 to 26 in 2018. Democrats have had full control of some state governments during this time period too — including some gains in the midterm elections last year — but their control has been nowhere as extensive as the GOP’s. Government at the state level is seen as a story of conservative success; Republicans gained ground nationwide in elections and built networks of advocacy groups, associations and think tanks — all while becoming increasingly conservative.
But in my new book, “Red State Blues: How the Conservative Revolution Stalled in the States,” I argue that states controlled by Republicans haven’t shifted the size of government as much as one might have expected. In reviewing the programs that were (and were not) implemented, I found that policy either continued to move to the left or it stabilized, rather than moving in a more conservative direction.
One simple indicator I looked at is state expenditures. Despite Republican gains at the state level, states have still been spending a lot more money over time. Even as more Republicans took control since the 1990s, median spending by states doubled (adjusted for inflation).
There were some shifts in spending during this time period, but those often had more to do with economic conditions than with the party that controlled the state government. I also found that most state spending was focused on what are largely thought of as Democratic priorities — health care, education, and social services. And that paying for those services often meant higher taxes and fees, too. State spending has also risen as a share of state economic activity, though more slowly, and state workforces grew steadily until the 2000s.
This, of course, does not sound like what Republican governors and legislators typically promise on the campaign trail, but Republican control of state governments did have some effects. I found that Republican control meant slightly less growth in government as a share of a state’s economy. But it took many years to see these effects and it was not enough to reverse the nationwide upward trend.
So why hasn’t the GOP been more successful in curtailing states’ spending?
One potential explanation is that by the time Republicans took control, states were already on the hook for providing public services that were popular and therefore hard to roll back. GOP officials also faced powerful headwinds: The federal government often required or incentivized new state spending, and legislative staff, state agencies and interest groups frequently fought to maintain funding.
Moreover, not all policy trends are partisan. States move together in some areas as evidence accumulates or opinions shift, regardless of the direction the political winds are blowing. Most states, for instance, have expanded pre-kindergarten education and promoted renewable energy. And states have largely reversed course on strict prison sentences and outlawing gay marriage.
Republicans’ control of state governments did have significant effects beyond spending. Republicans were especially effective at passing legislation across multiple states on social issues like education, abortion and guns. And Republicans have limited some important extensions of government services, despite not reducing state spending over time. Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act offers a good example. Fourteen largely Republican-controlled states have still not expanded Medicaid, despite a good deal of available financial support from the federal government. That’s a real effect with real consequences. Of course, another way to look at this is that 36 states nearly doubled the size of their largest program despite many being controlled by Republicans.
It isn’t that these policies don’t have important ramifications — they often do. But whether a state was controlled by Republicans or Democrats didn’t produce large shifts in indicators like economic growth, inequality, family structure or crime. Red and blue states differ, but not necessarily because their policies transform state economies or societies.
Elections do matter. Voters this November will have a hand in helping decide their state’s policy direction. And as states become increasingly tied to one party, voters’ partisan choices can have an outsized effect on states’ policy agendas.
But we should not expect instant and fundamental change. Even though the two parties often present voters with near-opposite agendas, like with Beshear and Bevin in Kentucky, once they’re in power, the two parties tend to move policy only marginally in the direction they want and the effects of those policy changes are often smaller than anticipated. Republicans’ increased political power did not reverse either the size or scope of state government through the 1990s and 2000s. So while voters should see some impact from their choices at the ballot box this November, it’s still not as much as the campaign ads imply.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

75,000 Amish people
One group that may be a surprise factor in the 2020 election in Pennsylvania: its 75,000 Amish residents. Republican operatives Ben Walters and Ben King have started “Amish PAC” to convince the intensely private, technology-avoiding demographic to vote for Trump in the next election. Amish values are closely aligned with Republican ones, such as opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage, but areas like Lancaster County had extremely low voter turnout from its Amish residents — approximately 1 in 15 eligible voters cast a ballot in 2016.

2.4 million California residents
At midnight on Wednesday, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) started to shutdown power in Northern and Central California, with approximately 500,000 customers cut off by the middle of the day. The fear is that faulty power lines will start fires; the company cited “forecasts of dry, hot and windy weather, including potential fire risk” — conditions that are expected to last until at least Thursday morning. The shutdown has led to residents purchasing large amounts of water, gas, food and other emergency supplies. [BuzzFeed News]
$22 billion in fishing subsidies
Despite growing concerns about the decline of global fish stocks, ocean-faring nations spent $22 billion in 2018 on subsidies that promote illegal and overfishing, according to new research published in Marine Policy by scientists at the University of British Columbia. The survey, which covered 152 countries, also found that harmful subsidies accounted for 63 percent of the total spent on supporting the global fishing industry. [National Geographic]
82,000 animal fragments
The Qesem Cave in central Israel was sealed for hundreds of thousands of years, but a new study from archaeologist Ran Barkai and his colleagues suggests it may have been an old meat locker. An analysis of nearly 82,000 animal fragments showed “unusual, heavy chop marks on the ends of some leg bones” made by the Paleolithic people. Researchers found that odd (for complicated reasons), and came to the hypothesis that the cave’s inhabitants saved animal bones filled with marrow as a future food source. Barkai and his team reconstructed similar conditions to test their theory, and found both the chop marks they were looking for and that the marrow inside the deer bones was still nutritious nine weeks later.

49.2 percent support
Two weeks after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, FiveThirtyEight’s impeachment polling tracker shows support for impeachment has moved from 40.1 percent to a near-majority opinion. It’s up to 49.2 percent, as of early Thursday. And it isn’t just a growing sentiment among Democrats: preliminary polling results also found support for impeachment rising among independents and Republicans, too. [FiveThirtyEight]
$3,499.55 for a claw-shaped Cheeto
You can browse millions of different items for sale on eBay, the global online flea market, including hundreds of Cheetos shaped like stuff. Tove Danovich reports on the high-priced cultural phenomenon, which includes Cheetos shaped like a fluffy baby penguin ($849.99), a ray gun ($607) and Mr. Crab’s claw ($3,499.55).

We started with Elo ratings before introducing our CARMELO player projection system, which we then incorporated into our “CARM-Elo” season prediction model. We tested and tweaked the prediction model over the years, but it was always powered by metrics from other sources, such as Box Plus/Minus (BPM) and Real Plus-Minus (RPM).
But that changes this year. RAPTOR, which stands for Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings, is FiveThirtyEight’s new NBA statistic. We’re pretty excited about it. In addition to being a statistic that we bake in house, RAPTOR fulfills two long-standing goals of ours:
First, we wanted to create a publicly available statistic that takes advantage of modern NBA data, specifically player tracking and play-by-play data that isn’t available in traditional box scores.
Second, and relatedly, we wanted a statistic that better reflects how modern NBA teams actually evaluate players.
NBA teams highly value floor spacing, defense and shot creation, and they place relatively little value on traditional big-man skills. RAPTOR likewise values these things — not because we made any deliberate attempt to design the system that way but because the importance of those skills emerges naturally from the data. RAPTOR thinks ball-dominant players such as James Harden and Steph Curry are phenomenally good. It highly values two-way wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It can have a love-hate relationship with centers, who are sometimes overvalued in other statistical systems. But it appreciates modern centers such as Nikola Jokić and Joel Embiid, as well as defensive stalwarts like Rudy Gobert.

For a much deeper and more technical description, you can find our methodological explainer here. But these are the highlights:
Like BPM and RPM, RAPTOR is a plus-minus statistic that measures the number of points a player contributes to his team’s offense and defense per 100 possessions, relative to a league-average player. For instance, a player with an offensive RAPTOR rating of +2.1 boosts his team’s performance by 2.1 points per 100 offensive possessions while he is on the floor. Likewise, a player with a defensive RAPTOR of +3.4 would improve his team’s defensive performance1 by 3.4 points per 100 possessions while he’s on the court.
Plus-minus statistics have certain inherent limitations, and RAPTOR is subject to those, too. Namely, these statistics assume that player performance is largely linear and additive, that is, that you can roughly add up the ratings from individual players to project team performance. In other words, RAPTOR does not account for coaching, systems or synergies between teammates.
RAPTOR consists of two major components that are blended together to rate players: a “box” (as in “box score”) component, which uses individual statistics (including statistics derived from player tracking and play-by-play data), and an “on-off” component, which evaluates a team’s performance when the player and various combinations of his teammates are on or off the floor.
The variables included in “box” RAPTOR were chosen by evaluating how they did in predicting long-term RAPM (real adjusted plus-minus), which is a measure of how a team’s performance changes when the player is on and off the floor. Essentially, this is the same technique that BPM used, only RAPTOR uses play-by-play and player tracking statistics in addition to traditional ones. On offense, for instance, in addition to using traditional statistics like points, RAPTOR accounts for factors such as how many of a player’s field goals were assisted and how valuable these assists were,2 the value of different types of offensive rebounds, time of possession and various measures of floor spacing, such as the number of contested 3-pointers that the player took. On defense, it looks at factors like how often the player was the nearest defender on an opponents’ shot and how often those shots went in,3 how many points and rebounds were scored by opponents at the defender’s position, and how often the player induced offensive fouls.
The “on-off” element of RAPTOR evaluates how a player’s team performed while he was on the floor, how the player’s courtmates (the teammates that the player most often shared the court with) performed while they were on the floor without the player, and, finally, how those courtmates’ other courtmates performed when they were on the floor without the player’s courtmates, all adjusted for the strength of competition they were facing. We know it might sound a little goofy. But it’s relatively simple to calculate. And it correlates very well with RAPM, while stabilizing a lot faster than RAPM, which can take years’ worth of data to estimate reliably.
Overall, however, RAPTOR weights the “box” component more highly than the “on-off” component. In testing RAPTOR on out-of-sample data, we found that while on-court/off-court stats provide useful information, they’re nonetheless quite noisy as compared with individual measures of player value that are used in the “box” part of RAPTOR.
When applied to past data — for instance, in evaluating who the best players were in the 2018-19 season — RAPTOR is a descriptive statistic. Descriptive RAPTOR is based solely on a player’s on-court performance and the performance of the player’s teammates, as described above. It does not use priors based on a player’s height, weight, age or any other factor.
However, RAPTOR can also be used to make team and player predictions, and indeed our NBA predictions are now fueled by RAPTOR. (We are retiring the CARMELO brand name from our previous projection system, although much of the code for RAPTOR projections is borrowed from CARMELO.) RAPTOR-driven predictions do use qualities such as height, age and draft position, and even whether a player recently appeared on an All-NBA team — that data improves the performance of the predictive measure. Predictions also weight variables slightly differently than descriptive RAPTOR does, as certain statistics are more subject to luck than others. We refer to this predictive version of RAPTOR as PREDATOR (PREDictive rApTOR).
RAPTOR is based exclusively on publicly available data. There are other player-tracking statistics we believe could be highly helpful to RAPTOR, especially more detailed measures of on-ball defense, so we hope to be able to revisit RAPTOR as additional data becomes available.
RAPTOR’s name (in addition to being a whimsical backronym in the tradition of CARMELO and DRAYMOND) honors the 2018-19 Toronto Raptors, which FiveThirtyEight’s previous projection system correctly predicted had an edge over the Golden State Warriors (even though we didn’t fully believe the projection ourselves at the time).
The full-fledged version of RAPTOR is available for the 2013-14 season onward, as that’s when the NBA’s player-tracking data came on line. We also have a historical version of RAPTOR called Approximate RAPTOR dating back to 1976-1977, the first season after the ABA-NBA merger, but that uses a far more limited range of data.
RAPTOR ratings for players with at least 1,000 minutes played4 in a season since 2013-14 can be found in the table below. As you can see, RAPTOR generally loves perimeter players and wings, such as Curry, Harden, Leonard and Chris Paul, although some frontcourt players like Jokic, Anthony Davis and Draymond Green are also rated highly by the system. For more detail on past RAPTORs, including the breakdown of box and on-off components, you can download files that list the regular season and playoffs separately, or a version that combines a player’s appearances over the course of the entire season5 into one file.

I describe RAPTOR in more detail in the methodology post. I’m not going to promise that it’s beach reading, but it does contain what we hope are some interesting insights about the NBA, plus more technical details. Also, thanks to Ryan Davis, Steve Ilardi, Ben Taylor, Seth Partnow, Charles Rolph and Evan Wasch for their advice and assistance on RAPTOR.
We’ll have more ways for readers to see and use RAPTOR soon. But for now, we’re excited to get your feedback, start the season, and put our metric to the test.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/joe-burrow-is-leading-lsus-almost-unrecognizable-offense/,2019-10-10,,,features,"Oct. 10, 2019",Joe Burrow Is Leading LSU’s Almost Unrecognizable Offense,Josh Planos,FiveThirtyEight,College Football,"LSU quarterback Joe Burrow is in the midst of one of the most prolific starts to a season by a player at his position in program history. His celebrity has ascended to such heights that when the Tigers visited Austin earlier this season, Texas Longhorn fans fired a cannon through his jersey.1
The senior — the outsider with the James Dean aura, close-cropped hairdo and swagger of a ruthless pageant queen — has electrified a long-dormant LSU offense infamous for misbegotten schemes, an unwillingness to adapt to the times and an inability to uphold its end of the bargain. There’s a generation of college football fans who know LSU’s offense to be more house cat than apex predator, who associate the Tiger defense with a tourniquet trotted out to save their listless brethren. Under former head coach Les Miles, the Tiger offense had routinely underperformed relative to its 5-star talent.2
But this season, head coach Ed Orgeron’s pregame tradition of punching himself repeatedly in the face is apparently paying off. The Tigers are undefeated and firmly in the College Football Playoff picture, with a 23 percent likelihood of reaching it, according to the FiveThirtyEight model.3 And much of their successful start is attributable to Burrow and the offense: LSU is tied for the best red-zone scoring attack, and it outright leads the nation in scoring and third-down success rate. More generally, the offense is tearing opponents to pieces.
A two-season backup at Ohio State,4 Burrow didn’t garner much Heisman attention this summer. And now? Less than halfway through the regular season, he is rewriting the school record book5 and is well on his way to being one of the first quarterbacks called at this year’s NFL draft. When his transfer was announced, the Bayou asked him to be its savior. Who could argue that he hasn’t delivered?

Orgeron had known that he needed to retool his offense, and he didn’t have to look far to find a solution. Prior to this season, the gravel-voiced head coach hired Joe Brady from the New Orleans Saints and installed the 30-year-old as his passing game coordinator.
Welcome to the “shotgunification” of the LSU offense, a process that started a few seasons ago and one that the new coordinator has only continued, albeit with some notable differences. Brady’s spread principles largely draw from run-pass options and three-receiver sets, and he favors disguising packages and a faster tempo that led the Tigers’ huddle rate to drop by nearly 50 percentage points from last season.

Burrow has been given free rein to let it fly, especially on first down. This is, of course, not the way things are traditionally done in Louisiana. From 2004 to 2018, the Tigers ranked 112th among 120 FBS schools in first-down pass percentage (35.4 percent). This season, they rank eighth.
And this systematic overhaul has proven fruitful. This season, only Oklahoma and Alabama are averaging more points per drive this year than LSU’s 3.87 — a remarkable achievement, given that LSU failed to crack the top 25 in that measure from 2014 to 2018. Over the past 10 seasons, LSU quarterbacks produced 2.09 expected points added on pass attempts per game, a mark that ranked 53rd nationally and ninth among teams currently in the SEC. This season, they’re producing 21.4, the third-best mark nationally.
And Burrow is the man engineering that success. Through five games, he’s averaging 372.8 passing yards per game, a full 14.4 yards better than any other SEC QB at this point in the season since at least 2004.
His throws are also typically right where they need to be. Burrow leads the nation in completion percentage (78.4). And when you adjust for throw aways and drops, only four QBs since 2011 posted a higher completion percentage through five games than Burrow’s 83.9. Two of those quarterbacks (Baker Mayfield and Robert Griffin III) won the Heisman in that given season.
When pressured by the defense, Burrow is completing better than 70 percent of his passes, whereas the national average is 44 percent. And under game pressure, Burrow is also unfazed: He is completing 83.3 percent of his passes in one-possession games. His ability to handle both was on display during this touchdown pass — in the fourth quarter of LSU’s win over Texas.

The unanticipated rise of Burrow has the Tigers offense — and national media outlets — buzzing. Michael Bonnette, LSU’s communications director, told me in an email that in his 20 years at the job, only once had he fielded more interview requests from national outlets for a player at this point in the season.6
Historically, the offensive side of the ball — and particularly the quarterback position — hasn’t been kind to the Tigers.7 Excitement in Death Valley will reach a fever pitch if Burrow can lead the Tigers past a brutal upcoming four-week slate that includes matchups with Florida, Auburn and Alabama. If the quarterback can keep it up, his jersey may be too valuable for opposing fans to destroy.

The Red River Shootout is usually a game to circle on the college football calendar, but it’s seldom been bigger than in recent years. Last season’s version8 was an instant classic, with Oklahoma staging a furious comeback from down 21 in the fourth quarter, only to leave too much time on the clock for Longhorns QB Sam Ehlinger to drive into range for a game-winning field goal with seconds left. Although the Sooners no longer have Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray, they haven’t skipped a beat with Jalen Hurts as his replacement. Although Texas’s playoff odds were hurt by their Week 2 loss against LSU, they still have a 5 percent chance now — and a great chance to play spoiler against the Sooners, whose playoff probability would fall from 46 percent to 22 percent with a loss here. Our model gives OU a 72 percent chance of surviving, which would bolster their playoffs odds to 56 percent. But according to our Elo ratings, the Longhorns are the toughest team the Sooners have faced — or will face — during this whole regular season.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-gerrit-cole-went-from-so-so-to-unhittable/,2019-10-10,,,features,"Oct. 10, 2019",How Gerrit Cole Went From So-So To Unhittable,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"Gerrit Cole was always supposed to make hitters swing and miss. But there was a time when the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 draft, with a 100 mph fastball in his arsenal, failed to meet expectations.
In his five years with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cole hovered around average in strikeout performance. By FanGraphs’ strikeout rate “plus” (K%+) metric, which sets the strikeout ability baseline at 100 and adjusts for yearly strikeout environment, Cole’s first five years in the majors ranged from slightly below to slightly above average. Between 2013 and 2017, his K%+ rate fell between 91 and 118 percent.
But after the Houston Astros acquired Cole, his adjusted strikeout performance jumped to 156 in 2018, meaning he was 56 percent above the major league average. This year? His 176 mark is the best adjusted performance since Erik Bedard’s 2007 season. By raw totals, Cole’s 326 total strikeouts this season are the 14th most in a single season and the most since Randy Johnson’s 334 in 2002. He has continued to dominate into October, and will pitch in an elimination Game 5 on Thursday versus Tampa Bay.
So how did Cole go from being an unexceptional strikeout pitcher to the game’s best K artist, and perhaps a favorite to win the AL Cy Young Award? It’s a story about his fastball, a pitch that has transformed from a middling offering to the game’s best, according to FanGraphs run values.
“He’s essentially throwing laser beams, or as close to it as I’ve ever seen from a human,” said one MLB front office official.
The game has changed since Cole debuted in 2013. Back then, the Pirates were teaching pitchers to pitch to contact and were producing record ground-ball rates. But strikeouts have the benefit of keeping the ball out of play and out of the air, and those qualities have become more and more important as home run levels have risen and risen.
When the Astros sat Cole down for a meeting in February 2018, they outlined how they believed Cole could be a more dominant pitcher. Aided by heat maps, data and video, team officials explained that much of their plan was dependent upon Cole’s fastball.
The Astros showed Cole that his upper-90s, four-seam fastball was harder to hit up in the zone. They recommended that he scrap his two-seam fastball, typically thrown lower in the zone to try to create ground balls, and a pitch type that has been crushed recently.
He listened. Cole reduced the share of two-seam fastballs he threw — from 18.1 percent of offerings in 2017 to 0.4 percent this year — and targeted the upper portions of the strike zone, a move designed to stay above hitters’ swing planes.
Cole has generated 220 swings and misses on his fastball in the top third or above the strike zone this year, which is the most of the Statcast era. (Justin Verlander’s 185 last season is second.) In 2017, Cole produced 66.



Another enhancement to his fastball was more curious: his dramatic spike in spin rate, which created controversy last season. Spin is important because more spin (transverse spin specifically) increases the Magnus effect, thus creating more movement — a larger rise on a fastball or break on a curveball. Spin and velocity lead to more swing and misses. While spin rate generally increases with velocity, Cole’s velocity has increased only slightly in Houston. It’s thought to be difficult to change spin-to-velocity ratio without using foreign substance, and some people believe that the use of sticky substances is widespread in baseball.
When I asked Cole last summer about his change in spin rate, he explained that Verlander had taught him how to get more “true rotation and hop” on his fastball. He has raised his vertical release point, and the spin axis of his fastball has changed slightly from 222 degrees in 2017 to 216 degrees with the Astros.
In 2017, Cole’s fastball averaged 8.79 inches of vertical movement, ranking 191st out of 295 starting pitchers, according to BaseballProspectus.com PITCHf/x leaderboards. This year, Cole’s fastball had 9.95 inches of vertical movement, ranking 32nd among 395 starting pitchers. He’s gained an inch of “rise” and 1 mph on his fastball. That might not sound like a lot, but even small gains can have large effects.
In 2017, Cole’s fastball ranked 41st among qualifying pitchers1 in whiff-per-swing rate at 21.6 percent, and he finished with a 4.26 ERA on the season. In his first year in Houston, Cole’s four-seam, whiff-per-swing rate jumped to 12th, at 29.3 percent, and his ERA dropped to 2.88. And this season, he led the majors in four-seam fastball whiff rate (36.9 percent) and finished with a 2.50 ERA. Batters have hit .171 against his four-seam fastball. He can now dominate batters in the strike zone with his fastball, not just with his swing-and-miss slider below it.

Cole, a free-agent-to-be, could lead the Astros to a second title in three years thanks in part to arguably the best pitch in the majors: a fastball that has become a laser beam.

Riddler Express
This week’s Riddler Express was related to me by Sunil Singh, who heard it from Sam Vandervelde, who heard it from … well, let’s just say this puzzle has been circulating for a while and is ready for prime time!
An auditorium with 200 seats, numbered from 1 to 200, is filled to capacity. A speaker, who happens to be a mathematician, steps up to the podium overlooking the audience and pauses for a moment. “You know,” she says, “I’m thinking of a rather large whole number. Every seat number in this auditorium evenly divides my number, except for two of them — and those two seats happen to be next to each other.”
As you’d expect, adjacent seats in the auditorium have consecutive numbers. Which two numbers was the speaker referring to?

Riddler Classic
Last year, Riddler Nation tackled a puzzle from Mike Donner about wartime navigation. An enemy submarine determined to sink your ship was exactly halfway between you and your home port. Your ship had no further information about the submarine’s subsequent movement. The sub had to be directly underneath your ship to sink it, but the sub could track your moves with precision and respond efficiently. How much faster than the sub did your ship have to be to guarantee you could avoid the sub and get home?
It turned out your ship needed to be about 2.33 times faster than the sub. This is demonstrated by the animation below: The expanding pink circle is the region where the sub could be located after a given amount of time, and the blue curve represents your ship’s course around it.
This week, aware of your mathematical prowess, the enemy has deployed two submarines so that your ship, the submarines and the harbor you seek are evenly spaced along a straight line.
If both subs travel at the same speed, how much faster than the subs does your ship have to be to guarantee that you can avoid them and reach the harbor?
Extra Credit: Suppose there are N submarines evenly spaced between your ship and the harbor. How much faster than the subs must your ship be?

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏Ryan Potts 👏 of Newnan, Georgia, winner of last week’s Riddler Express.
Last week, you had made it to the final question in “Who Wants to Be a Riddler Millionaire?” Out of the four choices, A, B, C and D, you were 70 percent sure the answer was B, and the remaining choices looked equally implausible. You decided to use your final lifeline, the 50:50, which left you with two possible answers, one of them correct. Lo and behold, B remained an option! How confident were you then that B was the correct answer?
Once again, there was a fair bit of disagreement across Riddler Nation. Just over half of the more than 800 respondents were 87.5 percent sure that B was the correct answer. Meanwhile, a fifth of respondents were still 70 percent sure that B was the correct answer. The next most popular answers were 90 percent, 80 percent and 84 percent. Despite this disagreement over the exact confidence, I am proud to say that almost all of Riddler Nation recognized that the answer was at least 70 percent. If B remains an option, it can’t be less likely to be the correct answer. But how confident should you be — still 70 percent, 87.5 percent or something else?
Many readers who said your confidence should remain at 70 percent cited the famous Monty Hall problem as part of their reasoning. In that problem’s game show, there are three doors and you pick the one you think the prize is behind. Next, the host reveals a door that does not hold a prize. (Importantly, this will never be the door that you initially picked.) You are then asked whether you would like to stick with your door or switch to the remaining unopened door. Your initial probability of picking the right door was 1/3, and no matter which door you picked, the host can always reveal another door that lacks the prize. The probability that your original pick is correct has not changed. If you switch to the remaining door, you’ll win the prize two-thirds of the time, so switching is your best bet.
But there’s a key difference between the Monty Hall problem and last week’s Riddler Express: The answer you were leaning toward, choice B, could very well have been eliminated by the 50:50. In other words, the game show’s decision of which two options would be removed was independent of your preference for B. Meanwhile, in the Monty Hall problem, the door you chose was never eliminated from contention. It’s a subtle difference, but it has a profound effect on the answer.
Note that this puzzle may also differ slightly from the original “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,” where, according to solver Rob Moran (who was a contestant on the show), “…the [two] answers remaining in this situation are not the correct answer and a randomly selected wrong answer. They are the correct answer and the most likely incorrect answer.”
Solvers Liam Lloyd and Jason Ash both used Bayes’ Theorem to determine the answer. Thomas McGlynn, meanwhile, invoked a related approach, thinking about 100 parallel universes, where choice B was the correct answer in 70 of them. In these 70 universes, choice B would always remain after the 50:50 because it was the right answer. But what about the other 30 universes? Well, the correct choice would have to remain, while the three incorrect responses (including B) would each survive the 50:50 a third of the time, or in 10 universes each. So, of the 80 universes in which choice B remains after the 50:50, it’s the correct answer in 70 of them. That means the probability that B is correct is 70/80, or 87.5 percent.
The Monty Hall problem may be a classic, but sometimes it pays to stick with your gut.
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏Michael Branicky 👏 of Lawrence, Kansas, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic.
Last week’s puzzle asked how many people you needed in a room so that there were better-than-even odds that at least three of them had the same birthday.
This was a variation on the classic birthday problem, which asks how many people are needed so that at least two of them have the same birthday. One way to solve this is to first calculate the probability that they all have different birthdays. For example, suppose you had four people — let’s call them A, B, C and D — in a room, lined up against a wall. The probability that B’s birthday is different from A’s is 364/365, since B’s birthday could be any of the 364 days that are not A’s birthday. By the same logic, the probability that C’s birthday is different from both A’s and B’s is 363/365, and the probability that D’s birthday is different from the other three birthdays is 362/365. To find the probability that all four people have different birthdays, we can multiply these probabilities together, giving us (365×364×363×362)/365^4, or about 98.4 percent. That means the other 1.6 percent of the time, at least two of them will have the same birthday. Extending this reasoning to larger groups of people, it turns out that among 23 people, there’s a 50.7 percent chance that at least two of them will have the same birthday.
Unfortunately, in going from at least two people with the same birthday to at least three, the math gets a lot thornier. But Riddler Nation was not so easily intimidated. Approaches ranged from generating functions, which have indeed been used to tackle problems like this, to detailed combinatorics. As puzzle submitter Joel Lewis observed and as Hector Pefo has written, one must carefully count all possible cases where there are pairs — but not triples — of people with the same birthday. In fact, there’s a 51.1 percent chance that with 88 people in the room, at least three of them will have the same birthday. It’s certainly more than the 23 people from the two-birthday problem … but again, paradoxically, it’s a smaller number than you might expect.
Another way to solve this problem is with brute force and computer simulation. When 87 people were in the room, the chances of at least three people having the same birthday were awfully close to 50 percent, so many solvers had to run millions of simulations to figure out if that probability was just under or just over the mark. Meanwhile, Dogan Kazakli’s computer came close to burning a hole through his desk as it cranked out the probability curves for different groups of people and how many had the same birthday:


So this week's #538 Riddler Classic was the good old Birthday Problem with a twist: Find the probability of there being at least 3 people in a group with matching birthdays.Well, I went a little overboard and solved it for any number of matches. pic.twitter.com/n7sm6XAAkH
— Dogan Kazakli (@doganck) October 8, 2019

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-a-democrat-get-reelected-governor-in-louisiana/,2019-10-10,,,features,"Oct. 11, 2019",Can A Democrat Get Reelected Governor In Louisiana?,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2019 Governors Elections,"A lot of things are unusual about Louisiana’s governor election. There’s the timing (the election is tomorrow, Oct. 12 — a Saturday) and the rules (there may or may not be a second round of voting in November). But perhaps most unusual is the fact that a state as red as Louisiana already has a Democratic governor — and there’s a good chance he wins again.
For starters, Gov. John Bel Edwards is popular. In one recent poll, he had a +18 net approval rating (50 percent of Louisianans approved of his job performance and 32 percent disapproved) — a remarkable achievement for a Democrat in a state that is 17 points more Republican-leaning than the nation as a whole.1 That said, Louisiana does have a long history of centrist Democratic governors, and Edwards has taken a page right out of their book. He has carved a path down the political middle, earning the ire of national Democrats earlier this year when he signed a bill that bans abortions after fetal cardiac activity can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. But politically speaking, it was probably the right call in Louisiana: According to a 2018 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute, the state has the nation’s lowest share of people who think abortion should be legal in most or all cases. He has also worked with Republican state legislators to pass other major legislation during his first term, including a tax deal that stabilized the state’s shaky finances and a series of criminal-justice reform bills that helped end Louisiana’s run as the state with the nation’s highest incarceration rate. Accordingly, many local Republicans (most notably Senate President John Alario) are now even supporting him for reelection.
But thanks to Louisiana’s “jungle primary” system (whereby all candidates, regardless of party, run together in the same election), Edwards will face five challengers on Saturday. That said, only two of them are serious contenders: Rep. Ralph Abraham and construction magnate Eddie Rispone, both Republicans. Abraham started off the race as Edwards’s main Republican rival; back in April, 38 percent of voters supported Edwards, 23 percent supported Abraham and only 7 percent supported Rispone, according to pollster JMC Analytics. But since then, the independently wealthy Rispone has blanketed the state with TV ads, including one that attacked Abraham. As of Sept. 22, the end of the most recent filing period, Rispone has spent almost $10.5 million on the race (most of it his own money), and still has $2.7 million in the bank. By contrast, Abraham has had far fewer resources at his disposal, spending only $2.9 million so far and with less than $319,000 on hand. (Edwards has spent more money on his campaign than either of them, deploying more than $11 million and boasting $3.2 million on hand.) And Rispone is now in a virtual tie with Abraham in the polls — and maybe even a little ahead.

Source: Polls
Abraham’s campaign is still touting private polling numbers that are better for him, but the last non-internal poll that showed Abraham leading Rispone was conducted in mid-September. And while you can usually assume that internal polls are skewed in favor of their sponsor, even Abraham’s own polling numbers indicate that Rispone is surging. An Abraham internal poll from June had Abraham ahead of Rispone 34 percent to 8 percent; by late September, that lead had been cut to 2 percentage points.
Whether Abraham or Rispone gets more votes is important because the top two finishers in the jungle primary usually advance to a runoff election, which in this case would be held Nov. 16. But this election may not even require a runoff, because Edwards may very well win it in the first round. (If a candidate wins a majority — 50 percent plus one — in the jungle primary, no runoff is held.) Edwards has averaged 47 percent in polls so far this month, so he just needs high Democratic turnout or a few more people who are undecided to vote for him.
But the GOP has marshaled the cavalry in its effort to keep Edwards under 50 percent of the vote on Saturday. Outside groups, such as the Republican Governors Association, have been hammering Edwards with negative ads, centering in particular on Edwards’s hiring of an aide who was accused of sexual harassment. (The attack is potentially damaging enough that Edwards’s campaign recently released a response ad.) And last week, Vice President Mike Pence held a rally encouraging Louisianans to “elect a Republican to the statehouse” (the White House, however, is not taking sides between Abraham and Rispone). On Friday night, though, the big guns will come out, as President Trump will rally alongside Abraham and Rispone in Lake Charles. In past elections, Trump has taken credit for turning out the Republican base with his rallies, and in such a red state, it could very well help force a runoff. The bad news for Republicans? Edwards has led both Abraham and Rispone in every poll of the hypothetical runoff since June.
We’ll find out on Saturday night whether this race will continue for another month, and if so, who will be joining Edwards in the final showdown.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Lawrence Hogan, Sr., a Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, bought airtime on TV networks across his home state of Maryland. He had a big announcement to share: Hogan was the first Republican on the House Judiciary Committee to publicly say he would vote to impeach Nixon. It was just over two weeks before Nixon would announce his resignation, and the Judiciary Committee was poised to approve three articles of impeachment against the president — except nobody knew that yet.
Today, as another impeachment drama unfolds, it’s easy to see Republicans like Hogan, who were willing to break ranks with their party, as a fundamental difference between Watergate and today. And it’s true that Republicans are currently staying in President Trump’s corner. But while we tend to focus on the bipartisan rebellion that led to Nixon’s resignation, it’s also worth understanding how public opinion and the party eventually turned against the president.
Support for impeachment had grown slowly over the course of 1974, but there still wasn’t an overwhelming public consensus behind it until right before Nixon left office in early August. And Republican support for Nixon had remained mostly strong, even in the face of a scandal that consumed his second term. As the truth about the scope of Nixon’s misconduct emerged, though, impeachment became increasingly popular and the president lost even his most fervent defenders in Congress. Of course, there are many differences between the Nixon impeachment and the Democrats’ current inquiry, which is still in its early stages, and each impeachment investigation will unfold differently. But as today’s Republicans are scrutinized for signs that they might turn on Trump, it’s important to remember that even in Watergate, it took more than a year of investigation — and a lot of evidence against Nixon — to reach the point where Republicans like Hogan were voting for impeachment.
Impeachment wasn’t popular until right before Nixon resigned
When the House of Representatives voted in February 1974 to give the House Judiciary Committee subpoena power to investigate Nixon, it did not have the weight of public opinion behind it. According to a poll conducted by Gallup just days before the vote, only 38 percent of Americans were in favor of impeachment. And although a solid majority of Americans did eventually come to support impeachment, that moment didn’t arrive until quite late in the game.
But this didn’t mean the public wasn’t souring on Nixon as the Watergate scandal unfolded. After winning a sweeping victory in the 1972 election, the president began his second term with an approval rating around 60 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight’s tracker of presidential approval. Then that spring saw a stunning 30-point drop in Nixon’s support starting around when one of the people charged with breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters confessed to a judge that he and the other conspirators had been pressured to stay silent.
Support for Nixon continued to plunge throughout the long summer of 1973, while former White House lawyer John Dean testified in Senate hearings that the president had been involved in a cover-up of the burglary and a White House aide confirmed in closed-door testimony that Nixon had set up a secret White House taping system. And by the time of October’s Saturday Night Massacre — where Nixon ordered the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had been demanding those tapes, and the closing of the special prosecutor’s investigation — his approval rating had plunged to 27 percent, which is about where it stayed until Nixon resigned.
As Nixon’s approval ratings fell, support for impeachment was rising more gradually, reaching solid majority support by early August 1974. That was right in the midst of the crucial two-week period when the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to turn over the White House tapes, the House Judiciary Committee voted to approve three articles of impeachment and Nixon released the transcript of what became known as the “smoking gun” tape, which showed that he had helped orchestrate the cover-up. His support among his allies (who had included some conservative southern Democrats as well as Republicans) had already started to erode significantly, but it was the “smoking gun” tape that finally forced his resignation on August 8, before the House could vote on impeachment. At that point, the public was clearly behind impeachment, although a significant minority of Americans — including most Republicans — still didn’t think Nixon should be removed from office.
Most Republicans in Congress took a long time to break with Nixon
So why did it take most Republicans so long to break with Nixon? There was a growing bipartisan sense of alarm about his actions, especially in the wake of the Saturday Night Massacre, as a handful of Republicans in Congress called for Nixon’s resignation. Even some party leaders and staunch Nixon defenders, like Sen. Barry Goldwater, criticized the president’s handling of the scandal, although their rebukes still fell short of calling for impeachment. The House’s vote to formally open an impeachment inquiry in February 1974 was almost unanimous.
Republicans generally saw the inquiry as legitimate, but that didn’t mean they had lost faith in Nixon. “Many remained vocal in support of the president, saying he was innocent,” said Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University and the former director of the Nixon presidential library. “Others were more judicious, waiting for the evidence to come out.”
Eventually, several of the more moderate Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, including Hogan, were convinced by the evidence against Nixon and voted for at least one of the articles of impeachment in July 1974. As the chart below shows, three of the articles of impeachment passed with varying levels of support from Republicans and conservative Democrats, although a significant number of conservative Republicans remained in Nixon’s camp. The final two articles of impeachment, which centered on the secret bombing of Cambodia that began in 1969 and charges of tax fraud against Nixon, were not approved.
Some of the Republican defense of Nixon probably boiled down to party loyalty, according to Jeffrey Engel, a presidential historian at Southern Methodist University. “For a long time, they just weren’t going to pull the trigger on a duly elected president from their own party,” he said. Republicans also faced pressure from a small but powerful group of activists who were vehemently opposed to Nixon’s impeachment and were aggressively lobbying their representatives not to abandon him. “Increasingly, [Republican leadership] thought it would be better for the party if Nixon could be persuaded to go,” said Mark Nevin, a history professor at Ohio University Lancaster who has studied Republican support for Nixon at the end of his presidency. “But nobody wanted to be the one who pushed him out.”
It also took a while for all of the evidence to emerge, and ultimately, the scope of Nixon’s wrongdoing helped convince some of the Judiciary Committee Republicans to break ranks, in spite of pressure from leadership to maintain a united front in support of Nixon. “It wasn’t a single act that moved them — it was the pattern of corruption by the president,” Naftali said. Nixon’s support was crumbling by the time the Judiciary Committee voted on impeachment, but he didn’t lose the full support of his party until the “smoking gun” tape clearly implicated him in the Watergate cover-up, at which point he lost even the Republicans on the committee who had voted against impeachment. Two days after the transcript of the tape became public, Goldwater led a delegation to the White House to tell Nixon it was over.
It’s hard to imagine what such a “smoking gun” would look like today, in part because the Democrats’ investigations are still in the information-gathering stage, but it does seem that we haven’t arrived there yet. One important difference between the Nixon era and today: Trump hasn’t really denied the allegations against him, while several historians told me that many Republicans probably believed Nixon was telling the truth about his lack of involvement in the cover-up. The shock of discovering just how much Nixon had misled them was also an important factor.
“It was an enormous betrayal for some of Nixon’s allies when they realized that he had been lying the whole time,” Engel said. “Because it meant they had been lying too.”
Partisanship can be a powerful barrier to impeachment
One of the oft-cited lessons of Watergate is that impeaching a president requires a bipartisan effort. And in the end, it did. Republicans voted with Democrats to subpoena Nixon and to approve the articles of impeachment, which was a significant political risk. But focusing only on that part of the saga doesn’t account for how strongly many Republicans defended their president throughout most of the investigation. “The Nixon case shows that seemingly intractable partisan disagreement over impeachment can give way if the president’s conduct is bad enough and the proof of it is clear enough,” said Joshua Matz, a constitutional lawyer and the co-author of “To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment.” “But it also shows that this is a high barrier, and it didn’t happen until awfully late in the process.”
At several points, according to Nevin’s research, Goldwater and other prominent Republicans considered pushing Nixon to resign, but instead continued to defend him because they were afraid of a backlash from his supporters. “Some Republicans were actually relieved when the tape came out because it was so obviously obstruction that you couldn’t come to any other conclusion,” Nevin said. “It freed them from having to make what would have been a very difficult decision.”
Today some Republicans may be facing a similar dilemma: Do they ignore party allegiance and turn on the president, or double down on party loyalty?
One complicating factor here is that if Republicans were to abandon Trump, history does not suggest that Trump loyalists would easily forgive them for joining the Democrats’ impeachment effort. Even though most Americans did eventually support removing Nixon from office, Republican voters were mostly not part of that consensus. Days before he resigned, a Gallup poll found that only 31 percent of Republicans thought Nixon should no longer be president. And some of those supporters deeply resented their representatives for their role in ousting Nixon, which may even have contributed to the Democratic landslide in the 1974 midterm elections.
Of course, looking back on what happened in Watergate can’t tell us whether Trump will survive this particular scandal. Some Republicans have started to criticize Trump’s behavior, but none have taken the momentous step of supporting an impeachment inquiry. So Trump’s removal certainly doesn’t seem likely now. But if nothing else, history offers a good reminder about how challenging it is to predict the future. After all, until a few weeks before his resignation, Nixon’s fate wasn’t a foregone conclusion either.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

12 years old
Halloween candy season is officially here, but an investigation by the Washington Post into cocoa farming found that child labor continues to be “an epidemic” in the supply chain of several popular brands, including Hershey, Mars and Nestlé, with some workers as young as 12 years old. According to a 2015 U.S. Labor Department report, more than 2 million children worked in dangerous labor conditions in the areas where cocoa is grown (two-thirds of the world’s cocoa supply comes from West Africa). Companies first signed a Congressional pledge to rid the industry of its worst child labor practices in 2001, with a target date of 2005. They are expected to fail another deadline next year.

5 purebred bulls
There’s a lot of life and death on farms, but the final state of five young purebred bulls at the Silvies Valley Ranch in eastern Oregon still comes across as “an eerie scene.” NPR reporter Anna King says the animals were found “drained of blood and with body parts precisely removed,” including the tongue and genitals carefully cut out. “The bull looks like a giant, deflated plush toy.” So far, there are no credible leads. [NPR]
1 gun-toting dog
Puppies aren’t usually known for being violent, but caretaker Tina Springer was accidentally shot by a 7-month-old yellow Labrador while both were waiting in a car for a train to pass in Nash, Oklahoma. The dog apparently set off a .22 caliber gun located under the vehicle’s console after jumping from the backseat, firing a bullet into Springer’s left thigh. The driver and dog owner, Brent Parks, used a belt as a tourniquet for Springer’s injury until an ambulance arrived. [Enid News]
781 Navajo women
A federally funded study on uranium exposure levels among 781 Navajo women and infants found 26 percent of the people screened had concentrations of the radioactive metal that exceeded levels found in the highest 5 percent of the U.S. population. This is decades after mining for the metal had ended in the Navajo Nation. Information about the study was shared during a congressional hearing in Albuquerque where elected officials are pushing for legislation that would expand the state’s radiation compensation to more residents.

$680 million in drugmaker spending
A Bloomberg Government analysis of tax filings and data from the Senate Finance Committee shows hundreds of nonprofit entities receiving more than $680 million from six major pharmaceutical companies last year, more than double the amount donated in 2015. Some of the money went into campaigns against federal legislation aimed at reducing the cost of medicine, as well as education grants and fellowship programs for physicians. [Bloomberg Government]

He Fixed Them In Week 5.,Michael Salfino,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"Deshaun Watson entered Week 5 trying to rebound from yet another sack-filled performance. Over the past two seasons, he’s been dumped more times than any other passer. But rather than point fingers at his team’s porous offensive line, he resolved to address his role in the problem.
“I held the football too long, and I fumbled the ball and things like that,” Watson said after the Houston Texans’ 16-10 home loss to the Carolina Panthers on Sept. 29. “The O-line did a hell of a job. That’s me. I’ve got to check the ball down, take what they give us.” He also said that he failed to “scan and pick up the blitz.”
On Sunday, Watson’s improvement those areas was so dramatic that it led to one of the greatest passing performances in NFL history. In the Texans’ 53-32 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, Watson’s passer rating was perfect over 33 pass attempts, of which he completed 28 for 426 yards and five touchdowns. That was tied for the most attempts with a perfect passer rating since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. And his 98.2 raw QBR (not adjusted for opponent) was the 14th-best ever for a quarterback with at least 30 pass attempts.
Most importantly, the Falcons didn’t sack Watson even one time. It was just the second sackless game in Watson’s career. (In his other 26 games, he’s been dumped 99 times, or nearly four per game.) In the two games in his career without a sack, Watson threw 10 touchdown passes on 53 attempts with no picks. The strength of the opposing defense matters in contextualizing how well Watson performed, obviously, but when he can avoid these negative plays, Watson looks more like Patrick Mahomes and less like Luke Falk.
The first way Watson improved was simply in his time to attempt a pass. From the start of 2018 though Week 4 of this season, when Watson was sacked 80 times in 20 games, he attempted 53 percent of his passes less than 2.5 seconds from the snap, compared with the NFL average of 57 percent.1 But in Week 5, Watson reinvented himself as a much more decisive and quick-trigger QB: He threw 73 percent of his 33 total attempts less than 2.5 seconds after the snap.
Importantly, he did not cut his time to throw by throwing shorter passes. Watson was his typical downfield self, averaging 8.73 air yards per attempt compared with 8.67 in the prior period. (The NFL average since 2018 is 7.89.)
But what about his efforts to improve his blitz recognition? We measured this by examining how often a quarterback faces an unblocked rusher. Though this can happen because of miscommunication among the offensive linemen, Watson suggested that, as quarterback, he’s the one responsible: He has to make pass-blocking adjustments to account for pass-rushers and also identify any potential rusher not assigned a blocker at the snap.

The Falcons still beat the Texans’ protection with at least one unblocked rusher at a slightly higher rate than Watson had faced previously: They broke through nine times in 36 dropbacks, or a rate of 25 percent, compared with 21 percent of Watson’s dropbacks from 2018 through Week 4.
But Watson recognized the danger and beat the blitz with well-timed passes. On the nine plays where he faced unblocked rushers, he was 9-for-9 for 136 yards and a touchdown, posted a near-perfect 99.7 QBR and had a passer rating of 155.8. Not only was Watson not sacked, but he didn’t even need to run — which meant that he could avoid exposing himself to the punishment of being tackled. And keeping Watson pain-free has been a challenge for the Texans: He was beaten up so savagely last year that he couldn’t fly in for a road game. (He had to take a bus.)
Sacks aren’t merely a threat to the quarterback’s health — they also suffocate an offense. I reported last year in The Wall Street Journal that on a series of downs without a sack, the chance of getting another first down (or touchdown) is 74.7 percent. A first-down sack lowers that probability to 36.7 percent, and a sack on second down drops it to 22.1 percent.
And that’s with an average quarterback. Watson is a superior QB who can seem unstoppable when he avoids getting dumped in his own backfield. On Sunday, he’ll probably need to keep his uniform relatively clean again at Kansas City to win a showdown with Mahomes. And now, it’s the Chiefs who are facing protection woes, with Mahomes getting dumped more times in Week 5 against the Colts (four) than previously all season (three). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the result for Mahomes was the lowest point total (13) of his career.
Looking Ahead: Week 6
Best matchup: No. 4 Philadelphia at No. 10 Minnesota (-1.5), 1 p.m. ET SundayMatchup quality: 87th percentile2Matchup evenness: 82nd percentile
A couple of weird trends collide in the best game of Week 6. As we alluded to in Monday’s NFL chat, the Vikings only ever seem to beat the teams they’re supposed to; so far this season, Minnesota is 3-0 as a favorite in our Elo model and 0-2 as an underdog. (It’s part of a long-running issue under QB Kirk Cousins.) Meanwhile, you never know what to expect from the Eagles, who have won games as underdogs — like when they beat the Packers in Green Bay two weeks ago — and lost as heavy favorites — like when they fell to the Lions at home the week before that. So something’s got to give in this matchup. Elo says the Vikings have the edge (55 percent chance to win) at home … but the Eagles are also a good opponent, the likes of which Minnesota has struggled against in the Cousins Era. Since last season, the Vikings are 1-6-1 against teams with an Elo rating over 1550 going into the matchup. Then again, that one victory? It was against the Eagles in Week 5 of last season. See, these teams are weird! But we’ll learn more about each of them Sunday.

Biggest playoff implications: No. 7 San Francisco at No. 3 L.A. Rams (-3.5), 4:05 p.m. ET SundayPotential shift in playoff odds: 28.9 total percentage points
It’s been musical favorites in the NFC West recently. Los Angeles entered last week in the driver’s seat, but the Rams were also playing the week’s most important game — against the Seahawks — and Seattle won, briefly making it favorites to win the division. Then, San Francisco’s Monday night demolition of Cleveland made the Niners favorites, which is where things currently stand. But that could shift again after Sunday’s game between the 49ers and Rams. According to our model, both teams’ playoff odds will shift by double-digit percentage points no matter what. If the Rams win, they’d gain 13 points, and the Niners would lose 11 points, though each team would still be more likely to make the playoffs than not. But if San Francisco wins, look out: The 49ers would gain 17 points of postseason probability, giving them a commanding 85 percent chance of making the playoffs. And the Rams would see a massive 20-point decline in their playoff probability, making them only 37 percent likely to return to the playoffs and defend their NFC title. Our model gives the Rams a 62 percent chance of winning Sunday — and thereby making that apocalyptic scenario moot — but if they don’t, the consequences could be big.

Home teams are in bold.
The scoring system is nonlinear, so readers’ average points don’t necessarily match the number of points that would be given to the average reader prediction.
After back-to-back losses against the field in Weeks 3 and 4, Elo got its revenge in Week 5. The readers had a few strong picks — most notably in rightly downplaying Tennessee’s favorite status in the Music City Miracle rematch (Buffalo won) and setting Cincy as only the slimmest of favorites against Arizona (and the Bengals did indeed disappoint). But that was offset by the readers’ overconfidence in Chase Daniel and the Bears, Baker Mayfield and the Browns, Gardner Minshew and the Jags and Jared Goff and the Rams. Altogether, the average player lost to Elo by a margin of 19.8 points in Week 5, the widest margin either side has had in any week so far this season.
Still, congrats are in order to Mark Nitsche, who led all readers in Week 5 with 229.0 points, and to Jamie Porter, whose total of 440.9 points leads the full-season contest. Thanks to everyone who played — and if you haven’t, be sure to get in on the action! You can make picks now and try your luck against Elo, even if you missed Week 5.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-would-happen-if-american-voters-all-got-together-and-talked-politics/,2019-10-09,,,features,"Oct. 9, 2019",What Would Happen If American Voters All Got Together And Talked Politics?,Sarah Frostenson,FiveThirtyEight,Polling,"There is a story that Stanford University political science professor Jim Fishkin likes to tell about George Gallup, the man who helped popularize public opinion polling in America.
After the 1936 presidential election — which Gallup’s polling correctly called for Franklin D. Roosevelt — Gallup delivered a lecture at Princeton in which he argued that polling could allow voters from across America to come together, like in a New England town meeting, to debate and decide on important issues facing the country. As he saw it, newspapers and the radio would broadcast the debate, and polls would capture what people thought after having heard from all sides. It would be, to quote Gallup, as if “the nation is literally in one great room.”
Eighty-some years later, Fishkin says Gallup’s vision hasn’t quite held up: “He was right in that there could be a shared discussion and polling about it, but wrong in that the room was so big that nobody was really paying attention.”
But what if you could get the whole country into a more manageably sized room?
That is — quite literally — what Fishkin and his Stanford colleague, Larry Diamond, tried to do. Over the course of four days in September, in partnership with Helena, a nonpartisan institute that funded the event, and NORC at the University of Chicago, they gathered a nationally representative sample of 526 registered voters1 in a suburb of Dallas to talk about issues that Americans have said are important to them in 2020: immigration, health care, the economy, the environment and foreign policy. They called it “America in One Room.”
The aims of the project were lofty. If you gather all of America in one room and provide them with facts and a set of arguments from both sides of the political aisle, can respectful, moderated discussion change people’s minds?
The answer: Sort of.
In September, a nationally representative group of registered voters gathered to talk over some of the big issues driving the 2020 election.									HelenaThere was some movement on the event’s five issues, as captured in the pre- and post-event surveys conducted by NORC, though how much movement differed depending on the question. Fishkin and Diamond found, for instance, that support grew among Republicans for proposals like increasing the number of visas for skilled workers and for less-skilled workers in industries that need them. And support for proposals like a $15 minimum wage and issuing $1,000 per month to all adults (a universal basic income) fell among Democrats.
But it’s unclear how lasting these changes will be, or even whether these types of events are the best way to encourage real political change. They’re not very practical, for one. Moreover, for people for whom these political issues hit close to home — those struggling to pay for health insurance, for example, or worried about family members being deported — the idea of engaging with the other side might seem overly idealistic, daunting or even useless. Some issues just don’t have much of a middle ground when you get down to the level of individual people.
Still, Diamond told FiveThirtyEight that if they could raise the money, they planned to survey the participants again in six or nine months to find out what, if any, changes had endured.
Many of the participants FiveThirtyEight spoke with, though, seemed to think that the emphasis on people changing their minds might be missing the larger purpose of an event like this.
“I don’t think people’s minds are changing,” said Susan Bosco, a retiree living in Fairfax, Virginia. “I think what we’re doing is respecting other people’s opinions more and not seeing them as ogres.” Robert Granger from Bristol, Tennessee, and Jamie Andersen, from Portland, Oregon, who were in Bosco’s group for the event, agreed, saying they had decided to attend so that they could better understand what makes people hold the opinions they do. “We all want to see our country succeed, regardless of race, gender or what part of the country you’re from. But we all have different ideas of how to get there,” Granger said.
One of the discussion groups talking about the economy and taxes.									HelenaAnd the survey results back them up. Pre- and post-event surveys found most people who came as Democrats left as Democrats, and the same with Republicans. But while the experiment didn’t make people change how they identify politically, it did seem to make them more understanding of those who hold a different view. As London Robinson of Chicago told FiveThirtyEight, many people in her discussion group made arguments that she expected given where they were from or their political party, but she was also surprised that people from different parties “think just like I do.” “I didn’t think they would think that way,” Robinson said. “It was breathtaking to see that.”
That’s something. Contrary to conventional wisdom, most Americans don’t watch and read only partisan news outlets. But the country is largely segregated by politics — most people live near and work with like-minded souls, and many dislike their counterparts from across the political aisle. So the America in One Room gathering was designed to give people a low-stakes environment to debate politics, because as Diamond said, “These are dangerous conversations out there in the real world.” For instance, a 2016 Pew Research Center study on partisanship found that 55 percent of Democrats said the Republican Party makes them “afraid,” while 49 percent of Republicans said the same about the Democratic Party.
In a convention hall outside Dallas, though, getting everyone into the same room seemed to change that some:
Participants didn’t identify as more politically moderate after the event, but there is evidence that they viewed those on the other side of the political aisle more positively. When asked to rate their feelings toward the other party on a scale of 0 to 100 — with higher numbers meaning warmer feelings — Democrats’ views of Republicans improved by nearly 12 points on average. For Republicans, the jump was even larger, almost 16 points.2
Before the event, people were also more likely to say that the other side was “not thinking clearly.” On a scale of 0 to 10 — where 10 was strongly agreeing with the statement that your political opponents are not thinking clearly and 0 was strongly disagreeing with the statement — the average response dropped from 6.2 to 4.7, indicating that even if participants didn’t agree with each other more, they had more respect for those they disagreed with.
Participants also left the event with a better opinion of democracy and their place in it. They were asked to rate how well they thought democracy was working on a 10-point scale, with 0 meaning that democracy was working “extremely poorly” and 10 being “extremely well.” On average, respondents’ ratings increased by 1.6 points. There were also increases in the number of respondents who agreed that public officials care a lot about what “people like me” think, and in those who felt they have a say in what government does or who thought that their opinions about politics were “worth listening to.”
Take Rob Snyder of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, one of the participants FiveThirtyEight talked to. He emailed after the event to say that while he’d always considered politics as something “better left for someone else to worry about,” his experience had made him feel like he was no longer just “one person with one voice and one vote.”
And finally, the event may have gotten us one step closer to Gallup’s vision of a more informed and empowered electorate. In the post-event survey, respondents were asked seven multiple-choice questions testing their political knowledge about things like which political party holds the majority in the House and Senate, and what the major provisions of the Affordable Care Act are. And on average, participants answered one more question correctly after the event. Participants also skipped3 about one fewer question on average, suggesting they knew (or thought they knew) the answer to more questions.
For some respondents, like Veronica Munoz of Los Angeles, the event sparked an interest in being better informed. Munoz said that while she was familiar with some of the proposals being discussed, there was a lot she didn’t know, so she was glad she had come. “Now I’m more interested in reading the newspaper to find out what’s going on with our politics and our economy and policies than I was before,” she said.
Granted, the real-world implications of these findings are limited at best. Most people don’t have the opportunity to spend their weekends debating big political issues with a group that’s carefully selected to be representative of their fellow Americans — and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. But in an era in which we’re increasingly polarized as a country and even facts are under fire, the idea that an event devoted to political debate can increase knowledge, decrease skepticism of the other side, and bolster participants’ faith in democracy — and their place in it — certainly seems like good news.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-fewer-easy-wins-for-the-power-five-just-ask-the-pac-12/,2019-10-09,,,features,"Oct. 9, 2019",There Are Fewer Easy Wins For The Power Five. Just Ask The Pac-12.,Jake Lourim,FiveThirtyEight,College Football,"They come from every corner of the country. They have been ranked and unranked, bluebloods and doormats. They are the major-conference teams — from the Power Five conferences1 plus Notre Dame — that have fallen prey to an upset by an upstart from the lower tier of Football Bowl Subdivision schools (now called the Group of Five).2 In the past 15 years, among schools that have been Power Five members for all of that time, only Ohio State, Southern California, Florida and Texas have been spared.
But this year, the damage has been particularly consistent. Power Five schools are just 69-18 (.793) against Group of Five opponents, their lowest collective winning percentage since 2008, when they went 60-17 (.779). And this is after a wave of conference realignment earlier this decade, when the major conferences snatched up some of the lower ranks’ most consistent winners, such as Utah, Louisville and Texas Christian. If two more Power Five teams lose to Group of Five foes this season, the 20 losses will mark the most since at least 2004. Nonconference games are mostly over, but some chances remain. Arkansas-Western Kentucky, Tennessee-UAB and South Carolina-Appalachian State are three to watch down the stretch.
The American Athletic Conference may generate the most cries for Group of Five respect — the league has tirelessly campaigned for the term “Power Six” to catch on — but this year, the most successful giant killers have come from the Mountain West, which has eight of the 18 Group of Five victories with just 10 losses. Those eight wins come from seven different teams,3 meaning that more than half of the league has knocked off a Power Five opponent. That’s especially impressive considering that just five of those 18 Mountain West wins came at home.
And yes, the oft-maligned Pac-12 has been the most susceptible this year, responsible for six of the Power Five’s 18 losses with just eight wins. The league’s 8-6 record this season and 9-6 record in 2018 are the worst marks for a major conference against the Group of Five since at least 2014.
This trend is paradoxical: The disparities between the bigger and smaller conferences are wider than ever before. The Big Ten’s massive media-rights contracts with Fox, ESPN and CBS are worth $440 million per year, and each school that receives a full share of revenue from the league gets more than $50 million. The full SEC revenue share per school is $43.7 million a year. The AAC, meanwhile, just signed a new 12-year TV deal with ESPN for $83.3 million per year, or about $7 million per school annually. That money can make a big difference in areas like head coaching compensation, where Memphis was the only Group of Five school to rank in the nation’s top 50 last year, according to USA Today’s database.
The five major conferences distanced themselves further from the rest when they obtained the right in 2014 to create their own rules while remaining part of the NCAA. Five months later, those conferences passed a rule allowing their schools to provide marginal cost-of-attendance stipends to athletes, another perk of attending an upper-tier school.
It’s not as if the Group of Five teams are making strides in recruiting — after last season’s national signing day, only Boise State and Central Florida beat out any Power Five team in Bill Connelly’s weighted recruiting rankings from the past four classes. Yet those smaller schools are making up ground, except in the only place it matters to some teams: the College Football Playoff.
Since the start of the playoff after the 2014 season, there’s been no clear way for a Group of Five contender to compete for a national championship, a drumbeat that grew louder with UCF, its 25-game winning streak and its self-proclaimed 2017 “national championship.” Boise State is this year’s UCF, or rather UCF was last year’s Boise State. The original Cinderella is back to its undefeated ways, 5-0 this season and likely to be favored in each of its seven games left in the regular season. But when the CFP committee unveils its rankings, barring mass chaos in the SEC, it’s almost inconceivable that Boise State will get near the top four.
An undefeated Boise State team snubbed from the national-championship picture would make 2019 feel a lot like 2009, but this year there’s justification for it. As much success as Group of Five teams have had in stealing nonconference guarantee games, they’re arguably no closer to the top of college football, for the competitive-balance reasons mentioned earlier. Boise State is currently No. 31 in ESPN’s Football Power Index, 23.7 points worse than Alabama on a neutral field, and UCF faced similar realities last year, even before quarterback McKenzie Milton’s horrific knee injury ended his season.
The current college football landscape offers those teams few windows of opportunity. UCF saw Power Five chances against Georgia Tech in 2017 and North Carolina in 2018 canceled because of hurricanes. Boise State scheduled a season opener against Florida State in Jacksonville when it seemed like that could be a resume-bolstering win. Plenty of voices are calling for the CFP to expand to eight teams and include the best Group of Five champion, but the current CFP contract doesn’t expire until 2025. Until then, in all likelihood, the Group of Five’s September upsets may be their ceiling.

We also saw last season’s MVP limping around the field on Sunday night. Guys, how worried should we be about Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs?
Salfino (Michael Salfino, FiveThirtyEight contributor): This was the second game in a row where a team took the deep ball away from Mahomes. Of course, Tyreek Hill could be back next week, so that could turn the tables in the Chiefs’ favor again, regardless. Mahomes’s ankle injury didn’t seem too serious, but it could affect his ability to evade the rush for a few weeks, as it did after the injury last night.
neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): Yeah. He’s had some ankle issues already earlier this season, but he’s expected to be fine from all the reports I’ve seen. What his performance really did was underscore just how strange it is for Mahomes to not be amazing.
Believe it or not, this was only the second start of his career in which he was below-average in our Elo QB metric.

joshua.hermsmeyer (Josh Hermsmeyer, NFL analyst): I think the same is true of QBR — but I suppose our metric and QBR are closely related.
neil: Right. Mahomes’s previous below-average start was his first career start, at the end of 2017. So that means Mahomes had a streak of 22 consecutive above-average starts end yesterday.
Salfino: Mahomes had been on an epic run of efficiency on 20-plus air-yard passes, and in the past two weeks, he was just 4 for 15 with a passer rating of 80.7. Not good.
sara.ziegler: So should we have expected that his amazing run was going to come to an end at some point, and this was just the time it happened? Or is there something else going on here?
Salfino: I think the Lions and Matt Patricia went to school on it, and the Colts followed up even with an injury-riddled secondary. Now the ball is in the Chiefs’ court. Sort of the NFL circle of life.
neil: If anybody can adapt, it’s Andy Reid. And it still helps to have a QB who can do this:

joshua.hermsmeyer: I think it’s interesting to see how reliant the team really is on its all-world QB. It’s just so clear how much he means to the Chiefs, and I would think their top priority is to keep him healthy.
Salfino: Someone posted a diagram on that play showing that pass-rushers have to coordinate rather than going for the cheese in the same direction. The deeper rusher, we were told, should have gone outside to keep Mahomes contained. Sort of like how the Raptors worked in Jurassic Park. 🙂


Teams have to learn to coordinate their rushes, if the DT sees the DR go for it, he has to get outside to contain…it's not called, it's experience thing as great as that play is, if Colts don't get all balled up on their rush. it makes it harder #INDvsKC #ChiefsKingdom #Colts pic.twitter.com/AuUnOpmrlJ
— 𝐏𝐫𝐨 𝐅𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐛𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐉𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐥🏈 (@NFL_Journal) October 7, 2019

neil: And here I thought all the Raptor talk this week would be confined to basketball …
sara.ziegler: LOL
So what do the Chiefs need to do to take care of Mahomes? The offensive line looked … not good.
Salfino: Deeper passes require more protection. Maybe they need to get into a quicker rhythm and forget about emphasizing the deep throws so often. His protection for his career to date has been top-notch.
joshua.hermsmeyer: There are schemes you can employ to buy more time and prevent him from having to hang in the pocket, but they’re probably not sustainable. It’s also tough because what makes him so special is what he does when a play breaks down — and that’s also a dangerous time to be a QB.
Salfino: But they’re still winning the battle of the passing game so decisively for the season to date that I really believe that, despite the loss, the Chiefs are right on schedule. The pass defense is decent. The run defense … not so good. But high-scoring teams naturally evolve this way, if they’re smart. It’s the old Colts/Peyton Manning model.
sara.ziegler: So if the Chiefs are going to be fine, how about the Cowboys? They looked incredibly flat on Sunday against the Packers.
neil: The Cowboys are now 3-0 against teams with pregame Elo ratings under 1500 (i.e., average) and 0-2 against teams with pregame ratings over 1500.
Salfino: If you believe the Cowboys have the kind of high-powered passing offense their per-play stats suggest, they’re golden. I’m not sure I believe that, though. I’m not quite ready to go all-in on Dak Prescott as a true franchise-level QB. He’s good, though.
Neil’s point about their win quality is spot-on.
neil: Though, to push back against my own snarky observation about opponent-quality splits, Dallas did beat six above-1500 Elo teams during that period last season when they won eight times in nine games down the stretch.
So it’s not necessarily a persistent split. But it has stood out so far this season.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Dak has been fantastic. I thought they mounted a respectable second-half comeback. If I’m a Cowboys fan, I’m not worried when my team’s QB is playing like one of the top 5 at his position.

sara.ziegler: So the game did nothing to change anyone’s priors on the Cowboys?
joshua.hermsmeyer: It was a loss, so not great! But I’m not selling on the Cowboys yet.
Salfino: Definitely not selling. They are a legit Super Bowl contender.
sara.ziegler: You guys are refusing to overreact, and it’s annoying.
neil: Maybe the past two games have settled them back into the tier below the top contenders again.
Salfino: You can overreact to Captain Kirk, Sara. The Vikings are an offensive juggernaut.
sara.ziegler: I will not.
And they are not.
neil: Speaking of teams and QBs that play well only against below-average opponents…
sara.ziegler: Damn.
Tough but fair.
neil: That IS a trend dating back to last season.
Salfino: The Giants defense is … inviting.
sara.ziegler: I am on record saying that the Vikings were 100 percent going to win that game. It was a classic game of absolutely no stakes, so Kirk Cousins played well. Easiest call I’ve ever made.
neil: Can’t he just convince himself that all games have no stakes?? We said it ourselves last week: We all die in the end. Loosen up a little, Kirk.
sara.ziegler: LOLOL
joshua.hermsmeyer: I was just happy to see the Squeaky Wheel narrative pay off for Adam Thielen. Two touchdowns was a great game for him.
sara.ziegler: OK, so what about the other notable NFC North teams this week? Aaron Rodgers did nothing, but the Packers looked … great?
Salfino: The Packers pretty much ignored their wide receivers in the game. It somehow worked.
We may have to accept that the Lions are the best team in the North. Did I just type that?
sara.ziegler: The same Lions that tied Arizona? Those Lions?
neil: Let’s not go crazy here.
Salfino: Actually, the Vikings grade better in my key stat — net yards per pass play — but I don’t want Sara to have unrealistic expectations. I will say the Lions are playing better than the Bears.
sara.ziegler: My expectations are always as low as possible.
neil: BTW, all four NFC North teams still have winning records.
sara.ziegler: But what about those Bears? Is Chase Daniel not the answer???
Salfino: No less not the answer than Mitchell Trubisky.
I’ve tied myself up in double negatives.
Daniel and Trubisky are a double negative.
neil: 😂
joshua.hermsmeyer: I need more coffee to parse these Salfino Bears takes. Interestingly, if you were hanging your hat on their defense being great against the pass this season, early returns are not that good. Chicago, so far, has allowed the fifth-highest completion percentage in the league.
neil: Daniel basically played like you would expect from somebody with four career starts in 10 NFL seasons.
Salfino: Daniel is beating the system.
But Jon Gruden is still a good coach. That he’s 3-2 — with a team that is not talented and with all the Antonio Brown distractions — is impressive. The Raiders should be a losing team and probably still will be, but it won’t be because of Gruden.
neil: What about JAY Gruden? Lol.
sara.ziegler: First coaching casualty!
neil: Josh, is the Bears’ performance another example of defenses just regressing to the mean incredibly quickly in the NFL?
joshua.hermsmeyer: I don’t know what to make of NFL defenses, tbh. Some claim there was a jet-lag factor with Chicago, or they didn’t sleep well. It’s all a muddle.
Salfino: I’m shocked by how bad the Ravens pass defense has looked, even yesterday against the third-string QB.
sara.ziegler: Devlin Hodges was the best part of that game.
That story is my favorite of the season so far. Guy goes undrafted, signed to the practice squad, makes the team because some other backup is traded away … then, BAM. He’s leading a second-half comeback.
Salfino: The Browns may win the AFC North by default even with a loss tonight.
neil: We do still have Cleveland as favorites (granted, at 49 percent) to win the division.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I feel like you were bagging on Baker Mayfield just a week or two ago, Mike. How quickly the winds change.
neil: And we were pumping up Lamar Jackson!
Salfino: No, I was defending Baker. I was bagging on Baker in August. I am still bagging on Baker Mayfield the spokesperson.
neil: Lol
BTW, speaking of Jackson, he had the second-worst QB Elo game of the week yesterday. After that hot start, his rolling QB rating is basically average again.
However, the worst by a MILE belonged to poor Luke Falk of the Jets. In fact, Poor Sad Luke Falk had the worst QB game of the entire season. Meanwhile, Deshaun Watson of the Texans had the best game of the entire season!

joshua.hermsmeyer: Mike’s Jets: Out indefinitely.
neil: This was such a sad play:

Salfino: Jets fans like me have not had a season at all yet, and it’s Week 6. Can’t even kill the team for the way they’re playing. Can’t practice Falk if you think Sam Darnold can play because you have to get him ready for his health’s sake. And you can’t know how big his spleen is. But practice is not gonna save Falk, who just has no clock in his head for when to throw the ball. That’s fatal in the NFL. The Jets defense is actually … OK.
neil: When will Jets QBs not be on the receiving end of the universe’s jokes?
joshua.hermsmeyer: It’s the curse Namath put on the franchise after that embarrassingly inept attempt at hitting on Suzy Kolber on the sidelines.

sara.ziegler: I’ve never before thought about how big a quarterback’s spleen is.
Maybe never want to again.

Biden’s share of cable news clips and online news stories decreased from last week, but he was still mentioned more on cable news than every other candidate combined.
Much of the recent coverage of Biden emerged in response to news of President Trump’s phone call to Ukraine, in which he asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son. Last week, we saw some evidence that this Ukraine scandal could be drawing media attention away from the 2020 Democratic primaries, and this week it seems that continues to be true.

Includes all candidates that qualify as “major” in FiveThirtyEight’s rubric. Each network’s daily news coverage is chopped up into 15-second clips, and each clip that includes a candidate’s name is counted as one mention. For both cable and online news, our search queries look for an exact match for each candidate’s name, except for Julián Castro, for whom our search query is “Julian Castro” OR “Julián Castro.” Media Cloud searches use two of the database’s publication lists: “top online news” and “digital native” publications. Percentages are calculated as the number of stories or clips mentioning each candidate divided by the number of stories or clips mentioning any of the 2020 Democratic contenders for that week.

But it’s not equally true across all the cable news networks. For the second week in a row, Biden was mentioned more on Fox News than on the other networks we monitor. He was mentioned in 855 clips on CNN and 851 clips on MSNBC, compared to 1,058 clips on Fox News, where he is more at the center of the Ukraine story.
But while Fox News does seem to be focusing more on Biden, it hasn’t reduced its coverage of other candidates as much as CNN and MSNBC seem to have. For example, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was mentioned in 254 clips on Fox News last week, but only 105 on CNN and 153 on MSNBC. That’s significantly fewer clips on CNN and MSNBC compared to the previous week, but not a huge change in the number of Fox News clips that mention her. And it’s not just true of Warren: There has been more of an overall reduction in mentions of non-Biden candidates on CNN and MSNBC compared to Fox News over the last two weeks.
As the Trump impeachment inquiry continues, we’ll be right here to see how the scandal affects the amount of media coverage that 2020 Democratic primary candidates get, and whether or not candidates other than Biden have a chance at the media spotlight. Stay tuned!

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/meet-the-washington-mystics-not-so-secret-weapon/,2019-10-08,,,features,"Oct. 8, 2019",Meet The Washington Mystics’ Not-So-Secret Weapon,Howard Megdal,FiveThirtyEight,WNBA,"As Elena Delle Donne played through the searing pain of a herniated disk on Sunday, she clearly wasn’t her usual, multi-dimensional star self for the Washington Mystics. In Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, she took just six shots all afternoon, making a single, labored drive to the basket.
But by the time that one dribble penetration came, the Mystics already led by 10 points, largely because of the work of Emma Meesseman. In a league where Delle Donne is considered sui generis, it is a remarkable bit of roster construction that Mystics coach and general manager Mike Thibault has held on to Meesseman, turning her into the Delle Donne understudy who would likely be a centerpiece performer on any other team.
“Emma’s been our missing piece,” said Mystics point guard Natasha Cloud after Sunday’s game. “Everyone knows that she’s the missing piece of a championship team.”
After missing the 2018 season to play overseas — and missing the Mystics’ WNBA Finals loss to the Seattle Storm — Meesseman has served primarily as “the Delle Donne” in Washington’s sets when the MVP isn’t on the floor. Meesseman’s integration into the lineup has been so smooth that prior to Game 3, when Thibault still didn’t know whether Delle Donne could even play, he wasn’t worried.
“The game plan is working much the same, as far as how we’re going to play,” Thibault said while watching Delle Donne take her first shots on the court about 90 minutes before Game 3. “[We] just plugged in some people into the spots. Other than that, it’s just, we run the same plays for Emma that we do for Elena.”
It’s hard to overstate how much of a luxury that is. The 6-foot-4 Meesseman pushes Delle Donne in practice and is a true inside-outside performer capable of emulating the 2019 MVP and approximating her per-40-minute scoring production — as well as anyone can, anyway.
The luxury was on full display Sunday afternoon. Delle Donne played 26 minutes, and Meesseman played 25 minutes, but it was Meesseman who could move without the ball unfettered by a back injury, getting the shots Delle Donne customarily does in the flow of the offense. She not only scored a game-high 21 points, but she also hit her shots at critical times, including a trio of 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter that helped put the game out of reach.
“Emma was a monster,” Delle Donne said admiringly of her teammate. “She was on the attack. So confident. Emma is such a good player, and we need her to just continue to attack because no one can guard her one-on-one. She requires double-teams, triple-teams to be guarded.”
Sounds a lot like Delle Donne, right?
So does the production this season. Delle Donne was rightly feted by the basketball world for her 50-40-90 season, the first in WNBA history. You know who else finished at 50-40-90, though? With 55.2 percent from the field, 42.2 percent from three and 90.5 percent from the free throw line, that would be Meesseman. (Though without meeting the minimum attempts necessary in each category to qualify for the season leaderboard.)
Sun coach Curt Miller acknowledged that he’ll need to find an answer to both Mystics in Game 4 if the Sun are going to extend their season. “We’ll take a look at different schemes,” Miller said. “We’ll take a look at different matchups. But, again, they’re both 50-40-90 kids. This is not something that they’re not capable of doing. They’re shot makers. And they’re doing things that the league’s never seen.”
The Mystics are just 40 minutes from a WNBA championship, a validation of Delle Donne’s career in a new way. But for Delle Donne’s part, she hopes it sheds new light on the greatness of her offensive doppelgänger, too.
“I say it all the time: Emma is one of the greatest in the world,” Delle Donne said. “Her play overseas, what she does for her national team, she’s ready for this moment. And you can tell she’s relishing this moment.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happened-to-the-kamala-harris-campaign/,2019-10-08,,,features,"Oct. 8, 2019",What Happened To The Kamala Harris Campaign?,Perry Bacon Jr.,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Kamala Harris was being described by some pundits as the Democratic front-runner before she even formally announced her candidacy. By early July, she seemed poised to challenge the polling leader, Joe Biden, who she had sharply criticized in the first Democratic debate. Harris stood at 15 percent in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, narrowly ahead of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Everything was coming up peaches.
Since then, however, Harris’s support has plunged. She’s down to mid-single digits in most national polls, trailing Biden, Sanders, Warren and even Pete Buttigieg. Her numbers are also dismal in the early states, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
So, what went wrong?
It’s too early to write Harris off; she remains well-liked by Democratic voters and has raised enough money to keep her campaign running for months. In other words, she is decently positioned to make gains if one of the top three candidates falters, or if she can create another moment, like in the first debate, that gets Democrats excited about her.
But it’s worth thinking about why Harris has stumbled from that post-first-debate high. We can’t know for sure, but here are some theories (most of these are not mutually exclusive, and many likely played a role, but I ordered them from strongest to weakest, in my view):
1. 2020 was never going to be her year in the first place 
This theory views Harris’s brief rise to 15 percent in national polls as something of a fluke. Instead, Harris’s “theory of the case” was never going to truly work in 2020 — the problem isn’t Harris, really, it’s that Democratic voters are looking for something else.
At least four 2020 candidates — Beto O’Rourke, Cory Booker, Buttigieg and Harris — have run campaigns that echo Barack Obama’s 2008 run: a youthful candidate without much Washington experience runs on charisma and personality more than a defined ideology or particular policy stands. Obama is beloved by Democrats, and his 2008 campaign was iconic, so it’s natural that 2020 candidates would try to emulate him. But Harris, Booker, Buttigieg and O’Rourke are at 14 percent combined in national polls, suggesting that Democratic voters aren’t looking for an Obama re-run.
In some ways, Harris has the same problem that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio had in the 2016 Republican primary, when they (wrongly) thought that the GOP would be excited about nominating a youngish, non-white standard-bearer with a solid conservative record.
There is evidence to support the theory that Harris just isn’t a good fit for 2020. To take just one example, Obama was 47 years old in 2008. (Harris is 54.) The three leading Democratic candidates are 78 years old (Sanders), 76 (Biden) and 70 (Warren.) Moreover, Harris’s uptick in national polls was an outlier. She was in only the high single digits for most of February, March, April, May and June, and has gradually receded back to single digits after surging in early July. Also, as mentioned, the other Obama-esque candidates aren’t really doing any better.
Even on ideological grounds, Harris has had “fit” issues. In her rise through California politics, Harris positioned herself as a left-but-not-that-left, establishment-friendly figure. But that may not be a great profile in today’s Democratic Party, which has grown increasingly liberal. Indeed, Harris has struggled to defend her sometimes more conservative decisions as a district attorney and later attorney general of California and even her choice of becoming a prosecutor in the first place. Her positioning might be just fine if Biden were not in the race winning the votes of African-Americans and Democrats to the right of Warren and Sanders, but Biden is in the race.
Speaking of …
2. Biden and Warren are just really strong candidates 
OK, forget Obama, the Democratic “mood” and the type of candidate best suited to that mood. Maybe Harris’s issues have more to do with brass-tacks electioneering.
The logical path for Harris was to win with a coalition of black voters and urban, college-educated white voters. But Biden and Warren have foreclosed those paths, respectively. Biden entered the race with sky-high popularity among black voters — as Obama’s vice president, he had an eight-year head start over Harris in establishing national ties with the black community. Warren, meanwhile, has surged in the last two months. Her strategy of rolling out policy plans and taking aggressively liberal stands — such as calling for Trump’s impeachment back in April — appears to have been a shrewd one in terms of wooing white, white-collar voters. Her rise has coincided pretty perfectly with Harris’s decline.
Remember that in the run-up to the 2016 Democratic primary election, liberal activists were begging Warren to run, while the center-left of the party was urging Biden to enter the race. With strong candidates monopolizing the left and the center-left, Harris has simply been crowded out.
3. Harris has not run a good campaign 
This theory takes the Harris surge in July more seriously — it was real and represented a real opportunity for the California senator. Her campaign simply squandered it.
Harris’s campaign launch speech was widely praised, and she was strong in the first debate. But she has not had a strategy of keeping herself in the news, the way Warren’s policy rollouts and liberal stances did earlier in the year. And Harris hasn’t built a clear brand and rationale for her candidacy along the lines of Buttigieg’s (“I’m young”), Biden’s (“I can beat Trump”), or Sanders and Warren (“I will take on the wealthy”).
I think this lack of clarity about the rationale for her candidacy — beyond appealing to a broad coalition of Democrats — has led to some of Harris’s stumbles. Her months-long waffling on Medicare for All likely stemmed from a desire to appease both the party’s left-wing (which favors MFA) and the center-left wing (which opposes MFA). But this field may be too big for anyone to straddle the left and center-left — and perhaps health care is an issue where you can’t equivocate. Similarly, while Harris attacked Biden’s past opposition to aggressive school integration plans, she was hesitant to offer much of a proposal of her own on that issue. It seemed like Harris wanted to use that issue to nod at her racial liberalism but wasn’t prepared to commit to a big school integration plan, which might be controversial.
4. She’s a woman of color in a party wary of nominating someone who it feels won’t connect with white voters in the Midwest in the general election
“Electability” has been a bigger issue for Democrats in 2020 than perhaps any presidential primary in modern history. Democrats want to beat Trump. And in the wake of his Electoral College win in 2016, many Democratic voters are concerned about winning over white swing voters, especially in the Midwest. Perhaps not coincidentally, Biden is viewed as the most electable — maybe because of his more moderate stances and vast political experience, but also maybe because he’s white and a man.
If Biden and Sanders and O’Rourke were the three leading candidates, I would have argued that this was Harris’s biggest barrier — Democratic voters are behaving like pundits and determining that only a white man can win the general election. But Warren’s rise at least suggests that many Democrats are open to nominating a woman.
Still, that doesn’t mean that this isn’t an issue for Harris’s campaign. Being a woman of color — Harris is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants — may be a bigger barrier than being a white woman. Why? Well, Harris’s strategy, more than Warren’s, depends on her doing really well with black voters. (I’m not saying this just because Harris is black, her campaign has made a strong showing in heavily black South Carolina a focal point.) It may be extra hard to succeed if you are black woman trying to win over black Democrats, many of whom feel like America embraced Trump as part of a racist backlash against Obama. Black voters in particular may like Harris but truly feel that Biden is much more likely to win a general election.


Here’s the thing: I don’t think Harris is out of this race. She has a clear and kind of obvious path back into the top tier if she can just win over some of the people who are now behind Biden (particularly black voters), Warren (college-educated whites) and the other candidates who are of her general ilk (Julián Castro, Booker, Buttigieg and O’Rourke have a combined 10 percent of the vote.) It’s entirely possible that in December or January, Democrats feel like Biden is not inspiring enough but also that Sanders and Warren have taken too many left-wing positions and are risky bets in the general. In such a scenario, Harris, along with Buttigieg, are the best positioned candidates to rise.
But a lot would have to happen for Harris to pull off such a comeback. Right now, she seems more likely to finish behind Andrew Yang than to win the Democratic nomination. That’s pretty stunning, and makes me think that perhaps all four of these things are happening at once. Maybe the best explanation for Harris’s struggles is that she hasn’t been a great candidate and also faced three things that were out of her control: the strong performances of Biden and Warren, doubts from some Democrats about a woman of color’s ability to win the general election and a Democratic electorate looking for either a really leftward shift (Warren, Sanders) or someone decidedly against that shift (Biden.)",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Maybe you call it a silo. Maybe you just call it an echo chamber. But whatever metaphorical, narrow and enclosed space you prefer, there’s a good chance you’ve been told that one of the great social problems of our time is Americans getting their political news from biased sources. Conservatives watch Fox News. Liberals watch MSNBC. The news tells us what we already believe and distorts reality around partisan talking points.
But here’s the thing: That’s not how it works. Turns out, news of our bloated, biased media diets has been greatly exaggerated. It could even be said that the “media bubble” narrative is … wait for it … fake news.
Last week, I wrote an article about how partisanship affects the way we interpret facts. Two people might see the same facts about the current impeachment investigation but interpret that news in wildly different ways. After that story ran, I got a lot of letters from folks who wanted to know how much of that effect was due to media bubbles. Sure, we interpret facts differently. But are we even getting the same facts?
Well, yeah, actually. Mostly, we are. That’s according to Brendan Nyhan, government professor at Dartmouth. “People have a notion from hearing about [information echo chambers] that most Americans are getting news and information from a very slanted media diet,” he told me. “Empirical evidence suggests that’s not true.”
Yes, seriously. Consider, for instance, the simple math of TV ratings. There are about 122 million Americans who told the Census Bureau that they voted in 2018. The vast majority of those voters don’t watch partisan cable news. FOX News and MSNBC pull in around 3 million viewers when their top hosts are on air. In contrast, around 5 million people tune in to each of the network nightly news shows. More Americans have a centrist media diet than a slanted one. And most Americans are basically fasting.
Even social media, which has provided new opportunities for echo chambers to form, doesn’t seem to be all that successful at politically isolating most of us. In 2018, Nyhan and his colleagues published a paper that found that, while Facebook really was a hive of fake news scum and villainy, the audience for those biased and often fabricated stories was relatively small. In a national sample of about 2,500 Americans, taken during the final weeks of the contentious 2016 presidential campaign, nearly 60 percent of all fake news visits came from the 10 percent of respondents with the most conservative media diets. Our national crisis is actually a niche issue.
Sure, we all do like to hear perspectives that verify what we already think we know. Who doesn’t enjoy being told that we are smarter than people we don’t like? But while lab experiments suggest that could cause us to silo ourselves, reality looks a little more nuanced. In a 2016 paper, researchers tracked a sample of 50,000 Americans who heavily consumed online news and found that their reading was overwhelmingly self-directed (rather than algorithm-selected) and mainstream centrist in orientation. And, while the use of social networks and search engines were associated with a larger partisan divide — they were also associated with people being more frequently exposed to more opinions they disagreed with.
That’s not to say that the media polarization that exists has no effect at all on our national politics. It might not be shaping the individual opinions of the vast majority of Americans, but the small percentage of highly polarized people are also the loudest, politically speaking, Nyhan said. “They consume a disproportionate amount of the news and the parties are most responsive to them because they’re the most politically engaged,” he said.
And that can present some problems of its own. Take, for instance, the influence that a vocal minority can have on the people closest to them. There’s some evidence that in-person conversations are actually more powerful polarizers than any TV station or website. In one study from 2018, the polarizing effects of talking to people who share your partisan political bent were more than twice as large as the effects of consuming politically biased media. Our coffee dates may be more effective conveyors of fake news than our Facebooks.
CORRECTION (Oct. 8, 2019, 5:15 p.m.): A previous version of this article misstated where Brendan Nyhan works. He is a professor at Dartmouth College, not the University of Michigan.

Then the rest of the game happened.
The 24-0 lead the Packers built by the early third quarter slowly fell apart — until, with 10:29 left on the clock, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott got the ball with a chance to cut it to just one score. Had Prescott not promptly thrown his third interception of the game, the Packers might not have left Dallas with their fourth win in five games. The Packers now sit alone atop the NFC North — but a primetime national TV audience saw a performance that continued a bizarre seasonlong pattern: a dominant first quarter and a dormant fourth.
So far this year, the Packers have scored 42 first-quarter points (ranked third in the NFL), 40 second-quarter points (seventh) and 28 third-quarter points (12th). But they’ve scored only 9 points in the fourth quarter (30th). That makes them the fifth-most volatile scoring team1 in the NFL, in terms of scoring by quarter. And of the top 10, they’re the only team whose scoring variance comes from faltering in the fourth quarter.2
Why are the Packers starting so fast and finishing so slow? Because that’s how Rodgers is playing. Pro-Football-Reference.com’s splits show that Rodgers’s quarter-by-quarter production has mirrored his offense’s output:

If he existed all by himself, First-Quarter Aaron Rodgers would own or share the best completion rate, interception rate, passer rating, raw yards per attempt and adjusted yards per attempt in the NFL. Fourth-Quarter Aaron Rodgers would rank 25th, 22nd, 32nd, 32nd and 33rd, respectively.
Though there’s been quite a bit of analysis around whether Rodgers is actually clutch, being consistently bad in the fourth quarter is a new thing for him. Across his career, Rodgers’s quarter-by-quarter rate stats have been quite steady. Looking further at situational breakdowns this season, there’s no smoking gun for this recent development: Leading or trailing, on one side of the field or the other, Rodgers’s stats have been steady and solid until late in the game. In fact, the only clear area of concern is from within 10 yards of his opponents’ end zone — and going 6-of-15 on goal-line throws doesn’t explain why he’s put up numbers like the GOAT in five opening periods and a goat in five finales.
It doesn’t seem to be an issue with the supporting cast, either. Running back Aaron Jones had his second 100-plus-yard game of the season against Dallas, and the defense has allowed the eighth-fewest points. Rodgers thinks they’re more than the sum of their parts, too: He said after the game they “have that chemistry” that they’ve “been lacking the last couple of years.”
As FiveThirtyEight staff writer Josh Hermsmeyer explored this offseason, Rodgers’s once-historic levels of efficiency and effectiveness have dropped in recent years, especially with intermediate throws and play-action passes. Several analysts have noted that his longtime tendency to throw the ball away rather than risk throwing an interception now seems to be yielding negative returns. After Week 5, Rodgers ranks 22nd in passer rating, 25th in touchdown rate, 14th in QBR and 15th in net yards per attempt.
In the same postgame comments, Rodgers dismissed concerns about the offense not scoring late against Dallas by emphasizing the team’s win rather than his own numbers. “Days like today aren’t the best statistical games for myself, but I feel like [I] played my best game,” he said. “The way I kept moving and seeing things. I’ve accomplished a lot statistically in this league. I just want to win now.”
But even this doesn’t make sense. If Rodgers were choosing to focus on winning instead of excelling statistically, he wouldn’t be putting up monster first-half numbers and floundering toward the end, when opponents are trying to claw back into the game. If anything, it would be the other way around.
Maybe it’s late-game play-calling under new head coach Matt LaFleur. Maybe Rodgers is mentally struggling to make easy throws and run out the clock after years of winning with deep downfield strikes. Maybe age and injuries are sapping his stamina. Whatever the reason, the high-flying Packers might only be able to maintain their cruising altitude if the defense keeps making up for Rodgers running out of gas.

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): In recent months, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has come a long way in the polls. When she first announced she was considering running for president on Dec. 31, her numbers hovered in the low single digits, but now she’s comfortably in the double digits and poised to steal the number one spot from former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average of the 2020 Democratic primary.
And for the most part, this rise has been accompanied by positive media attention for Warren, with glowing profiles and the like. But is there actually a problem in the way the media covers Warren, i.e., are we too cozy with her candidacy?
clare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): I should state off the bat that this is such an interesting question in part because Warren is SO MANY things: She’s a left-leaning (too left-leaning for most of America?) candidate, the emerging co-front-runner and an older woman running four years after another older woman lost for the Democrats.
That said, I do think we’re seeing the embryonic stages of Warren coverage. She’s currently getting nicer coverage, and I think we haven’t seen as many storylines that delve into questions like: a) Are some of her political stances going to play in swing states, and b) Will her wealth tax work/is it constitutional?
And yeah, I do think that’s going to come later because the media and its dominant demographic group (college-educated white people) are Warren’s base.
natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): For the past several months, I think Warren’s gotten the most friendly stretch of media coverage of any presidential candidate since Barack Obama in 2008. It can change, though. Obama also had phases in 2008 where he got very skeptical coverage. And Warren’s media coverage upon her announcement wasn’t very friendly, for instance. In fact, much of it centered on her decision to take a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry.
clare.malone: What do you think the first wave of skeptical Warren coverage will be, Nate? Will it be health care stuff, a la “is it too left for the white non-college-educated voter in the Upper Midwest the Democrats need to win back?”
natesilver: I mean the first wave was POCAHONTAS and LIKABILITY.
So we’re talking about the second wave.
clare.malone: OK, I STAND CORRECTED.
What’s the second wave?
natesilver: THANKS CLARE.
I mean, we might see POCAHONTAS and LIKABILITY/ELECTABILITY and the TOO FAR TO THE LEFT arguments again.
clare.malone: I think “too far to the left” will become the next big thing for her. I wonder if that won’t become a more explicit line from Biden in the next debate.
natesilver: And in some sense, that’s a fairer critique. There’s a decent amount of evidence that candidates who are too far to the left or right are a bit less electable than candidates who are moderate. Meanwhile, there’s not as much evidence that women are less electable or less likable, and those critiques are often fairly gendered.
perry (Perry Bacon Jr., senior writer): I tend to think that a candidate with this kind of surge in the polls is going to get good media coverage no matter what, because the political press is obsessed with the horse race.
I also think part of what we are seeing is that the press, and I would argue to some extent college-educated people in general — especially white, college-educated liberals — have gotten more liberal on issues like racial and gender inequality. In terms of media coverage, that has meant that coverage around Warren’s DNA test was harsh, but so has been the coverage of Biden allegedly touching women without their consent or that of his comments highlighting his positive relationships with segregationist senators. I think some of the coverage around “electability” has been maybe not as been as anti-Warren as it could have been for this same reason. Electability often gets cast as the idea that a woman or a minority can’t win — so my guess is some in the press have downplayed the issue a bit for that reason.
sarahf: So David Byler of the Washington Post wrote a piece last Thursday arguing: 1) There have been some press-worthy developments in Warren’s campaign as of late, i.e., she’s on the tails of Biden (and maybe overtaking him). So that’s huge and one reason she’s getting so much coverage; but 2) Warren is also the kind of candidate journalists love to cover — because she’s running on policy ideas, “rather than issues such as electability and style that they see as lesser or maybe even distasteful.”
How do we reconcile Nos. 1 & 2? And what do we make of that claim in No. 2?
clare.malone: Yeah, I mean, I do think her steady rise in the polls is grounds for worthwhile coverage.
And I do think the fact that Democrats might elect another older white woman is interesting! You could read it as a middle finger to Trump just as much as a problem of electability.
natesilver: I’m not sure it’s that complicated? Journalists are disproportionately college educated, so campaigns that are attuned to a college-educated audience are probably going to resonate more with journalists in all sorts of tangible and intangible ways.
Pete Buttigieg has gotten pretty good coverage too, maybe the most favorable after Warren’s. And his supporters are super college educated.
Kamala Harris (also lots of college-educated support) hasn’t gotten great coverage lately, but she’s still probably gotten better coverage than Biden or Bernie Sanders, who are doing MUCH better than she is in the polls!
sarahf: That’s fair. But remember that piece from the New York Times earlier this year that argued that the Democratic electorate on Twitter had an outsized voice in the primary compared to the actual Democratic electorate? Do we think there’s evidence of that happening here?
natesilver: I think that’s also a factor. Journalists spend a lot time on Twitter. And Twitter ********loves******* ❤️ Elizabeth Warren.
clare.malone: I mean, Biden’s team loves to talk about this: how their strategy is to give voice to the people not on Twitter — largely older voters, voters of color or voters without a college education.
natesilver: I think those critiques from Biden’s team are mostly valid. And you see it in the polling coverage. I’d argue that polls that show Warren tied or ahead of Biden generate tons of coverage. The ones that still show Biden ahead don’t.
clare.malone: I agree.
natesilver: In some sense, that’s why I focus the most on the way that polls are covered.
It’s complicated to determine, objectively, whether Warren has more thorough policy ideas than her competition. And in some sense, I’d have no problem with her getting “better” coverage if she does.
perry: Yeah, I’m not sure a content analysis of a full year of media coverage would reveal that it’s been more favorable to Warren than, say, Buttigieg or Harris or even Biden. In fact, I’d argue the electability and “eliminating private insurance coverage” has not been great for Warren, and that latter story has been covered pretty extensively.
But I do think that a poll of Twitter users would be way more pro-Warren and anti-Biden than the polls are. And I think that makes me constantly remember to use Twitter for news updates, not to gauge where the electorate is.
clare.malone: Agree with that, Perry. The interesting thing is, Biden isn’t all that conservative of a Democrat.
He’s decently liberal!
natesilver: But polls are fairly simple, objective facts. So when you see certain types of polls hyped up and others ignored, that’s a relatively clean indication of the biases of the moment.
sarahf: Which polls do you think are being ignored Nate?
Biden just got one good poll in South Carolina, and it got some coverage, no?
natesilver: Really? Biden got a pretty good (Fox News) poll in Wisconsin this weekend, and it got almost no coverage.
The Morning Consult poll that still shows Biden well ahead of Warren nationally gets very little coverage. The HarrisX polls that show the same thing don’t, either.
clare.malone: Biden’s polling news cycles have tended to focus more on general election head-to-heads, I think.
natesilver: Yeah, Biden’s general election polls do get some coverage, and they probably shouldn’t! Because those polls don’t mean all that much at this stage! But early primary polls are reasonably predictive, and if you were just reading Twitter, you’d get the sense that Biden had crashed. He hasn’t really though — he’s fallen by just a couple of points in the averages, while Warren has risen a lot.
clare.malone: We like to cover a moving car rather than an idling one.
The royal media “we,” I mean.
perry: The main issue for me in analyzing the race is that many of the people I follow on Twitter for non-political reasons — say, for their expertise on economics, gender or race — tend to like Warren and not Biden. I don’t even think Obama in ‘08 was thought of as the “candidate of the experts” like Warren is because Clinton was also fairly well-liked by wonky people. So we have this weird dichotomy, and I have to constantly check the polls and be like, “Is Biden still doing well? Yes, he is.”
natesilver: Another element here is that both Biden and Sanders are old news, whereas Warren is a newer and fresher story. Also, some of Sanders’s staffers and some of his supporters are not exactly the nicest people to the press.
clare.malone: Some of this comes back to the emerging progressive movement in the party, though, and much of the base isn’t really aware of this. Lots of Democratic voters liked, and now want a return to an Obama-style, establishment Democratic Party. They want to reset the clock. But the politically tuned-in people and policy experts of the Democratic Party have already moved like five ticks over on the progressivism odometer in the last four years.
There’s a dissonance that’s powerful, and you see it in news coverage.
sarahf: But to Clare’s point, what really surprised me in Perry’s piece on why Harris isn’t doing better is that the candidates who have made claims to Obama’s legacy (think Harris, Cory Booker, Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke) aren’t doing better. Combined, they’re polling at 14 percent in national polls. As Perry wrote, this is pretty strong evidence “suggesting that Democratic voters aren’t looking for an Obama re-run.”
perry: It is worth considering that Warren is actually running a better campaign than Biden? Like, the idea of releasing a fairly-aggressive leftward policy plan each week or so was pretty savvy. I do think Warren has more aggressive plans than Biden — and that creates news coverage, too. Warren also was among the first Democratic presidential candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment. So the fact that Warren is gaining on Biden is not entirely shocking.
clare.malone: That’s a very interesting question … I think you can’t say Biden is running a terrible campaign given the way they were able to ride out the summer’s pretty bad bumps. But Warren’s campaign has had a very solid communications ethos and effort since the very beginning — I’d argue since they ran that “angry woman” last September.


Brett Kavanaugh was allowed to be angry. Dr. Ford wasn’t. Women grow up hearing that being angry makes us unattractive. Well, today, I’m angry – and I own it. I plan to use that anger to take back the House, take back the Senate, & put Democrats in charge. Are you with me? pic.twitter.com/c9DebKTQEV
— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 30, 2018

The Warren campaign has a knack for knowing the sort of blend of righteous anger and wonkery that suits them best.
natesilver: But I think Warren sometimes gets credit for being apolitical when that’s sort of bullshit, and she’s just as much of a politician as anyone else. Almost all of her plans are pretty well-calibrated to appeal to the Democratic base.
Maybe it just so happens that’s what she believes, but there’s not a lot of heterodoxy in what she’s offering.
But there’s also stuff like Warren being against the expansion of nuclear power. I hesitate to characterize the views of entire groups of scientists, but my understanding is that most scientists who are concerned about climate change would support expanding nuclear power. Warren doesn’t support it though, probably because it isn’t very popular among Democrats.
clare.malone: She’s a first mover on a lot of issues.
She’s not afraid to be out there, and I think that’s unique, given how conservative a lot of national politicians are.
perry: I agree that Warren is not taking stands that are going to piss off a lot of Democrats. She is quite political, I agree. I just think she might have arrived at a strategy that has worked well: being extra to the left and framing herself as “having a plan.”
natesilver: It’s smart politics! Part of smart politics is doing things that the press will like!
One of the most depressing parts of covering primary elections is that kissing the media’s ass and providing lots of access to the candidate is probably very “worth it” in terms of the coverage that candidates receive.
clare.malone: Ah. I think that we’ve landed in interesting territory re: access.
Biden’s campaign has gotten media people irritated by not letting him talk more. He just doesn’t do a lot of TV or a lot of on the record, regular media sitdowns.
He even got called out this summer by the hosts of The Breakfast Club (a New York City radio show ) for offering a surrogate when other candidates were appearing directly.
natesilver: And Biden had a pretty friendly relationship with the press as VP.
perry: Buttigieg did the media access thing hard early on in his campaign, and I thought that would really take off for him. It helped him get that initial burst but that was it. I’m kind of surprised by it — I thought Buttigieg was rising the media wave just right.
natesilver: Maybe he’s still overperforming right now, Perry?
I mean, he’s probably in fourth place in the polls now.
A distant fourth, granted, but it’s not bad for the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to be beating all these senators.
clare.malone: I think he’s gotten slammed by the fact that we only really talk about it as a three-person race of late.
Fair or not, he could still get an Iowa storyline, and that could buoy him.
natesilver: It’s a two-person race, Clare.
(TROLL BAIT!!!)
clare.malone: I will let the trolls take that.
But … here’s a question: Are we maybe more aware and, therefore, more OK with talking about these media coverage biases than we were in 2016?
Or was it the same then, too?
I ask because I’ve noticed a bit more meta-awareness by the media in the way we’re covering things. But unfortunately, people who get their news from Twitter and people who get their news from, say, TV are so disconnected by medium — and probably lifestyle — that they get a fragmented sense of the race. (And, obviously, this problem can be exacerbated if reporters tend to get more of their news from Twitter than TV.)
All of this is to say: I think we’ll probably continue to see tougher coverage of Biden in part because of some of the biases we’ve talked about in the media, but also because he’s just running a campaign that, at times, seems more tentative and conservative in its approach. And that gives room for doubt and perhaps induces more reporting on an imminent polling slump or whatever.
natesilver: Maybe there’s more meta-awareness, as Clare puts it. But I think it’s hard for journalists to recognize just how wrapped up everything is in the horse-race narrative. When a candidate is rising in the polls, everything is deemed to be good news for them.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Two weeks ago, when the Wall Street Journal broke the news about the whistleblower complaint, cable news increased its coverage of Biden, but not online news outlets. But last week, that changed. As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry against Trump and the acting director of national intelligence testified in a public hearing in front of Congress, the share of online news stories that mention Biden also surged. Biden was mentioned in more cable news clips and online news stories last week than all other 2020 Democratic candidates combined, according to data from the TV News Archive1 and Media Cloud.2

Includes all candidates that qualify as “major” in FiveThirtyEight’s rubric. Each network’s daily news coverage is chopped up into 15-second clips, and each clip that includes a candidate’s name is counted as one mention. For both cable and online news, our search queries look for an exact match for each candidate’s name, except for Julián Castro, for whom our search query is “Julian Castro” OR “Julián Castro.” Media Cloud searches use two of the database’s publication lists: “top online news” and “digital native” publications. Percentages are calculated as the number of stories or clips mentioning each candidate divided by the number of stories or clips mentioning any of the 2020 Democratic contenders for that week.

And it seems like the media isn’t only mentioning Biden more — it’s also mentioning everyone else less. Last week, all of the other Democratic candidates who are still running for president were mentioned less than the week prior, and overall the non-Biden candidates were mentioned in more than a third fewer cable news clips and online news stories compared to the week before. All this suggests that the impeachment story could eat up a lot of the media oxygen that would otherwise have been dedicated to the Democratic primary. We’ll be watching the numbers in the coming weeks to see to what extent Biden continues to be wrapped up in the story of Trump’s impeachment inquiry and how much that affects the amount of coverage the other candidates receive.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-supreme-court-heading-for-a-conservative-revolution/,2019-10-07,,,features,"Oct. 7, 2019",Is The Supreme Court Heading For A Conservative Revolution?,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,FiveThirtyEight,Supreme Court,"In the final weeks of the Supreme Court’s last term, the court’s conservative majority overruled two decades-old cases. The cases made headlines — not because their content was especially attention-grabbing, but because of what they may signal for the future. In both cases, liberal justices sounded the alarm on the threats they saw to other precedents. Justice Stephen Breyer even wrote in one dissent that he was left wondering “which cases the Court will overrule next.”
Breyer and the other liberal justices may soon get an answer on just how far the conservative justices are willing to go. The Supreme Court is back in session today, and it is already facing a docket full of high-profile cases, including several in which the justices have been asked to reexamine and potentially overrule past decisions. On Friday, for instance, the court announced it will review a restrictive Louisiana abortion law that’s nearly identical to a Texas law struck down by the justices in 2016. That case will be a particularly closely-watched test of whether the conservative justices are willing to start reversing liberal precedents on abortion rights. Generally, once a precedent is established, the justices say they’ll adhere to it, meaning that in cases involving hot topics like abortion or affirmative action, they’ll hand down a ruling that’s in line with what past justices have decided. But, of course, as we saw in the previous term, this isn’t always the case. Justices do sometimes overrule precedents or change them in substantial ways, and studies have shown that when that happens, their ideological preferences influence which precedents they affirm or override.
This appears to be true of the Roberts court as well, but according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of Supreme Court decisions dating back to 1953, his court so far actually hasn’t been any more likely than previous courts to alter precedents. But there’s a key distinction: When the Roberts court does break with past rulings, it tends to do so by the slimmest of margins. Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the vast majority of precedent-altering cases have been decided by a narrow one-vote majority — and most of those cases have split along ideological lines. That’s a departure from previous courts, where there was typically greater consensus when overturning precedent. And it might also signal that Roberts — who has said that ideologically divided, 5-4 decisions undermine the court’s reputation — is actually more comfortable with divisive rulings than he lets on.
On the other hand, concern for the court’s reputation as an impartial institution might mean Roberts will move more cautiously than some of his conservative colleagues would like. “Roberts is in something of a bind,” said James Spriggs, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. “There might be plenty of cases he wants to overrule. But as chief justice, he’d prefer to make big changes with a consensus, and that might lead him to vote in ways that are in tension with his ideological views.”
The Roberts court is already overturning precedents without consensus
In a system where unelected judges wield an enormous amount of power, the principle of adherence to precedent helps ensure that a single judge can’t simply decide he doesn’t like the rules and change them. And Supreme Court justices do so sparingly, perhaps in part to avoid the impression that they’re taking the law into their own hands. According to our analysis of precedent-altering decisions in the Supreme Court Database,1 they make up just about 2 percent of the total decisions handed down under Roberts, Rehnquist, Burger and Warren.
But even if these types of cases are rare, the Roberts court is handling them differently. As the table below shows, about 70 percent of the precedent-altering cases during Roberts’ tenure were decided by a thin one-vote margin, and only 14 percent were unanimous. That’s a big contrast with previous courts, where one-vote majorities only decided between 20 and 31 percent of precedent-altering cases.
One obvious culprit for this trend is the growing polarization dividing the court’s left and right flanks. For over a decade, Justice Anthony Kennedy was the court’s “swing” justice, which meant that even though he was still quite conservative, he would sometimes pivot and join the liberal justices on issues like gay rights. Nevertheless, more than half (62 percent) of the Roberts court’s precedent-altering decisions have gone in a conservative direction, as coded by the Supreme Court Database.2 And in rulings decided by one vote, the conservatives also usually came out on top. Five conservative justices (including Kennedy) were in the majority in two-thirds of these decisions; the liberal bloc, meanwhile, was only in the majority 20 percent of the time. Now with Kennedy retired, Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh (Kennedy’s replacement) are at the center of the court, which means that liberal precedents may be in even more danger.
This pattern is troubling to some, in part because it signals that the current court is willing to make big changes without a consensus, which was rarer under previous chief justices. Leah Litman, a law professor at the University of Michigan, told me that she’s concerned that these types of decisions “could undermine the court’s legitimacy.” Chief Justice Earl Warren, for instance, famously negotiated with his more conservative colleagues to obtain a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education because he thought it would give the decision greater authority. Ideologically divided decisions in high-profile cases run a higher risk of being seen as politically motivated — such as when the Roberts court ruled that the government can’t restrict political spending by corporations.
Some liberal precedents could be in trouble
Of course, none of this bodes well for more liberal precedents on issues like abortion or affirmative action, since there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that if justices do overturn a precedent, they’re more likely to dismantle one they disagree with ideologically. “Conservatives will generally uphold conservative precedents and overturn liberal precedents, and liberals will do the opposite,” said Jeffrey Segal, a political science professor at Stony Brook University and the co-author of a book on the Supreme Court and precedent.
But precedents aren’t overturned only because of the justices’ ideological leanings — other factors play a role, too. Sometimes there are philosophical differences, as in the case of Justice Clarence Thomas, who is notoriously skeptical of loyalty to precedent for precedent’s sake alone. In a concurring opinion a few months ago, he wrote, “When faced with a demonstrably erroneous precedent, my rule is simple: We should not follow it.” Thomas is not necessarily alone in this regard, although he is unusually open about his views. Other justices have also varied on how much they seem to lean on precedent. According to one study using data from the Burger and Rehnquist courts, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was more likely to show deference to precedent than Kennedy. The stature of the precedent in question can matter, too. For instance, one study found that justices were more likely to overrule a precedent that they disagreed with if it was also still active and influential, as was the case when the conservative justices overturned a longstanding ruling involving public sector unions in 2018.
There may also be moments when a wing of the court feels more emboldened to overturn precedents — like when the court’s ideological center of gravity shifts. In 2006, for instance, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, then the court’s “swing” justice, was replaced by Samuel Alito, a reliable conservative. The following term, the court issued five precedent-altering decisions — more than in any other single year since — including a case where the conservatives voted to allow a ban on a specific method of abortion for the first time. Ryan Black, a political science professor at Michigan State University, said it’s possible that this year could be similar. “It’s the same pattern — the median moved right, and the conservative wing of the court is stronger and more homogenous, so it’s not unreasonable to expect they might want to strike while the iron is hot,” he said.
But Roberts may emerge as a defender of precedent
There’s a possibility, though, that Roberts will emerge as an unlikely savior of liberal precedents — or at least work to postpone their demise. Given his pivotal role at the court’s center and as the chief justice, he’s likely to be more influenced by concerns about the court’s institutional reputation and his own judicial legacy at a moment when public opinion of the court is more polarized than at any other point in the past 20 years. And that could lead to some unexpected alliances with the liberal justices, in this term and beyond.
Take a case from last term, where the court had the opportunity to overturn a 1997 ruling that gives federal agencies the power to interpret their own regulations — a longstanding conservative bogeyman. Instead of voting with the conservatives to overturn it, Roberts cast his lot in with the liberals and instead voted to narrow the precedent’s scope. Litman told me that the liberals may similarly work with Roberts this term if they see an opening to avoid sweeping changes to precedents they support.
But Roberts could also join his fellow conservatives to start overturning more high-profile liberal precedents, and if he does, some experts say he risks jeopardizing the court’s status as a neutral arbiter. According to Spriggs’s research, people are less likely to think favorably of a narrowly decided, precedent-altering ruling than a unanimous one. “Consensus makes the ruling seem more neutral and less partisan,” he said.
Then again, more recent studies by Michael Salamone, a political science professor at Washington State University, have suggested that when the issue is controversial, the size of the majority might not matter very much. In his experiments, he found that if the issue was something high-profile, like abortion or gun control, the case’s margin didn’t matter — people’s views of the ruling were guided by their politics on the issue.
Roberts is an avowed skeptic of political science, so chances are he’s not looking to these studies for guidance. And regardless of how he decides to approach upholding precedent this term, it seems safe to say that at least some precedents are likely to fall by the wayside, given the court’s recent track record. But it’s also entirely possible that the Supreme Court’s long-awaited conservative revolution also may not be coming as quickly as some on the court’s right wing would like.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-connecticut-suns-defense-has-them-on-the-cusp-of-a-wnba-championship/,2019-10-07,,,features,"Oct. 4, 2019",The Connecticut Sun Is On The Cusp Of A WNBA Championship,Howard Megdal,FiveThirtyEight,WNBA,"It is easy to get lost in the individual and team-wide offensive brilliance of the Connecticut Sun. There’s Jonquel Jones, currently fourth in WNBA history in true shooting percentage, who just enjoyed a 32-point outing in Game 2 of the WNBA Finals. There’s Courtney Williams, who scored 26 in Game 1, with a signature midrange jumpshot, and there’s Alyssa Thomas, who combines physicality with an array of trick shots around the hoop to score in bunches.
But the Sun, who are now just two wins from a WNBA championship after defeating the Washington Mystics on Tuesday night, 99-87, made that final leap into the league’s elite with a defense that’s found another level this postseason. As with their offense, it is a collaborative effort.
It began, Sun coach Curt Miller said, with a team meeting between him and a few of his veterans.
“It was a little past the halfway point,” Miller said. “And basically what they were saying was, ‘You don’t have to be conservative with us. There’s a synergy that we’ve played together for so long and trust each other.’ And that core group gave us the confidence [in] the second half of the season to pick our places to try to be more disruptive.”
2019 has seen a significant improvement in Connecticut’s defensive rating, from 101.4 points allowed per 100 possessions in 2018 to 96.8 in 2019. Come playoff time, that’s dropped even further, despite the improved competition: Through five playoff games — two against the greatest regular-season offense in WNBA history, the Mystics — their mark is 94.8.
So how do they do it? Similar to how they’ve established their offensive success, Miller’s Sun attack opponents on the defensive end in a variety of ways, some of them difficult to practice for or counteract.
There’s Courtney Williams, for instance. Just 5-foot-8, she may seem like a defensive liability for the Sun. Instead, per Synergy, she’s allowed the fewest points per possession (0.62) among players this postseason with at least 50 defensive possessions, and players she’s guarding are shooting 31 percent in the playoffs.
“All I’m saying is I got robbed for second team all-defense,” said Williams, who was not nearly finished with all she was saying. She then asked for the numbers to be repeated.
“Stats don’t lie, bro,” Williams concluded. “Stats don’t lie.”
Teammate Jasmine Thomas, upon hearing this, wryly inquired, “That’s a sample size of how many, one?”
But even if the horizon is extended beyond the playoffs, Williams’s defense is worthy of recognition — and it plays a critical role in how the Sun have improved at that end. Williams — a player Miller said simply wasn’t prepared to contribute on defense when she came into the league in 2016 — finished with a steal rate of 2.4 percent in 2019, almost double her 2018 mark, and a 1.2 percent block rate, especially high considering she is among the shortest players in the league. And she grabs more defensive rebounds than anyone in the league shorter than 6 feet.
“Where she’s come from understanding schemes, understanding the systems that people use in this league and then just the commitment at that end, the defensive end’s been Courtney’s biggest growth,” Miller said. “And I don’t think she’s done.”
But Williams is merely one of the Sun players who disrupt opponents by jumping into passing lanes — nine current Sun players had steal rates of 2 percent or better during the regular season. First among those, at 3.3 percent, is Alyssa Thomas, the team leader in minutes this regular season and a versatile 6-foot-2 wing who guards everyone on the floor — from the 6-foot-5 Elena Delle Donne to the 5-foot-7 Kristi Toliver. As a result, Miller hasn’t taken her out of the game for a second of this WNBA Finals.
“As she walked in the locker room, I said, I am going to take you out at some point,” Miller said following Game 2. “But she just is so important to us.”
An example of her versatility came in Game 1, when she not only helped limit entry passes to Delle Donne, who took only 13 shots, but also switched onto Toliver in the final seconds of the third quarter. Toliver has made her living in the WNBA by effectively creating her own shot against the defense, but Thomas stayed firmly between Toliver and the basket as the guard tried several different fakes and maneuvers. She finally forced up a shot that Thomas swatted away as the buzzer sounded.
“We switched and I’ve watched a lot of video on her,” Thomas said of Toliver. “I know her tendencies, what she likes to do and it’s just about contesting. I know she’s not going to try to drive past me, so I just tried to keep my hands high and not allow her to get any space or a three off on me.”
Miller identified Thomas as the defensive counterpart to Williams on offense; it’s less about scheming and more about trusting his versatile player to understand where she needs to be at any given moment. The approach has worked, especially in Game 1, when Thomas helped keep the Sun in the game with five steals.
And should an opposing scorer manage to get past Thomas, Jones is waiting. That wouldn’t have meant much as recently as last year, when Miller identified Jones improving on the defensive end as the most critical change necessary for the Sun to ascend to a title. But for her part, Jones took up the challenge with gusto, and after leading the WNBA in block rate this regular season at 6.1 percent, she’s gotten the better of bigs like Nneka Ogwumike, Candace Parker and Emma Meesseman this postseason, with three blocks on Tuesday night alone.
“He challenged me coming into the season, and I think that I’ve gotten better at it,” Jones said of her defense.
The league agreed and put Jones on the all-defensive first team, along with Jasmine Thomas. Alyssa Thomas made the second team. And for all of her skepticism about playoff sample sizes, Jasmine Thomas is just behind Williams with 0.66 points allowed per possession, second among all postseason defenders with a minimum of 50 possessions played. Furthermore, players she’s guarding are shooting just 32 percent.
Her role on the team, as the lone veteran over 30 (she turned 30 just this week), is to keep her teammates organized at the defensive end, just as she runs things on offense as the starting point guard.
“They make open shots,” Thomas said of the Mystics. “If there’s anything about Washington that stands out, is they make open shots. So when you’re in rotation, when you are trying to help off in certain areas, they find each other, and they make open shots. So it does present its own challenges, and when we do get them to miss, when we do get them to make an occasional turnover — they don’t turn the ball over much — we have to capitalize off of those possessions.”
If the Sun can do this just twice more, they’ll be WNBA champions. And in the process, it might exorcise what Miller views as an unfair knock against his coaching — that he is an offense-first coach.
“I’ve never been given any credit as a defensive coach, through all of the championship success at the collegiate level,” Miller said. “So I feel a little bit vindicated that our defense has been better throughout this run.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-warrens-rise-in-the-polls/,2019-10-07,,,features,"Oct. 7, 2019",What’s Behind Elizabeth Warren’s Rise In The Polls?,Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren has come a long way in the polls since the early days of her 2020 presidential campaign. Back in April, she was polling in the mid single digits nationally, but she now leads a number of national and early-state polls. And based on polls from September and August, Warren has expanded her support in a few overlapping directions — making inroads with groups and categories of voters she was previously struggling with. The result is that she is now positioned as the leading alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden. Here’s a look at where Warren has made inroads, so far:
Warren is appealing to more moderate voters now, too
Along with Sen. Bernie Sanders, Warren has long been a favorite among more liberal voters. And since June, she’s actually been the top choice among very liberal voters, according to polling from Quinnipiac University. Now, however, there’s evidence she’s picking up support from more moderate voters, too. In the latest Quinnipiac national survey, Warren not only inched ahead of Biden in overall support from Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents, 27 percent to 25 percent, but she also beat him for the first time in Quinnipiac’s polling among somewhat liberal voters, capturing 30 percent of that group to Biden’s 19 percent. (She was also the clear second choice among moderate or conservative voters, although Biden still had a 10-point lead there.)
Earlier in September, I wrote that it was good for Warren that she was doing so well among very liberal voters, but that it probably wasn’t enough to carve out a path to the nomination as the Democratic Party is roughly evenly split between liberals and moderates. But now, it seems as if Warren’s appeal is broadening beyond her ideological base of very liberal supporters.

Quinnipiac isn’t the only pollster who found this, either. Monmouth University’s September national survey found that Warren led with 37 percent of the vote from liberal voters and was also in second place among moderate or conservative respondents with 20 percent support — 10 points behind Biden’s 30 percent. This marked an uptick of 4 percentage points among these moderate or conservative voters since Monmouth’s August poll. Additionally, the latest YouGov/Economist national poll pegged Warren as the first choice for 15 percent of moderates — some distance behind Biden’s 30 percent, though still in second place. But this was still about twice the level of Warren’s support among moderates in late August.
Warren is finally starting to make inroads with voters without a college degree
For the past couple of months, Warren has been the leading candidate for college-educated voters, particularly white ones,1 but there are now signs she’s garnering support from voters who aren’t college educated, too. This is important for Warren because a plurality of Democratic voters are white voters without a college degree, and they currently form a key constituency for Biden and Sanders. And in Quinnipiac’s latest survey, Warren had 26 percent support among non-college whites, which put her in a near-tie with Biden at 27 percent and ahead of Sanders’s 19 percent. By comparison, in Quinnipiac’s late-August survey, Warren had 20 percent to Biden’s 30 percent among non-college whites and was roughly tied with Sanders, who had 19 percent support among that group.
Fox News also found a slight improvement in Warren’s support among white voters without a college degree in its September survey: 19 percent support, compared to 15 percent in August, and she now sits just 5 percentage points behind Biden. Granted, these aren’t huge shifts we’re talking about — and we should be cautious with reading too much into the crosstabs because they have larger margins of error than the overall sample — but the trend has been consistent across a number of recent polls. Monmouth also found Warren’s support among voters (of all races) without a four-year degree went up from 17 percent in August to 24 percent in late September.
And if Warren is gaining among white voters who don’t have a college degree, it’s likely to the detriment of Biden and Sanders, who are the only other candidates who get at least double-digit support from this group. This is especially important in light of the fact that Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote in the Democratic primary, are predominantly white and, as a result, have a large share of white voters without a college degree. In fact, if we look at Democratic primary exit polls from 2016, half of Iowa caucus-goers weren’t college graduates, and 40 percent of New Hampshire primary voters fell into that category as well.2 So if Warren can keep improving her standing among whites without a college degree, it could help her chances in the first two contests, which could potentially catapult her to outright front-runner status early in 2020.
Warren is also winning over voters who aren’t white
Arguably the biggest threat to Warren’s chances at the nomination has been just how white her support is. She has consistently had low support among nonwhite voters, especially African Americans, who make up anywhere from 20 to 25 percent of the Democratic electorate. But polls now suggest Warren may be, at last, gaining traction. Quinnipiac’s past two national polls showed Warren’s support among black voters nearly doubled from 10 to 19 percent, and the most recent YouGov/Economist survey found her at 15 percent among African Americans compared to 9 percent in its final August poll. And Monmouth’s late September survey found her at 20 percent among nonwhites more broadly, up from 14 percent in August.
It’s worth noting, however, that Fox News’s August (13 percent) and September (11 percent) surveys showed virtually no change in Warren’s support among nonwhites. And though she might be eating into Biden’s support elsewhere, two new polls in South Carolina show Biden doing far, far better than Warren among black voters. A Winthrop University poll found Biden winning 46 percent of black voters to Warren’s 9 percent, while a Fox News survey had Biden at 50 percent compared to Warren’s 8 percent among that group. So while Warren has started to make inroads among nonwhite voters, we shouldn’t rush to overstate her improvement. She still has plenty of work to do to expand her support.
Warren is also maybe winning over some former Harris backers
This theory may be on less solid footing than the other ones I’ve floated so far, but I venture that at least some of Warren’s gains have come at the expense of Sen. Kamala Harris’s support, too. If we look at the last two months of national polls and split them into three different periods (each spanning three weeks) and calculate the polling average for Warren and Harris using polls from pollsters with at least a B- rating, according to FiveThirtyEight’s pollster ratings, you can see Warren and Harris have pretty clearly moved in opposite directions. Warren has moved from the mid-teens to the low 20s, while Harris has fallen from the high single digits to just the mid single digits.

And one reason to think that some of Harris’s supporters have moved into Warren’s camp is that they have tended to name Warren as their top second-choice candidate. In part, this is probably because there is some demographic overlap in their support — both candidates have a fair amount of backing from college-educated voters and more progressive voters.


To be clear, Biden is still leading in the polls, but the distance between him and Warren has narrowed considerably. And so while we’ll be keeping an eye on how things develop, it does seem like Warren has improved her position from where it was in April. She has done this, in part, by starting to build support from a broader coalition that includes more moderate voters, less-educated voters and some nonwhite voters, as well as some voters who supported Harris earlier in the campaign. There’s still a lot of progress left for Warren to make, particularly among voters of color, but for now, her trajectory for the 2020 Democratic nomination is moving in the right direction — up.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

More than 3 million years ago
Astronomers say that more than three million years ago, a “colossal beam of energy and radiation” emerged from the centre of the Milky Way, ripping it apart in an explosion. New research suggests this gigantic flare went out into deep space before hitting a long trail of gas extending from nearby galaxies. The researchers say their findings, which will be published in the Astrophysics Journal, “dramatically change” the world’s understanding of Earth’s home galaxy. [Yahoo News UK]
34 minutes
Lots of people want to attend the 50th year of the Glastonbury Music Festival. A record number of people, 2.4 million, registered for the sale of 135,000 tickets for the event, scheduled for next June. And those tickets sold out in only 34 minutes. It was the second-fastest sale in the event’s history, after 2014. [The Guardian]
19 alleged terrorists
Police in Rwanda say that security forces killed 19 people allegedly responsible for an attack on Friday that resulted in 14 people being killed. The initial attack took place in the Musanze district near Volcanoes National Park, a tourist destination for its mountain gorilla sanctuary. Reportedly, Hutu rebels went on a rampage with knives, machetes and stones while looking for food. Police said they tracked down some of the perpetrators near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, killing 19 and arresting five. [BBC News]
$93.5 million
“Joker” scored big at the weekend box-office, earning $93.5 million and easily beating the previous record for an October movie launch ($80 million by “Venom” last year). The movie is directed by Todd Phillips and stars Joaquin Phoenix in the title role. Many critics worried it could inspire violence, and some movie theaters put in extra security for the film’s release, as well as banning costumes and face masks. [Variety]
47,000 additional square feet
After three years of construction, a summer shutdown and $450 million in changes, the Museum of Modern Art will reopen in two weeks with about 47,000 additional square feet of space and a new vision of where, and how, to display its collection. Jason Farago, the New York Times’ art critic, explains how the famed institution’s philosophy of curation has changed, including much shorter rotations of exhibited works. Themes like “German Expressionism”, “Dada” or even “Pop” have been removed from galleries, which now highlight ideas like “Design for Modern Life” or “violence and internal exile around the 1970s.” [The New York Times]
1,102 pound pig
The super pigs in the movie “Okja” were the size of hippos. But those were fictional. One farm deep in southern China is getting close to that vision after raising a pig clocking in at 1,102 pounds, or 500 kilograms. That’s four times the normal weight. The extra-large pig is part of a wider effort to breed giant swine. Both small and large farms are trying to increase the size of pigs to raise profits and deal with a supply shortage that has led to record prices. [Bloomberg]

Reporters routinely ask players what they did during their time away, and players in turn talk about the weight they’ve lost, the muscle they’ve gained, or the skills they’ve tried to bolster. James Harden is no different, having apparently added a one-legged, running 3-point shot to his arsenal, which was perhaps the league’s most dangerous to begin with.
The unorthodox jumper is merely the latest innovation Harden has unveiled since the start of his MVP-winning 2017 season. On some level, that underscores the dilemma Harden faces. The creative lefty and the Houston Rockets organization — currently facing as much uncertainty as they have in years, between a fraught political controversy and the looming onset of what feels like a make-or-break Russell Westbrook era — could soon run out of tricks and toys to get over the NBA title hump. And with that in mind, this season may represent the best remaining shot for Harden and his teammates to reach the promised land.
There are a handful of reasons to wonder whether this might be Harden’s last good chance for a ring in Houston. First, it’s simply not practical to assume that, at age 30, he’ll keep finding new ways to score this efficiently. In 2016-17, the lefty singlehandedly drew more 3-point shooting fouls than any NBA team; then, realizing that officials would be far less gracious with their whistles the following year, he nearly tripled the number of stepback triples he attempted the following season, according to data from Second Spectrum.1
In the 2018-19 campaign, he introduced a controversial sidestep maneuver to generate more space on jumpers, and this year he seems to have added a running, one-legged variation on that. Through each of the tweaks and additions, Harden has still been dominant, with a true shooting percentage of .600 or better in seven of the past eight seasons, including each of the past three. But simply assuming that he’ll be able to keep up this pace while averaging 30 points per game doesn’t seem all that wise.
Yes, Harden has been incredibly healthy over the course of his career and has never missed more than 10 games in a season.2 But for all the relative stability the Rockets’ front office has enjoyed, the last couple of months have seemed a bit rockier than usual. Fourth-year coach Mike D’Antoni, the 2017 NBA Coach of the Year, will enter the final year of his deal without an extension. (Owner Tilman Fertitta shared a surprising level of detail about the negotiations at one point before later saying that he regretted so much of the conversation about a potential deal becoming public. He’s since said that he expects D’Antoni to be the team’s coach “for a long time.”)
Even more pressing: The team is currently dealing with the fallout from a tweet Rockets general manager Daryl Morey sent last week expressing support for ongoing protests in Hong Kong. It’s estimated that as many as 500 million Chinese citizens watched at least one NBA game last season, and the Rockets have enjoyed enormous support from that massive fanbase since drafting Yao Ming. Fertitta and the NBA both released statements saying that Morey’s tweet — since deleted — did not speak for either the Rockets organization or the league as a whole. And the Chinese Basketball Association, which is chaired by Yao, has suspended its relationship with the Rockets.
It’s far too soon to know what the Rockets’ front office will look like this time next year. But however things shake out, it goes without saying that Houston has a handful of the most analytic-minded folks in the game. D’Antoni, of Seven Seconds or Less fame, was the one who unleashed Harden as a full-time point guard, while Morey is recognized for prioritizing data more than just about any executive in the sport. Losing either one of them would create the possibility of a significant shift in offensive philosophy.
And none of this even addresses the question so many of us are eagerly waiting to assess: whether Westbrook — who is coming off a tough season and was dealt to Houston in exchange for an aging Chris Paul — is an ideal fit with Harden and the other Rockets.
In the most traditional sense, Westbrook doesn’t fit. After all, Houston is a team that plays slowly, takes and makes a ton of threes and, at its best, plays good defense. These are not traits Russ possesses — particularly not in the playoffs. Still, there’s an argument to be made that his speed could get the Rockets easier baskets in transition, thus saving Harden energy and effort needed for clutch possessions in fourth quarters. Unlike Paul, Westbrook isn’t slowing down yet, and he has enough left to get by defenders to not only finish at the rim (at a higher percentage, with far more spacing), but also kick the ball out to 3-point shooters, which he does better than anyone.
Here at FiveThirtyEight, we published a story on Houston hours before Westbrook was dealt, pointing out that our model had the Rockets winning 56 games, with a 30 percent chance of reaching the NBA Finals and a 19 percent probability of winning it all (all of which were the highest marks in the Western Conference at the time). While they wouldn’t have had a shiny new star to showcase like the other contenders, they would have had enjoyed more top-end continuity than those other teams. (Look no further than last year’s Denver Nuggets if you want a sense of why that matters.)
Our model saw the Westbrook deal as further improving Houston’s chances of making the finals and winning the championship: up to 35 percent and 23 percent, respectively. And for what it’s worth, Harden and Westbrook have played together before — just not since 2012,3 or as the lone two stars on a roster. Still, that’s more than can be said for LeBron James and Anthony Davis, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, or Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.
Because of that, it would clearly benefit the Rockets to take care of business this season, before Harden runs out of offensive tricks, before the organization starts feeling pressure to make sweeping changes and before other contenders begin hitting their strides. And if this isn’t the year, it’s fair to wonder when, if at all, it can realistically happen in Harden’s window.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

But our eyes are already turned toward the fifth debate, where things are starting to get a little crowded with seven candidates now qualified. Over the weekend, both Sen. Cory Booker and billionaire activist Tom Steyer earned the last qualifying poll they needed for November’s event, with Steyer making the cut despite having not even appeared in a single debate yet!
When we checked in last week, only the five polling front-runners had made the fifth debate. But since then, a Winthrop University survey released on Oct. 1 gave Booker his third qualifying poll (Steyer already had three), and then a Fox News poll released on Sunday gave both Steyer (4 percent support) and Booker (3 percent support) their fourth qualifying poll. Booker’s inclusion is certainly good news for his chances, as he’s often languished behind the front-runners in the polls. As for Steyer, his prodigious ad spending in the early states, along with the groundwork he laid with his pro-impeachment organization Need to Impeach, seems to have really paid dividends. All of Steyer’s qualifying surveys have come from an early state — either South Carolina or Nevada — whereas the other six qualifiers each have at least one national qualifying poll to their name.
To review, the Democratic National Committee’s qualifying criteria require candidates to have four surveys of at least 3 percent in national or early-state polls or to get at least 5 percent support in two polls from the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina (under this scenario, polls from the same pollster in the same state count). Candidates also need contributions from 165,000 unique donors (including at least 600 individual donors in at least 20 states).1

*For candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight.
To qualify for the fifth debate, a candidate must reach 3 percent in at least four national or early-state polls or 5 percent in at least two early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations. Candidates must also have at least 165,000 unique donors, including at least 600 donors in at least 20 states or territories. We rely on self-reported figures from the campaigns for candidates’ fundraising numbers, and we’ve assumed that candidates who have reported having at least 165,000 donors also have at least 600 donors in 20 states.

As for the remaining 11 candidates that FiveThirtyEight considers “major” who haven’t yet qualified, only five have met the donor threshold. And of those five, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang is the closest to qualifying — he needs just one more poll to make it. Meanwhile, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke each need three more qualifying surveys, which leaves them with quite a bit of work to do. Neither former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro nor Rep. Tulsi Gabbard have a single qualifying poll to speak of, so they might be in serious danger of missing the debate.
The other six candidates are all in even more trouble and, as I wrote last week, belong in a tier of candidates who have little to no chance of qualifying, as they haven’t met the donor requirement or earned one qualifying poll. Of course, the date for the November debate hasn’t yet been announced, so the qualification deadline remains up in the air. That could help out some candidates on the edge. But at this point, it’s still hard to imagine that more than 10 candidates will make the stage.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

18 construction workers
At least 18 construction workers in California, Colorado, Texas and Washington who frequently cut slabs of an “engineered stone” used in countertops have recently suffered severe lung damage, according to doctors and public health officials. The composite artificial stone material can be comprised of more than 90 percent silica, a mineral that is dangerous to breathe in while in dust form, but increasingly popular in American bathrooms and kitchens. Congressional lawmakers are asking the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration to create a new program that would better protect workers and ensure levels of silica dust are within allowable limits.

11 suspicious deaths
Melanie Proctor thought her dad Felix McDermott had died of natural causes. In August 2018, though, four months after he was buried, a visit from the FBI revealed suspicions that her father had not passed away from severe hypoglycemia after all, but rather from a deadly injection of insulin. The case is now part of a 14-month investigation involving 11 suspicious deaths at the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center, and larger questions about the overall quality of care from the Department of Veteran Affairs. [Washington Post]
$40 million for inflated numbers
It turns out that Facebook isn’t just unreliable in telling you how many of your friends are getting married and having babies or how many people went to Iceland on vacation, it was also apparently juicing its video metrics to advertisers. Facebook actually admitted to the faulty numbers in 2016, but the social media company has now agreed to pay a $40 million settlement as part of a class-action lawsuit brought by advertisers. Allegations during the lawsuit included claims that the social network knew about its inaccurate information earlier than it had informed advertisers, and that it had inflated video metrics by up to 900 percent.

60 people rescued
On Monday morning, a collision occurred off the coast of the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture, in Japan’s exclusive economic zone, between a North Korean fishing boat and a patrol boat from the Japanese Fisheries Agency. Sixty people were reportedly thrown overboard, but media reports say that everyone was rescued without injuries. The location of the collision was in an area known as Yamototai, where illegal fishing by North Korean fishers has risen despite more than 5,000 warnings issued each year and confiscation of goods.

Biles II
Simone Biles, arguably one of the greatest American athletes of all time, completed two new moves that will now bear her name while competing at the world championships in Stuttgart, Germany. On Saturday, Biles landed a triple double as part of her floor exercise routine, which involves a double backflip with three twists and is now known as “The Biles II.” Her double-double dismount on the balance beam, a double backflip with two twists, will also be known as “The Biles.” [CNN]
5.3 years
A new study on the brains of former tackle football players with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.), the degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head, found that the risk of developing the worst forms of the disease doubled for every 5.3 years of playing experience. The study was based on the retrospective analysis of 266 brain specimens of former amateur and professional players that had been donated to researchers at Boston University, and the results were published in the medical journal Annals of Neurology. It was the first study that “calculated the number of years played with levels of measurable disease in the brain.” [New York Times]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-impeachment-more-popular-because-of-ukraine-or-because-voters-are-sheep/,2019-10-04,,,features,"Oct. 4, 2019",Is Impeachment More Popular Because Of Ukraine? Or Because Voters Are Sheep?,Perry Bacon Jr.,FiveThirtyEight,Impeachment,"Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.
Poll(s) of the week
Public support for impeaching President Trump has gone up significantly over the last two weeks. And a big part of that increase comes from Democrats; about 79 percent support impeachment as of Thursday evening, according to the FiveThirtyEight average, up from about 72 percent before the Ukraine scandal broke.1
That raises an interesting question: Did Americans, particularly Democrats, decide on their own that Trump pushing the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter crossed into impeachable behavior? Or is the public following the views of elites, with a sizable bloc of Democrats embracing impeachment only after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and almost the entire party got on board?
The two events — news of the president’s phone call with Ukraine and congressional Democrats deciding to start the impeachment process — happened in quick succession, so we may never be able to untangle the exact causal threads. But the safest assumption doesn’t really require much untangling: It likely took both factors to move public opinion so suddenly.
What evidence do we have that the Ukraine news itself shifted opinion? Well, we’ve seen just as big a jump in support for impeachment among independents as Democrats — and presumably independents don’t care as much about the views of either party’s leaders.2
Polls also show that Americans say they are concerned about the Ukraine scandal. A Quinnipiac poll found 50 percent of voters said Trump had “done something wrong” in his interactions with the Ukrainian president. And an ABC News/Ipsos survey found that a clear majority of respondents said that it was a “very serious” (43 percent) or “somewhat serious” (21 percent) problem that Trump “encouraged the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.”
Then again, these measures — support for impeachment among independents and Americans’ views of Trump’s actions — are themselves likely influenced by elites, particularly the media. (I think the media is more clearly covering the Ukraine controversy as “Trump did a bad thing” than it did the Russia investigation.)
Moreover, there’s a fair amount of political science research suggesting that voters are more tied to their parties than to their issue positions. For example, when Democratic Party leaders decided to support same-sex marriage, many Democratic voters who opposed gay marriage simply changed their position, rather than leave the party. The rise of Trump displayed the same dynamic, as many Republican voters who used to be wary of Russia and care deeply about the moral values of politicians abandoned those views to align with their party’s leader. So the increase in Democratic support for impeachment after Pelosi and more moderate Democrats got on board fits that broader pattern.
Why does it matter what exactly caused this shift in public opinion? Well, if people change their minds about something largely because of new facts, that’s fairly intuitive and not particularly surprising. Perhaps impeachment became more popular largely because Trump did something that was clearly bad and, unlike special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, fairly easy to understand.
But if impeachment got more popular largely because Democratic voters, and some independents, are taking cues from party leaders, that’s more interesting. If voters are basically lemmings following the dictates of their party’s leaders, fairly unpopular ideas can in theory become more popular — and perhaps popular ideas can become less popular.
Pelosi often says that she is weighing public opinion as she makes her decisions. But what if politicians, particularly someone in a high-profile role like Pelosi, are shaping public opinion as they react to it? For example, Biden, Pelosi and centrist Democrats in Congress are wary of a Medicare for All health care system (as opposed to keeping the existing system, but letting some people enroll in a Medicare-style health care option if they choose). And polls suggest Medicare for All is not particularly popular with voters, even among Democrats. But if key leaders in the Democratic Party got behind Medicare for All — or even a more unpopular idea, like reparations — would most Democratic-leaning voters start supporting it, thus significantly raising its overall popularity in a country that is divided fairly evenly between the two parties?
Conversely, if Biden becomes the Democratic nominee, does single-payer health care become even more unpopular among Democrats, since he will be the party’s standard-bearer and has made his opposition to the policy clear?
I’m sure there are limits to how much party leaders can move the voters in their parties. But it’s worth thinking about this dynamic as you read poll results and watch how politicians react to them.
Other polling bites 
47 percent of Americans think race relations in the country are worse than they were a year ago, according to a new AP-NORC poll. The poll found 33 percent of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling “race relations,” compared to 65 percent who disapprove. This result breaks along racial lines: 43 percent of white Americans approve of Trump’s actions on race relations, compared to 16 percent of Hispanics and 5 percent of blacks.
32 percent of likely voters in California say they would back an upcoming referendum to overturn a recently passed law in the Golden State that eliminates cash bail, according to a new Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll; 39 percent want the law to stay in place, and 29 percent are undecided.
77 percent of adults in the United Kingdom and 75 percent in Canada support a universal basic income program meant to help people who lose jobs because of technological advancements, according to a recent poll conducted by Gallup and Northeastern University. Support for such a UBI program was much lower in the United States, at 43 percent.
According to a new Pew Research Center poll, 62 percent of Americans think that social media companies have too much control over the mix of news that people see. That includes majorities of respondents who identify as Republican or Republican-leaning (75 percent) as well as Democratic or Democratic-leaning (53 percent).
Federal agencies like NASA (81 percent favorable), the National Park Service (86 percent) and the U.S. Postal Service (90 percent) are almost universally popular among Americans, according to a new Pew poll. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (52 percent unfavorable) and the Department of Education (48 percent unfavorable) are the least popular agencies.
Fewer than 1-in-4 Americans (23 percent) think the economy will improve over the next year, according to CNBC’s latest All-America Economic Survey. That’s a three-year low.
A Seton Hall Sports poll found that Americans support student-athletes making money by almost a 2-to-1 margin. Sixty percent favored allowing them to “profit from the use of their name, likeness or image” while 32 percent were opposed.
Only 34 percent of Americans approve of Trump “as a person,” according to a new Gallup poll. The same survey found the president’s job approval at 40 percent.
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 41.2 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.9 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -12.7 points). At this time last week, 42.8 percent approved and 53.2 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -10.4 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 41.5 percent and a disapproval rating of 54.0 percent, for a net approval rating of -12.5 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.9 percentage points (46.9 percent to 40.0 percent). At this time last week, Democrats led by 6. 8 percentage points (46.8 percent to 40.0 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.3 points (46.4 percent to 39.7 percent).

$12.2 million
A 13-foot satirical oil painting by Banksy — which shows the UK’s House of Commons filled with chimpanzees and is titled “Devolved Parliament” — sold for $12.2 million (£9,879,500), almost five times more than its top estimated price. The record-breaking artwork was created in 2009 for an exhibit at the Bristol Museum and re-exhibited at the same institution on March 28 of this year, the day before the original Brexit Day. The previous highest price for a Banksy artwork at auction was $1,870,000, paid for a painting called “Keep it Spotless” in 2008. [CNN]
5.7 percent
Data analysis from ESPN’s Stats & Information Group shows college football teams are punting less often inside the midfield, both on a per-game basis and as a percentage of all drives. Josh Planos and Neil Paine report that “just 5.7 percent of all Power Five offensive drives this season have resulted in a punt in opponent territory, the lowest rate since at least 2008.” Analysis of Power Five teams’ first five games of the college football season going back to 2008 shows more drives are ending in touchdowns today, rather than punts. [FiveThirtyEight]
24 states
Two dozen states are challenging Purdue Pharma’s request to pay its executives $38 million in bonuses, incentives and severance payments after the company filed for bankruptcy protection. The private pharmaceutical company has been accused of triggering the opioid crisis through “aggressive and deceptive marketing,” resulting in billions in profits. The company’s bankruptcy filing is part of an effort to deal with the more than 2,600 lawsuits it’s facing. [Bloomberg]
Category 6 hurricane
Meteorologist Jeff Masters says the conditions of Hurricane Dorian, with its sustained winds of 185 mph and gusts up to 220 mph, would qualify it for a Category 6 rating, which does not currently exist on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind scale. Category 5 is defined by “sustained 1-minute average wind speeds of at least 157 mph (70 m/s).” The new level of intensity would help define the extreme rarity of a hurricane like Dorian, which heavily damaged much of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas in September. [Scientific American]
2,700 schools
Data analysis of measles-mumps-rubella vaccination records at thousands of American schools show many educational institutions do not have the immunization levels considered adequate to protect a population from measles. The Wall Street Journal found many schools have rates in the 70 percent to 80 percent range — about 2,700 schools in all fell below the 80 percent level — and some small, private schools have rates around 50 percent. This is significantly lower than the guidelines from the World Health Organization, which say “95 percent of a population needs to be vaccinated to prevent the disease from spreading.” [The Wall Street Journal]
400,000 tons of Himalayan salt
You’ve seen Himalayan pink salt sold in spa treatments, at Trader Joe’s and even as lamps. But industry advocates in Pakistan want you to know most of it doesn’t originate in India. A region of Pakistan that’s home to huge mines of pink salt winds up exporting around 400,000 tons of salt each year, and a big chunk of it goes to India for processing. From there, it’s sold on to consumers, including those in Europe and the United States, at a markup. [National Public Radio]

That Doesn’t Mean It’s Going To Stay Good.,Josh Hermsmeyer,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"After four full weeks of play, the New England Patriots are one of only three undefeated teams left in the NFL,1 and their defense is getting much of the credit for their early success. The Patriots lead the league in point differential at +95 and, on the strength of defensive backs Jonathan Jones and Jason McCourty, have been particularly good against the pass. New England has yet to allow a passing touchdown this year, making it one of just 10 teams since the AFL-NFL merger to accomplish that feat in the first four games of the season. And it’s not just the pass defense. The Patriots have surrendered just one touchdown in total on defense — a 1-yard run by Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen in Week 4.
Given these eye-popping stats, we would expect the Patriots to top the leaderboard in defensive expected points added per play. And that’s exactly what we find. New England stands atop the rankings with an EPA per play more than double that of the second-ranked defense, San Francisco’s.2

This list tracks well with our intuition of how defenses have performed and passes the “eye test.” New England, San Francisco, Chicago and Buffalo appear to be good defenses, and Miami, Oakland, Baltimore and Indianapolis appear to be bad. With a quarter of the season finished, we might even be tempted to draw some conclusions from this defensive leaderboard — it seems reasonable to expect the good defenses to stay good and the bad to remain bad. But does further evidence actually support making these inferences? Or are our eyes and the aforementioned data fooling us?
To find out, we took ESPN Stats & Information Group data from 2006 through 2018 and calculated the year-to-date EPA per play for each team prior to a given game. Then, we tested how well the team’s past performance predicted what the teams ultimately did in those games.
As an example, for a team’s fifth game of the season, we looked at the previous four weeks of games and calculated the EPA per play for each team.3 We then took those EPA averages and tested how well they predicted the EPA per play for that team in Game 5. If a defense was good in the first through fourth games, did it tend to stay good in the fifth? We conducted this analysis for each game of the season for both offense and defense, using the data from all previous games of the season. The results were surprising.

There’s a lot we don’t know about teams early in the season, but after nine or 10 games, we like to think that we have a decent idea about how each unit will perform in a given game, especially late in the season with the playoff picture in focus. This turns out to be partially true — for the offense, anyway. Our ability to predict a team’s offensive performance in an upcoming game does improve as the year goes on, peaking around Game 11. But, surprisingly, this isn’t true for the defense. We know roughly as much about a team’s upcoming defensive performance after one game of results as we do after 12 or 13.
In fairness, our ability to predict offensive performance is fairly modest,4 and by the very end of the season, we do see a small spike in our ability to predict defensive performance. But when comparing the predictive power of the two measures, the difference ranges from moderate to dramatic. Exactly why we can’t predict defense as well is hard to say with any confidence, but it might start with our inability to fully quantify the parts of a defender’s performance that are stable over time and reliably impact a game. In other words, it’s possible that we aren’t measuring the right thing by taking the aggregate performance of the offenses a team has faced and assigning the relative success or failure to the defense. Rather than capturing the strength of a team’s defensive unit, our metrics and stats may mostly be measuring a team’s strength of schedule.
Taking this view, the Patriots’ defensive performance is perhaps best attributed to the inept offensive performances of their opponents: the Steelers with an aging Ben Roethlisberger and newly without Antonio Brown; the tanking Miami Dolphins in a 43-0 blowout; a Jets team led by quarterback Luke Falk because of Sam Darnold’s bout with mononucleosis; and a narrow win over the Bills without a concussed Allen in the fourth quarter of Week 4.
Perhaps these performances aren’t as clear a harbinger of future defensive success as Patriots fans would like to believe. Conversely, it’s potentially good news for the defenses of Indianapolis, Baltimore and Oakland.5 We should probably be hesitant to read too much into their slow starts. Things can change quickly in the NFL, especially on defense.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-has-the-ukraine-scandal-affected-trumps-approval-rating/,2019-10-04,,,features,"Oct. 4, 2019",How Has The Ukraine Scandal Affected Trump’s Approval Rating?,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,Presidential Approval,"Shortly after news broke that President Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a political rival, support for his impeachment increased sharply, according to our impeachment polling tracker. But the ramifications of the Ukraine scandal (and the resulting impeachment inquiry) for Trump’s reelection prospects are murkier.
If the effect of the Ukraine scandal is that people who already disliked Trump simply dislike him more, Trump’s reelection chances may not be hurt that much. As you can see in recent polls, much of the increased support for impeachment so far has come from Democrats, few of whom were probably planning to vote for Trump anyway.
So one other data point to keep an eye on is Trump’s approval rating — if the scandal is turning any supporters into opponents (or at least skeptics), it will show up there. It’s still early, so public opinion is still subject to a lot of change, but now that the scandal has had almost two weeks to unfold, we may be starting to see just that:
Then again, that movement could simply be noise or reversion to the mean.
As of Sept. 24 — the day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally announced an impeachment inquiry — Trump’s approval rating sat at an unusually high 43.1 percent. But today, his approval rating sits at 41.3 percent.1 That’s a nearly 2-point drop in a little over a week, suggesting that the Ukraine scandal may be giving Trump supporters second thoughts about the president. Two points isn’t a ton of movement, but as my colleague Geoffrey Skelley has written, Trump’s approval rating is incredibly stable, so even a shift of 1 or 2 points can be notable.
On the other hand, this also just brings Trump’s approval rating back to about where it was earlier in September. In fact, Trump’s 43.1 percent approval rating on Sept. 24 was his highest mark all year,2 and it’s possible that the uptick that got Trump there was just noise. If you look only at high-quality polls3 of Trump’s approval rating before and after news of the Ukraine scandal broke,4 there’s actually been little change in Trump’s popularity (if anything, it has ticked slightly up).
Trump’s approval rating hasn’t changed in high-quality polls

Another possibility is that the Ukraine scandal reversed a mini polling comeback that Trump was enjoying in mid-September, and these high-quality polls missed it simply due to timing. The bottom line is, a lot of things could be happening here, and we should wait for more data.
In summary, here in the early days of the Ukraine/impeachment drama, Trump’s popularity has stayed within the narrow range it has inhabited since February (41.0-43.1 percent for his approval rating, 52.3-54.3 percent for his disapproval rating). In other words, the Ukraine scandal still hasn’t eaten into Trump’s true base of support.
But that doesn’t mean that his low approval rating won’t be a problem for him in 2020. There is a nontrivial difference between a 43 percent approval rating and a 41 percent approval rating, and at 41 percent or lower (if it continues to trend downward), it’ll be that much harder for him to win 46 percent of the popular vote like he did in 2016 (let alone improve on that performance). It’s too early to draw any conclusions for sure, but how Trump’s approval ratings change in the coming weeks will be among the most important consequences of this story.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, Poniewozik discusses how the evolution of television from three networks to today’s more scattered landscape helps explain our current politics. It’s the case he makes in his book, “Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America.”

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-republicans-ever-turn-on-trump-itll-happen-all-at-once/,2019-10-03,,,features,"Oct. 3, 2019","If Republicans Ever Turn On Trump, It’ll Happen All At Once",Lee Drutman,FiveThirtyEight,Congress,"In the House, Democrats are inching ever closer to impeaching President Trump. Some are even pushing for drafting articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving and, potentially, sending proceedings to the Senate by early next year. If the charges reach the upper chamber, at least 20 Republicans would have to join every Democrat in voting guilty in order to reach the two-thirds supermajority needed to remove the president from office.

So now begins the reading of the tea leaves and the careful scrutiny of every Republican senator’s statements (or silence). Will Republicans finally break with Trump? We may not know until it happens. But be forewarned — if it does happen, it will likely take us by surprise. After all, political science has shown us that big political changes often come suddenly, after long periods of stasis. Looking back, it seems like of course the Soviet Union was bound to collapse. But up until the moment it did — and remember, it fell all at once — almost nobody predicted it.
Why Republicans are unlikely to turn on Trump
It’s not exactly a secret that if congressional Republicans could hold a secret-ballot no-confidence vote,1 they’d probably vote to oust Trump. There’s just one problem with that logic (aside from the fact that it’s not how our democracy works): Private preferences aside, congressional Republicans actually have some very strong incentives to support Trump publicly, at both the individual and collective level.
Take those who have openly challenged the president. The few, like former South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford or Alabama Rep. Martha Roby, have faced primary challengers as a result — Sanford lost his renomination bid, and Roby was forced into a runoff. Others, like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake simply retired, fearing tough reelection prospects. And this all adds up, contributing to the perception that Trump’s popularity is un-dentable among GOP voters. Republicans likely won’t individually take on Trump, unless, of course, his approval rating tanks and he becomes a liability to the party. But that’s only likely to happen if his fellow Republicans all turn against him. And therein lies the rub.
Collectively, Republicans want to keep Trump popular so they can keep winning elections. In our era of increasingly nationalized politics, most Republicans can’t run independently of the president, even if they want to. Perhaps recognizing this, many have instead tied themselves more closely to him. Trump defines the Republican Party brand as president, so if Trump is unpopular, the Republican Party is unpopular, which would likely spell steep electoral losses for the party.
The only way this dynamic changes is if the entire Republican Party apparatus (not just politicians, but also media commentators and surrogates) turns on Trump en masse. But for this to happen, somebody still has to speak up first, and others have to follow. But it could happen. Let’s use political scientist Timur Kuran’s classic work, “Private Truth, Public Lies: The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification,” as a guide to understanding major political transformations. He argues that political regimes can persist despite being unpopular, which is why a government overthrow, when it does come, can often seem so sudden.
Consider the Arab Spring, which began with one Tunisian vendor, who protested being mistreated by government officials by setting himself on fire. His death triggered a series of events, and a month later, the long-unpopular authoritarian Tunisian president fled the country after more than 23 years in power. A few weeks later, protesters in Egypt ousted their own long-serving authoritarian leader. What looked like ironclad power collapsed in a matter of weeks. Why?
Kuran argues in his book that protests need a critical mass of supporters in order to force change. The logic is that there’s safety in numbers, so if multiple citizens rise up in protest of a regime, it signals that it’s OK to protest — which can cause decades-old regimes to collapse all at once.
Signs the GOP might soon abandon Trump
How does this all factor into the politics of impeachment, exactly? Well, the basic logic is the same — right now, Republicans in Congress aren’t willing to stand up to Trump, so there’s no sign that someone’s willing to be the first to go. Without a bold leader, there are no bold followers. But without the promise of bold followers, there are no bold leaders.
Who goes first matters, too, because if we’re talking about a monumental sea change, it isn’t moderate Republicans like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine or Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah who will lead the GOP parade.
Rather, it’s rank-and-file Republican senators up for reelection in solidly red states, like Bill Cassidy from Louisiana or Jim Inhofe from Oklahoma, whom you should watch. If they waver, that will signal that Trump’s days are numbered. Of course, the rub is that neither have spoken out against Trump — in fact, they’ve stuck by him — but that’s the point. If Republicans do abandon Trump over impeachment, it will be because of the senators least likely to strike out against Trump balked.
Each new development potentially changes the calculus, too. For instance, last Tuesday, the Senate unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution calling on the Trump administration to release the whistleblower complaint that alleged the president had tried to coerce the Ukranian president to investigate Democratic front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden. The resolution signaled a surprising bipartisan willingness to let more information out. But by Thursday, after the whistleblower’s complaint went public, most Republicans had already rallied around talking points that questioned the motivations and veracity of the whistleblower, instead of criticizing Trump. The short-lived moment for a cascade passed almost as quickly as it had come.
But if you’re looking for another moment when Republicans might break with Trump, look for an event like last Tuesday. Moments like that can create uncertainty and situations where the ground can shift quickly. For most congressional Republicans, this is no doubt a frustrating state of affairs. Few presumably relish defending Trump against the increasingly indefensible. But this is where the party is currently stuck.
Even if most Republicans believe Trump is bad for the long-term health of the party, they have a major here-to-there problem. Turning against Trump seriously jeopardizes their immediate political fortunes. So all signs point to Republicans sticking it out with Trump. That means they’ll continue to find new ways to dance and dodge, and eventually, they’ll probably even vote to exonerate him in a Senate impeachment trial, if things come to that. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in particular, has no incentive to break from Trump. After all, his plan for grinding out partisan victories with Trump in the White House involves the same zero-sum attack politics as the president uses. Not to mention, McConnell is also among those red-state Republicans up for election in 2020.
If there is a Republican cascade against Trump, in retrospect, it will look inevitable, as if the steady drip of revelations and testimony was always destined to reach that final dramatic tipping point. But a note to future historians: As of this moment, it does not look inevitable at all.

$7.5 billion
The price of goods from the European Union is set to go up after the World Trade Organization approved a U.S. request to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion in imports, citing subsidies to the aircraft company Airbus by the governments of several European countries. In a summary of its findings, the WTO said the U.S. first lodged complaints in 2004 and the E.U. had failed “to take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects or … withdraw the subsidy,” resulting in the U.S. suffering a significant loss of sales. The European Commissioner for Trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, said any new tariffs levied by the U.S. would be “short-sighted and counterproductive” and could lead to counter-tariffs. [CNBC]
600,000 pardons
The Mainichi Shimbun, a major Japanese daily newspaper, reports that approximately 600,000 petty criminals will be pardoned to mark Emperor Naruhito’s enthronement ceremony on Oct. 22, according to unidentified government sources. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga would not confirm or deny a government plan for amnesty, telling reporters, “We are currently considering the matter carefully. I refrain from commenting on details.” An enthronement ceremony held for former emperor Akihito in 1990 resulted in pardons for 2.5 million people. [Reuters/Straits Times]
500,000 YouTube subscribers
Some people rely on earplugs or melatonin to get to sleep, but 500,000 YouTube subscribers watch videos of 17-year-old Owen Dennis Riley pretending to be a great boyfriend. He is part of a growing number of content creators producing a niche kind of video that combines techniques that trigger autonomous sensory meridian responses (often called ASMR for short) and boyfriend role play. Riley’s most popular video garnered 2 million views, earning him about $6,000. [The New York Times]
14th-least-predictable week
Many of the results from Week 4 of the NFL season ⁠— the Tampa Bay Buccaneers running up a huge score against the defending NFC champion LA Rams; road upsets from the Panthers, Raiders, Browns and Titans; even a surprise performance from the Lions against the Chiefs ⁠— weren’t just a surprise, they also really didn’t match pregame probabilities. FiveThirtyEight’s Elo model of pregame forecasts (based on power ratings and things like major injuries) was so different from the actual results that Week 4 was rated the 14th-least-unpredictable week of any NFL season since 1970. Senior sportswriter Neil Paine says, “Week 4 proved once again that we never know as much about the NFL as we think we do.” [FiveThirtyEight]
360 million years old
Fossilized shark teeth are pretty common, but because of how rarely skeletons and other parts of the animals are preserved, scientists don’t know what early sharks looked like. In the eastern Anti-Atlas Mountains of Morocco, paleontologists were astonished to find several skulls and an almost complete skeleton from a primitive shark genus called Phoebodus, expanding scientific knowledge of the animal far beyond its mouth. The discovered fossils, which were about 360 to 370 million years old, revealed an eel-like body with a long snout, similar to the modern frilled shark. [National Geographic]
98 degrees
The name of Nick Lachey’s former boy band was unfortunately also a description of the weather in the District of Columbia on Wednesday, where the temperature hit a record 98 degrees Fahrenheit (36 degrees Celsius). Much of the eastern United States experienced an unusual heat wave the second day of October, with D.C. breaking its previous all-time monthly temperature record of 96 degrees, set on Oct. 5, 1941. The cities of Baltimore; New York; Atlantic City, New Jersey; and Wilmington, Delaware, also set new temperature records in the low to mid 90s. [The Washington Post]

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Stories around the allegations that President Trump used the power of the presidency to seek dirt on his political rival in a phone call to the Ukrainian president in July are moving fast. The House has opened an official impeachment inquiry into the president, and some Democrats have even suggested they’ll draft articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving.
But there’s also an election going on (in case you forgot) … so how does the question of whether Congress should move to impeach Trump affect the Democratic primary?
nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): Well, since Sept. 20 — which is both the day the Wall Street Journal broke the news that the whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and, not coincidentally, the last time I really thought about the 2020 Democratic primary — Sen. Elizabeth Warren has gained significantly in the Real Clear Politics average, and Biden has slipped.
And I think there are lots of reasons to believe this story would help Warren and hurt Biden.
Warren was one of the first 2020 candidates to come out in favor of impeachment, back in April, and she has been one of the clearest candidates about where she stands on the issue.
So given that support for impeachment has increased among Democrats, as our tracker of impeachment polls shows, I think a sense of urgency among Democrats to impeach Trump could help Warren.
perry (Perry Bacon Jr., senior writer): I disagree with this take pretty strongly.
nrakich: Oh good! I was afraid we were all going to agree.
perry: I don’t think the “scandal” (Biden himself did nothing wrong; his son, Hunter Biden, seems to have done something that is perhaps not ideal but not illegal) will hurt Biden among Democratic voters who were already seriously considering voting for him.
Basically everyone in the party is defending him, and I suspect that the people who are likely to say this is a problem for him (by showing he and his family made money through politics/cronyism) were already Warren or Bernie Sanders supporters.
Impeachment is the position of the Democratic Party, and Biden is in line with that. He and Warren are not that different on this issue now.
nrakich: But doesn’t it show leadership on Warren’s part that she was one of the first to call for impeachment?
As for Biden himself, I don’t think a lot of Democrats buy what Trump is selling — that Biden’s activities in Ukraine were corrupt. But I think it could pierce his aura of electability if Democrats worry that it’s something that could be used against him in a general election.
sarahf: Yeah, I tend to agree with Perry, but do think there is a “tug-of-war” around media narratives right now involving the Ukraine scandal, and while Fox News has been the main outlet focusing more on Biden’s involvement in Ukraine, rather than Trump’s conduct, the déjà vu to 2016 makes me think this has the potential to overtake/overshadow the primary.

natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): I think impeachment is pretty clearly good news for Warren. But that’s not mutually exclusive with it being good news for Biden. My initial instinct was that it could help Biden in some ways because (1) Democrats would have to come to his defense, and (2) it makes Trump looks like he fears Biden, which bolsters his electability case. My second instinct, though, is that it isn’t so helpful for Biden.
Why? It’s not so much because his vague aura of electability might suffer, although maybe there’s some of that. But more because it requires a campaign that can be nimble and react to unpredictable news developments in real time, and I’m not really sure that campaign is Biden’s — they’ve run a very risk-averse strategy so far.
perry: But I think Biden is smart to lean into this and basically argue, “I’m so electable that Trump is already trying to cheat to beat me.” That seems like a good argument to me, particularly in the Democratic primary. That argument also seems true!
natesilver: It’s a pretty decent argument!
Another dimension to all this is that if impeachment is in the news all the time, it’s bad news for any candidate who isn’t one of the front-runners now. Since the story occupies a lot of media bandwidth that could be spent on, I dunno, a Cory Booker surge, or whatever.
perry: But in general, I do think a fast-moving event favors Warren, just because her strategy (run to the left) is easy to execute and Biden’s (figure out where the middle of the electorate is) is a bit harder. And if this moves to the Senate, you can imagine Warren being like, “Let’s convict” and Biden being less eager to say that.
nrakich: Maybe this is a bad analogy, but I think maybe the impeachment issue is to Warren as the Iraq War was to Barack Obama in 2008. He had a clear anti-war stance and no past baggage on the issue (unlike Hillary Clinton, who had voted for the war), and that really gave him credibility on an important issue to Democratic primary voters.
Furthermore, Warren’s steady rise in the polls actually started around the time she came out in favor of impeachment in April — although there were also a lot of other factors at play, so we can’t say for sure it was the reason she caught fire.
sarahf: I mean, to some extent, though, this has to be objectively better for anyone who isn’t Biden, because being dragged through the mud on this scandal (regardless of whether any wrongdoing actually happened) isn’t great PR.
And while the Biden campaign has tried to put the kibosh on stories that Biden did anything wrong, I do find it astounding that a Monmouth poll this week found that 42 percent of voters think Biden “probably did” pressure Ukrainian officials to not investigate his son’s business interests.
perry: I still think the number of Biden Democratic primary supporters leaving him over this is close to zero, and the number of Democrats who were thinking about voting for Biden who will be bothered by this is also close to zero.
What percentage of that 42 percent will vote for Trump? Probably most of them.
nrakich: Yeah, and that’s borne out by the crosstabs of that poll — Democrats said 65 percent to 19 percent that Biden “probably did not” inappropriately pressure Ukraine. But as I said above, it’s not about Democrats leaving Biden because they believe the allegations. It’s about them getting scared that he now has a scandal, however unsubstantiated, that could hurt him in the general election.
perry: So they choose Warren instead?
Does that seem likely to you?
natesilver: Yeah I’m with Perry on this!
I think voters aren’t taking “electability” quite as literally as you or I might.
Otherwise they’d consider Amy Klobuchar really electable or whatever, because she’s from a swing-ish state and has won by big margins before.
nrakich: Nate, I agree that the ordinary voter may not spend a lot of time diving into a candidate’s average overperformance above partisan lean or whatever — but I think simpler concepts like “scandals hurt your chances of winning” can resonate. This may be one of the lessons many people took from 2016 (along with, maybe, “America isn’t ready to elect a woman president”) — that even an overhyped scandal like the one over Clinton’s emails can cost someone an election.
And Perry, Warren doesn’t need all those ex-Biden voters to flock to her. She is doing fine on her own. If Biden drops to 15 percent, Warren will probably be in first place by default.
sarahf: I’m not sure we’ll see mass defection from Biden over this. But I do think Warren stands to benefit, however marginally, just by not being at the center of it all. I still think that while the Ukraine situation might not be bad for Biden, it’s not great either.
perry: Part of why I don’t think this will hurt Biden with voters who care a lot about electability is because the rest of the really viable candidates don’t scream electable (the white woman, the black woman, the socialist, the 37-year-old) in the way that voters typically think about electability.
natesilver: We also haven’t really seen how perceptions of Warren change now that she’s perceived by the media as a front-runner — maybe even the front-runner — instead of an underdog. I do wonder if there’s a bit of recency bias in how we’re covering that too.
nrakich: Right. I fully expect a scrutiny cycle for Warren coming up.
But I think that’s outside the purview of this chat! 🙂
natesilver: I mean, in some ways, you’d think that Biden could gain ground by saying, “While all these other Democrats are out there talking about impeachment, I’m talking about how we can BEAT Donald Trump based on issues that matter to the middle class,” etc.
Except that… the scandal at the heart of Democrats’ best impeachment case directly involves him!
sarahf: I do wonder, though, how much people are generally factoring impeachment into how they think about either a) the candidates or b) the election, period. Granted, this CNN poll is from March, but what stood out to me in that poll is that no one named the Russia investigation as their top issue for 2020. Do you think we’re headed toward a similar outcome here? Or is the dynamic different?
natesilver: At the very least, Democratic voters’ focus on impeachment is likely to increase now that all the party leaders and candidates back it.
perry: Where there might be a shift is in how the primary is fought. Basically every debate up to now has had this super-boring Medicare for All vs. Medicare “for everyone who wants it” discussion. But does that go away now? Are the terms of the campaign now different?
sarahf: Do you think there will now be more questions about whether the candidates support impeachment?
perry: Not impeachment. But the debates have all been very policy-focused. And now I wonder if they will be more about democratic norms and values. “Should Trump be removed from office?” is certainly a question that will be asked.
nrakich: Yeah, the irony of this whole thing is that impeachment is actually an irrelevant topic for a presidential campaign. If any of these people wins the White House, Trump will be out of office anyway!
perry: But impeachment is in the news, and I think it’s more interesting than restating everyone’s Medicare position. It could lead to more interesting questions, too. For example, Kamala Harris’s idea to ban Trump from Twitter has come out of this whole discussion. My guess is Warren may be to the right of Harris on that.
nrakich: Oh, I agree that it will come up. I just find it funny.
natesilver: But calling on Twitter to kick Trump off, though, is (apart from the journalistic case against kicking Trump off Twitter) sort of daft strategically since Trump probably hurts himself politically (and maybe even legally) with his various outbursts on Twitter. You’ve also had Harris calling for Brett Kavanaugh’s impeachment if I’m not mistaken, which seemed very off-message for Democrats.
nrakich: Warren did as well.
perry: The primary has largely been a wonk-fest, which is good for wonky candidates (Warren) and candidates who clearly reject wonkiness (Biden). But maybe this is a new phase of the campaign and a different type of candidate emerges. Maybe someone like Pete Buttigieg who has campaigned a lot on norms and democratic values. He also speaks about foreign policy fairly fluently. I wonder if he can turn this moment into something.
sarahf: Given that support for impeachment is so high among Democrats, do you think any of the candidates have anything to lose by saying they support impeaching Trump?
natesilver: I dunno. If Harris is any indication, I don’t think it’s going to be very easy for any of the other low-polling Democrats to latch onto a good argument about impeachment.
perry: Right, now that impeachment is a position of the party, I think it’s hard to differentiate yourself on it.
natesilver: I guess you could argue it’s good for Tom Steyer, who really was out in front on impeachment.
nrakich: Yeah, by all rights, Steyer should get a boost from this, as he’s run so many TV ads on the topic. But I think your point above about the media oxygen being taken away from non-front-runners is a good one.
natesilver: Maybe in a weird way it’s good, too, for someone like Andrew Yang, because he’s the most unconventional candidate and can counterprogram the most. It’s not like he’s been relying on much traditional media attention anyway.
Like, if you’re airing something alongside the Super Bowl, you don’t want to be showing a college football game. You want something really different.
nrakich: Like the Puppy Bowl???
sarahf: Tulsi Gabbard certainly held out on supporting impeachment — but to Nate’s earlier point, I’m not sure talking impeachment will help differentiate any of the candidates already struggling in the polls.
But OK, if the conversation does become more about norms and values and how we think about the office of the presidency, does that actually change the primary that much?
natesilver: I guess one way it could be bad for Warren is if it makes the debates less policy-driven. Then again, I’m not sure if Warren is benefiting from her policy positions so much as being branded as The Policy Candidate™.
nrakich: One point worth reiterating is that we’re still probably very early in the Trump/Ukraine/impeachment story timeline. The story will continue to evolve, and we don’t know where that will take the political conversation.
perry: After the El Paso shooting, Beto O’Rourke was in the news a lot. But his numbers didn’t move, and that tells me that he is still very unlikely to break through. And so while this feels like the kind of story where Buttigieg can come in and say, “This is another example of how Washington is broken and we need fresh faces,” I would not be surprised if he didn’t gain in the polls either.
A lot of what we are seeing in the polls right now is Warren gaining from Harris, Sanders and, to some extent, Biden. So I think the biggest shift for Warren, as Nate was hinting at, is not her stance on impeachment, but that she is now doing so well that her rivals will attack her more and the media will increase its scrutiny of her. Perhaps this is an atmosphere in which the primary is shaken up a bit. Warren has already kind of won the college-educated, Hillary Clinton-voter mini primary over Harris and in some ways has won the populist mini primary over Sanders, too. But what happens next is unclear.

Two weeks ago, the fifth-year Wisconsin coach notched one of the biggest wins of his career when his team trampled the Michigan Wolverines. In that game, the notoriously conservative Badgers attempted three fourth-down conversions, successfully converting all of them. That might not sound terribly surprising in a vacuum, but Wisconsin has gone for it on fourth down just 43 times since 2015, the second-fewest of any Power Five team, according to ESPN Stats & Information Group. By Badger standards, the Michigan game was downright aggressive.
But the following week against Northwestern, Chryst reverted to his old ways: decision-making as field-position optimization. When drives stalled inside Wildcat territory, out came the Badger punting unit — four separate times. Unless a team is facing a fourth-and-forever situation, the calculus suggests going for it in opponent territory, regardless of yardline, essentially every time. No college football team has punted more in plus territory in a game this season.2 You could almost hear the groans from Madison on the telecast.

Asked why he abandoned an aggressive fourth-down strategy, Chryst didn’t provide much insight, saying, “I think a couple things go into it: What are you doing offensively? How is our defense playing? Different situations.” The Badgers do indeed feature arguably the nation’s most formidable defense, but it’s also true that since Chryst was named Wisconsin head coach in 2015, his team has elected to punt 77 times in opponent territory — second-most of any team in the country.
Chryst certainly isn’t the only coach to insist on waving the white flag after his offense advances into an opponent’s side of midfield.3 But the analytical community — and those who care about their teams’ chances of success — can rest easy knowing that the rate at which coaches dial up a punt in opponent territory is falling noticeably. Through Game 5, just 5.7 percent of all Power Five offensive drives this season have resulted in a punt in opponent territory, the lowest rate since at least 2008.
This is true, no matter the offense’s field position. At any point inside the 50-yard line, the number of punts in the 2019 season falls beneath the prior 10-year average.
A team with a lead is more likely to punt, so it should come as no surprise that 56.6 percent of all punts taken at midfield or closer by Power Five teams this season have been taken by the team with more points on the board.
But even those attempts to pin an opponent deep aren’t consistently effective — it’s difficult to control an oblong ball in a narrow window. Less than 40 percent of all punts this season taken inside the 50-yard line by Power Five teams have resulted in the opponent getting pinned inside the 10-yard line. Punts taken 40 to 49 yards from goal result in a touchback nearly one-quarter of the time.
By and large, punting at the college level is dying on the vine, despite what punt acolytes like Stanford’s David Shaw and Iowa’s Kirk Ferentz would have you believe. On average, Power Five games now feature nearly as many punts per drive (0.34) as they do offensive touchdowns (0.32), with punts falling to the lowest rate since at least 2008 while offensive touchdowns reach its highest.4
Not uncoincidentally, this is happening in conjunction with a spike in fourth-down conversion attempts, which have taken place on more than 12 percent of all drives at the Power Five level this season — also the highest rate since at least 2008.
For all of the machismo that football inherently brings to the table, it doesn’t take much to be considered an aggressive play-caller. Carolina Panthers coach Ron Rivera is nicknamed “Riverboat Ron” for his propensity to attempt to convert fourth-and-1s. Kansas coach Les Miles is dubbed the “Mad Hatter” because he wears a baseball cap and delights in calling fake field goals. There’s a chance your favorite coach is one play call away from some goofy nickname meant to intimate a take-no-prisoners ethos.
The sometimes infuriatingly conservative nature of college coaches is likely related to job preservation concerns in a pressure-cooker industry. It’s harder for a coach to justify a failed fourth-down conversion than it is to put it on the defense to make a stop or ask a punter — you had one job! — to pin an opponent inside the 10-yard line.5 But the statistical evidence is overwhelming: An aggressive fourth-down strategy maximizes a team’s chances of success.
Maybe even Paul Chryst will come around.

After a week with hardly any meaningful upsets to alter the College Football Playoff landscape, there are a few better shakeup candidates this week. Take Florida versus Auburn: Both teams are currently 5-0, and the winner would receive a sizable bump to its playoff chances with a victory. In fact, either the Gators or Tigers could potentially pull within a few spots of the top four in our playoff model, depending on who wins. (The loser’s odds, meanwhile, will drop into the mid to low single digits.) The game has implications for a few other teams as well. Most notable among that group is Alabama, whose Iron Bowl task is tougher in the universes where the Tigers beat Florida.6 Despite being on the road, Auburn has a 52 percent chance of winning at the Swamp on Saturday — simply the next step in a brutal stretch of games that will also include LSU, Georgia and Alabama before the season is through.

Back in 2012, researchers from Kent State University presented survey respondents a hypothetical news story: A partisan political group has been caught swiping yard signs and defacing campaign ads. Then they asked the respondents to rate both the seriousness of crime (which, technically, it is) and how justifiable it was to break the rules. The overwhelming response: It’s not that big of a deal and it is reasonably justifiable — at least, as long as the party affiliation of the group doing the vandalism matched the affiliation of the person answering the question. If the other guys are doing it, well, by jove, Geoffrey, that is just not how things are done. Drawing squiggly moustaches upon an opponent’s face is fine for me … but not for thee.
Now a stolen yard sign is not exactly an impeachable offense. But there is a lesson here about the more serious scandal currently threatening to swamp President Trump.
It is not your imagination — partisanship really does affect the way we understand evidence of a scandal and how we interpret that evidence. You can see that in the polls that came out this week, which show sharp divides between Democrats who overwhelmingly support impeachment proceedings and Republicans who overwhelmingly oppose them. You can also see it in the comments of politicians — while Democrats see obvious malfeasance in Trump’s pressuring the Ukrainian president to look into the Bidens, Republicans have called the conversation a “nothingburger” that Democrats are hyping as an excuse to reach a foregone conclusion. And while partisanship isn’t the only thing that creates those dueling realities, experts say it’s the biggest factor. And it probably matters more now than it did in the past.
There are many different personal factors that affect how people evaluate the evidence for or against a political scandal and what they think should be done about it. Gender — both the politician’s and the voters’ — is one example, said Nick Vivyan, a politics professor at the U.K.’s Durham University. He’s found evidence that female voters have more of an interest in punishing female politicians’ who misbehave, compared to how those same voters treat men. Male voters are also more likely to treat male politicians more leniently than they treat female ones. (This is just one of many structural reinforcements that makes the glass ceiling of politics so hard for American women to crack through.)
External social and political context also affect whether a scandal sticks and what impact it has. When Brendan Nyhan, professor of government at Dartmouth, studied Washington Post coverage of presidential scandals between 1977 and 2008, he found that controversies became news faster and were covered more extensively when presidents had lower approval ratings among opposition voters and when there was simply less happening in the news to distract the reporters.
But while those things matter, Vivyan told me, it’s partisanship that is “the most obvious and often the most salient” factor at play. “Partisanship is the biggest predictor we have,” he said, of whether someone who looks at a set of facts will see an im🍑ment waiting to happen or just so much rotten fruit.

And that effect has grown over time in the United States, as partisans of both parties dislike one another more and have stronger negative emotional reactions to the other side, said Eva Anduiza, professor of political science at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. This “affective polarization” is something that’s been measured by the American National Election Study’s “feelings thermometer” since the late 1970s. The survey asks respondents to rate their feelings about “Democrats” and “Republicans” on a 100-point scale and then compares how people rate the party they identify with vs. the one they don’t.
Since 1980, our average feelings about “the other guys” have become significantly chilly — falling from around 50 to around 25 points on the 100-point scale. In fact, almost all the significant increase in affective polarization is due to an increased dislike of the other side and not, say, an increased preference for your own side.
That kind of emotional partisanship matters for scandals because it increases the likelihood of motivated reasoning — basically upping our tendency to not want to hear things that contradict our previously held beliefs. In the case of politics, that means finding reasons why the other side’s scandals are a very big deal and/or finding reasons why our own preferred party’s scandals are not.
“People who are strong partisans will tend to have the blinkers on,” said Elisabeth Gidengil, professor of political science at McGill University in Canada. “They’ll try to discount what’s happening and say it’s not that serious. All the parties do this.” And she does mean all. Gidengil has found evidence of this effect in Canadian politics. Anduiza has seen it in Spain. Vivyan in the U.K. If it’s happening in multiple countries to many different political parties, you might be forced to accept that it’s also something you and your fellow partisans might be doing right here in the good old US of A.
There’s evidence political partisanship can make you more biased against others than racism does, at least in some circumstances. Nyhan even thinks this partisan affective polarization could be behind conflicting research that sometimes suggests the people who know the most about a controversial issue like climate change or a presidential scandal are more likely to dig in their heels and refuse to change their minds even in the face of new evidence. It’s not that knowing more details of a case makes you less willing to change your mind, he said. It’s more that the people who are the most affectively polarized to begin with also have the most reason to pay attention to the news. Maybe they know the details not because they’re doing thoughtful, unbiased observation, but because they’re keeping close track of the political ballgame and how their team scored points.
Of course, if what you want to hear is that Democrats and Republicans could really join hands and sing together in the spirit of harmony and peace, then all of this is rather disheartening. After all, there are good reasons why some scandals should stick (and others should not), and partisan divides get in the way of finding that middle ground.
But there is some good news. Researchers are finding that there are ways around strong partisan affective polarization — and they don’t even depend upon the two sides coming to an agreement on actual policy. In a 2019 study involving nearly 1,000 political partisans, “warm contact” between political leaders did more to reduce affective polarization and negative opinions about the other party than issue compromise. Maybe if the President wants out of impeachment, it’s time to invite Nancy Pelosi over for pie?",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

From Joel Lewis, this week’s Riddler Classic is a birthday puzzle for the ages:
The classic birthday problem asks about how many people need to be in a room together before you have better-than-even odds that at least two of them have the same birthday. Ignoring leap years, the answer is, paradoxically, only 23 people — fewer than you might intuitively think.
But Joel noticed something interesting about a well-known group of 100 people: In the U.S. Senate, three senators happen to share the same birthday of October 20: Kamala Harris, Brian Schatz and Sheldon Whitehouse.
And so Joel has thrown a new wrinkle into the classic birthday problem. How many people do you need to have better-than-even odds that at least three of them have the same birthday? (Again, ignore leap years.)

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏Fernando Mendez 👏 of San Carlos, California, winner of last week’s Riddler Express.
Last week, you were asked to find the probability of a baseball team winning two of its previous four games and four of its previous eight games, if that team had a 50 percent chance of winning each game.
Solver Amy Leblang tackled this riddle by first looking at the probability of the team winning two of its last four games. If we mark a win with a W and a loss with an L, there are 24, or 16, total ways to write the results of those four games, each with the same probability of occurring. (You get the 2 in the 24 because there are two options: win or lose. And you get the 4 because we’re looking at four games.) But only six of these sequences have exactly two wins: WWLL, WLWL, WLLW, LWWL, LWLW and LLWW. That means the chances of the team winning two of its last four games was 6/16, or 3/8.
If a team has already won two of its last four games, then in order to win four of its last eight, it must have won another two games in the four games immediately preceding the last four. There are 16 ways to write the results of those four games, and six of them will result in exactly two wins, again giving us a result of 3/8.
Putting this all together, the probability of winning two of the last four games and winning four of the last eight is the product of these two probabilities: 3/8×3/8 = 9/64, or a little more than 14 percent of the time.
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏Tom Mahon 👏 of Kingsland, Texas, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic.
Last week, you analyzed three baseball teams: (1) the Mississippi Moonwalkers, whose batters each had a 40 percent chance of walking and a 60 percent chance of striking out; (2) the Delaware Doubloons, whose batters each had a 20 percent chance of doubling — driving in any teammates on base — and an 80 percent chance of striking out; and (3) the Tennessee Taters, whose batters each had a 10 percent chance of hitting a home run and a 90 percent chance of striking out. If these three teams faced each other in a season of baseball, which team was most likely to have the best record?
Riddler Nation was divided over this problem. Among readers who submitted on Friday, more than half said the Moonwalkers would win the most games. But among the slow and steady solvers who submitted solutions over the weekend, more than 70 percent thought the Taters would win the most games. What gives?
Many attacked this riddle by analyzing how many runs each team would score on average, reasoning that more runs would lead to more wins. Solver Michael Campbell found these averages precisely, using techniques from the branch of mathematics known as combinatorics. He found that the Doubloons average only about 2.4 runs per nine innings, the Taters average 3.0 runs per nine innings, and the Moonwalkers average about 3.4 runs per nine innings. From this analysis, it would seem that the Moonwalkers are the best team in Riddler League Baseball.
But not so fast — there was something deeper going on here. Solver Michael Goss took a more direct approach, simulating a million baseball games between each pair of teams. He found that the Taters beat the Doubloons in about 63 percent of games, and that the Taters also beat the Moonwalkers in 51.6 percent of games. From these percentages, solver Jason Ash calculated the average number of wins each team would have in a 162-game season: approximately 93 wins for the Taters, 87 wins for the Moonwalkers and 64 wins for the lowly Doubloons. So on average, the winningest team turns out to be the Taters.
How can a team that scores fewer runs than its opponent win more games? (Such a feat apparently runs counter to baseball’s Pythagorean expectation.) The answer lies in the probability distribution of runs per game. Imagine Team A scores exactly one run every game, while Team B is scoreless in nine games out of 10 but then piles on 20 runs in the remaining games. Team B scores twice as many runs as Team A on average, but Team A will win 90 percent of their head-to-head matchups!
While the math behind the Taters-Moonwalkers matchup was a little more involved, the reasoning was the same. The graph below shows the run differential in 1 million simulated matchups between the Taters and the Moonwalkers. While the Moonwalkers were more likely to light up the scoreboard, as shown by the graph’s longer left tail, the Taters won a slight majority of the games, often by just one or two runs.
This is definitely a case for the long ball over small ball. (I sure hope Ned Yost isn’t reading this.)

You develop an even better once-in-a-generation talent. (So maybe that’s “twice-in-a-generation”?) The Washington Nationals might have done just that.
For many, Tuesday’s National League Wild Card game was likely their first exposure to Washington wunderkind Juan Soto, who introduced himself with a game-winning hit.1 But the Nationals’ 20-year-old star has already established himself as one of the best players in the game.
Soto has been historically good through his first two seasons in the major leagues. One MLB scout told me recently that there can be only one comp for Soto through his first two years in the majors: Ted Williams.
Hyperbole? Perhaps. We don’t know for sure how the rest of Soto’s career will unfold. But look at Soto’s production compared to other players’ through their age 20 seasons and you can see where the scout is coming from.
In the history of the major leagues, covering all years from 1871 through 2019 via the Baseball-Reference.com database, there have been only eight seasons in which a player 20 years old or younger has recorded better than a .400 on-base percentage (an elite rate of avoiding outs).2 Soto has authored two of those eight seasons.

As for overall performance, only nine other players have accrued more wins above replacement through their age-20 season (Soto has posted 7.6 WAR so far). Harper, though his performance and trajectory has cooled in recent seasons, is one of them; the other names include the likes of Ty Cobb, Mickey Mantle, Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr., a group composed almost entirely of Hall of Famers and elite talents.
What makes Soto, who signed with the Nationals in 2016 as a 17-year-old out of the Dominican Republic, so effective? His ability to combine patience and power at the plate, along with his quality of contact, is extraordinary for such a young player.
Consider that among players who have a slugging percentage over .500 this season, Soto has the eighth lowest out-of-zone swing rate.3 Not only does Soto have considerable power, he also has an uncanny feel for the strike zone. Pitchers cannot get him to chase.
What’s more, he rarely whiffs when he swings, and he rarely makes weak contact — he has the 15th-lowest infield pop-up rate this season among qualified hitters. It’s nearly the perfect blend of hitting skills, and he’s doing it all at an age when most players are still in A-ball. (Soto spent just 122 games in the minors before his debut last season.)
In all, Soto has helped Nationals fans forget about Harper, whose Phillies did not make the playoffs this season. While Harper was a good player in Washington — and a great player in 2015 when he won the NL MVP — he perhaps never lived up to the lofty expectations fueled by his pedigree and early performance. He didn’t become the NL’s Mike Trout. But the Nats could still get that; Soto has a chance to become a face-of-the-franchise — perhaps eventually a face-of-the-game — talent.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/would-warren-or-sanders-move-to-the-center-against-trump/,2019-10-02,,,features,"Oct. 1, 2019",Would Elizabeth Warren Or Bernie Sanders Move To The Center Against Trump?,Perry Bacon Jr.,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Several of Joe Biden’s top rivals in the 2020 Democratic primary are presenting themselves as more liberal on policy issues than the former vice president. But if Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris were to win the nomination, would they reposition themselves to appeal to more centrist voters in a general election?
This is an important question in the context of the Democratic primary. Some more centrist Democrats are worried that Sanders and Warren in particular are taking left-wing positions in the primary that will hurt them in the general election. So those Democrats might be reassured by the idea that these candidates would move right after the primary. Alternatively, some very liberal Democrats are worried that Harris and Warren aren’t truly committed to left-wing goals like Medicare-for-All. Is it likely that they would abandon their liberal stances after the primary?
If history is any indication, the Democratic candidates will move to the center, but not in the most obvious way. They won’t abandon core liberal policy stands. But they will both speak about themselves and their policy views in more moderate ways and choose a running mate aimed at appealing to voters who are not hardcore liberals.
How Recent Nominees Have Shifted From The Primary To The General Election 
Let’s start with policy. Recent Democratic presidential nominees have not moved to the center on major policy issues in the general election. In 2008, Barack Obama did not retreat from high-profile liberal promises such as proposing the withdrawal of most U.S. troops from Iraq and a comprehensive plan to provide more Americans health insurance. In the 2016 general election, Hillary Clinton stuck with a fairly unpopular stance on abortion that she took in the Democratic primary — the repeal of the Hyde Amendment that bars federal funding from being used for abortion services.
A paper written last year for the journal “American Politics Research” by scholars Brice Acree, Justin Gross, Noah Smith, Yanchuan Sim and Amber Boydstun studied this in a more systematic way and found the pattern of sticking with your core policy promises from the primary extended to recent Republican nominees as well.
Why aren’t the nominees flipping away from bold policy stances in the general election? First of all, a candidate often makes promises during a primary to appeal to particular constituencies. The candidate usually will need those same groups to be strongly behind him or her in the general election. (For example, Obama embraced universal health care during the 2008 primary in part to appeal to the leaders of major labor unions.) Also, flip-flopping on your core stances is likely to draw negative press coverage. Finally, recent Democratic nominees (Clinton, Obama, John Kerry and Al Gore) didn’t center their candidacies in the primary around the idea that they were the most liberal Democrat. So those four arguably didn’t take as many bold and potentially electorally risky stances as Warren and Sanders, who have made liberalism a centerpiece of their presidential runs.
But Democratic nominees in the past have made other concessions to the idea of “middle of the road” voters. The most prominent one has tended to be in their picks for vice president. The four most recent Democratic nominees all chose running mates whose role was in part to help the person at the top of the ticket appeal to more conservative voters.1 In all four cases, the vice-presidential candidate was to the right of the Democratic nominee as measured by roll call votes in Congress, according to a paper written last year by Northeastern Illinois University’s William Adler and FiveThirtyEight contributor and Marquette University political science professor Julia Azari.2 And each VP pick also had less measurable “moderate” calling cards:
In 2000, Gore picked Joe Lieberman, who had been one of the most high-profile Democratic critics of Bill Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
In 2004, Kerry picked John Edwards, who was a senator from the South (North Carolina) and had a distinct Southern drawl.
In 2008, Obama picked Joe Biden, a white man who speaks often about his Catholic faith.
In 2016, Clinton picked Tim Kaine, a white man who speaks often about his Catholic faith.
I’m not suggesting that on policy issues there was a lot of daylight between Clinton and Kaine or Obama and Biden. (There wasn’t.) But American voters aren’t that well-versed in policy in the first place. Obama (black) and Clinton (female) have identities that are associated by voters with liberalism. One way to soften the perception that Clinton and Obama were very liberal was to pick a white guy as their running mates. (In fact, Kaine was on Obama’s short list for vice-president eight years before Clinton picked him.)
Clinton, Kerry and Obama, in particular, also made other choices — in terms of tone and messaging — to present themselves as more centrist in the general election. (This is admittedly more subjective and harder to measure.) For example, in the general election, Clinton emphasized the Republicans who endorsed her. Kerry made his military service a centerpiece of his general election campaign. Obama used the phrase “middle class” much more often during the general election, compared to the primary, according to Acree, Gross, Smith, Sim and Boydstun; he also invoked the concept of “universal health care” much less often in the general election, compared to the primary.
What Might Warren, Sanders Or Harris Do? 
So what do these precedents tell us about how Harris, Sanders and Warren might act in a general election? First, we shouldn’t expect these candidates to truly back away from any of their signature policy ideas, such as the taxes on wealth proposed by Sanders and Warren, Sanders’s mass forgiveness of college debt or Harris and Sanders’s proposals to create Medicare-style health care options for basically every American. Breaking away from such high-profile ideas would leave them vulnerable to charges of flip-flopping and probably irritate their core supporters.3
Could they nibble at the edges? Sure. Perhaps Sanders tweaks his health care approach so at least some Americans can stay in their current plans. Maybe Warren releases some kind of middle-class tax cut to emphasize that she wants only to increase rates for the very rich.
But, like with past nominees, it will be easier for these candidates to present themselves as more moderate in a general election through shifts in tone and their vice-presidential picks rather than moving right on policy. If Harris or Warren is the Democratic nominee, I would expect either Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio or Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio (or both) will be on their short lists for vice-president. (Brown and Ryan are white men from the Midwest who aren’t known as super liberal.) Following this model, a natural running mate choice for Sanders would be Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. (I doubt the Democratic ticket will be two men. So Whitmer fits the bill as a woman who is fairly moderate and from the Midwest.)
In a general election, you could see Warren downplaying her bold, liberal plans on every issue a bit and putting more emphasis on her Christianity, Oklahoma roots and bipartisan work in the Senate. Sanders, who has had to play up his ties to the Democratic Party in the primary, would likely go back to noting that he is officially an Independent who has some frustrations with both parties, just as a lot of voters do. Harris might downplay her more divisive stands, like her support of impeaching Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and opt for more Obama-style rhetoric about unifying the country across gender, racial and religious lines.
All that said, there are also a couple of reasons to think the Democratic nominee in 2020 might make less of an “etch-a-sketch” effort than past nominees. The previous Democratic presidential nominees were all in some ways following a kind of “median voter’ model, imagining that there was a set of voters whose views were basically in between the positions of the Democrats and the Republicans. But there is a lot of evidence that moderate, swing and independent voters aren’t particularly centrist, but hold a lot of different views, some of which are conservative, some of which are liberal.
So maybe Sanders or Warren, in a general election, keep their populism pretty amped up in an effort to woo voters who may swing between the two parties but would prefer an unabashed economic populist. Maybe Harris, instead of choosing a centrist white man as her running mate, picks Warren — or Warren chooses Harris — and they run a campaign with strongly liberal stands on issues of race and identity, hoping to win the election by energizing voters particularly turned off by Trump’s racialized and racist appeals.
And beyond whatever the winning primary candidate thinks is the best general election strategy, the Democratic Party — which is much more liberal and non-white than it used to be — may not allow them to move to the center all that much. So perhaps one of these three feels compelled to pick a Latino running mate to appeal to that growing bloc in the electorate, for example, rather than someone like Brown or Ryan.
Where does all that leave us? I think that Harris, Sanders and Warren are likely to reframe their candidacies in a general election to broaden their appeal. But I don’t expect that will mean that they take more moderate positions on issues, in the mold of Biden. Their approach is likely to be more subtle, which has advantages for Democrats (the party could get a decidedly liberal person elected president) but also disadvantages (voters might not notice those subtle shifts, and thus view those candidates as too far left and re-elect Trump.)",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

He packed more into his first three years than most do in a career — two SEC titles and three national championship berths, including one in which he watched a dramatic comeback from the sideline, along with a heroic redemption in last season’s SEC championship game. “Everything about it is unique,” Hurts told reporters last spring. “For me, I know it’s happening to a unique person.”
He had already established himself as one of the best quarterbacks in the country, going 26-2 as a starter for Alabama. When he left the Crimson Tide to team up with quarterback guru Lincoln Riley, coach of the four-time reigning Big 12 champion Oklahoma Sooners, there was no way of knowing how the alliance would turn out. Through four games, they’ve been unstoppable.
Hurts lost his starting job at Alabama not because of injuries or inconsistency but because he had committed the very forgivable crime of not keeping pace with breakout star Tua Tagovailoa. Few quarterbacks ever had, judging by Tagovailoa’s 2018 season. In many ways, though, Hurts is matching Tagovailoa now. Last season, Tagovailoa set a Football Bowl Subdivision record with a passing efficiency rating of 199.4. Through one month this season, Tagovailoa’s rating is 225.1, and Hurts’s is 249.9, the highest in the country and on pace for the highest ever.
Hurts also leads the country in total QBR, with a mark of 97.5. He ranks first in yards per play with a staggering 13.2 and is second in total offense with 434.5 yards per game, despite throwing only three fourth-quarter passes in four Alabama-esque blowouts. He is the first player since at least 2004 to start a season with four games of at least 15 passes and at least 14 yards per attempt, and he is also the first in that span to start with a raw QBR above 95 (minimum 15 pass attempts) in four straight games.
Though many other factors are at play, Hurts has raised the stakes on that intense Alabama quarterback competition from last summer: Who wins the Heisman Trophy? (Tagovailoa is the betting favorite at 2-3, followed by Hurts at 4-1.) The national championship? (Tagovailoa and Alabama are No. 1 in ESPN’s FPI; Hurts and Oklahoma are No. 5.) The No. 1 NFL draft choice? (Tagovailoa is considered the better NFL prospect, ranked No. 2 in The Athletic’s list of the top 60 prospects.)
At Oklahoma, Hurts has added to an almost unprecedented run of quarterbacks under Riley’s tutelage, succeeding Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray. The Sooners are the second team since 1947 with back-to-back Heisman Trophy winners (not counting USC’s second in a row, won — and then given up — by Reggie Bush). They’re also the second team in history with back-to-back No. 1 overall draft picks.1 Through four games in 2017, Mayfield’s total QBR was 93.4; through five games (four starts) last season, Murray’s total QBR was 97.0. With his background, Hurts was expected to be Oklahoma’s next great quarterback. But perhaps nobody foresaw just how good he would be.
The big question in football — college and, soon, the NFL — has been this: Is Hurts’s rise a product of his growth or of Riley’s offense? It’s difficult to distinguish, but the answer is probably somewhere in the middle. NFL teams have long coveted Riley for his offensive mind, and his scheme has opened the field for Hurts. “I heard a coach say this years ago: If your system is not a quarterback-friendly system, you need to find a new system,” Riley told FOX Sports last week. This season, 49.4 percent of Hurts’s throws have traveled 10 or more yards downfield, compared with 38.6 percent in 2017, his last full season as a starter; 23.5 percent have traveled 20 or more yards, up from 15.4 percent in 2017. His air yards per attempt are up from 8.33 to 11.42. At the same time, Hurts is a more accurate thrower: He’s been off-target on a minuscule 2.4 percent of passes this season. “I had to do very little fundamentally with him,” Riley said earlier in the season. “I’m not this guy that, in your drop you need to hold it 3 centimeters more to the right. … The guy can either throw it or he can’t.”
The possibility of Alabama-Clemson Part V has dominated the conversation this season, but a Hurts-Tagovailoa, Oklahoma-Alabama showdown — at least in the College Football Playoff semifinals, if not the title game — would be fascinating. Considering the history between the two quarterbacks, it would also be a nice conclusion to both careers.2 By all accounts, the two remained friends throughout their competition at Alabama, as Hurts celebrated Tagovailoa’s comeback in the national championship against Georgia even after the two-year starter had been benched.
When he left, Hurts penned a letter to Alabama in The Players’ Tribune, ending with, “It’s been a great three years. I’ll love you until the end of time!” He remains popular with Alabama locals — even his former coach. After Hurts’s Oklahoma debut, Alabama coach Nick Saban said it “doesn’t surprise me in the least bit” to see Hurts excelling at Oklahoma.
All of this is unheard of — that Oklahoma could have a third-straight transfer win a Heisman; that perhaps the two best quarterbacks in the country played on the same team for two years; and that they may end up owning the two best single-season passer ratings in college football history. With three months left in the season, plenty of challengers could derail this collision course: Oklahoma must still play Texas, Alabama should have to go through Georgia, and then there is the small matter of the reigning national champion Clemson Tigers. But if Hurts was right in his letter, and an ESPN “30 for 30” film does end up documenting his career, it’s likely to have one exciting ending.

In the days following the emergence of allegations that President Trump tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating the former vice president, the Biden campaign has sought to take control of the media narrative. But the parallels between what’s happening now and the controversy over former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server while she served as secretary of state are increasingly clear.
The allegations that Clinton violated laws by sending and receiving classified information through her personal server dogged her campaign and dominated media coverage throughout the 2016 election cycle. The Biden campaign has insisted that the same will not happen to it, telling Politico last week, “We learned.”
Putting distance between Biden and the Ukraine story in the public’s imagination is a tall order, though. Despite the Biden campaign’s best efforts at triaging fallout, members of the Trump administration and others are still calling for investigations into Biden and his son Hunter for their connections to Ukraine. Longtime Clinton adviser Philippe Reines told Politico that the damage is already done, arguing that the connection between Biden and the Ukraine situation has been firmly established. “You can’t say the words ‘Trump’ and ‘Ukraine’ without seeing ‘Biden’ and ‘Ukraine,’” he said.
And the data we have so far seems to bear that out. The Ukraine scandal has thrust Biden squarely into the center of the media spotlight — he saw a huge uptick in 15-second cable news clips last week, getting more mentions than all of the other 2020 Democratic candidates combined. While Biden has tried to steer the media toward asking the “right questions,” Trump has worked to point attention right back at Biden and his son. And as you can see in the chart below, whether viewers heard about the Ukraine story in the context of Biden or Trump may have depended on where they got their news.
Initially, when the Wall Street Journal published its Sept. 20 story detailing a phone call in which Trump allegedly pressured the Ukranian president eight different times to investigate Biden’s son, there were more than twice as many mentions of “Ukraine” on MSNBC than on Fox News. CNN devoted more airtime to the story, too, but as you can see in the chart above, this quickly changed: By the time House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the opening of an official impeachment inquiry four days later, the networks were mentioning “Ukraine” at about the same frequency, albeit in different contexts. Recently, MSNBC and CNN have both discussed the Ukraine story in the context of Trump, while Fox News remained more focused on Biden.
We also examined the top one- or two-word keywords in the 15-second clips that mentioned “Ukraine” to better understand the substance of each network’s media coverage. And as you can see in the table below, the narratives were pretty different — CNN’s coverage was much more likely to focus on the breaking news aspect of the story (the phrase “breaking news” was actually the third most likely to be used by CNN in conjunction with “Ukraine” versus other networks). Fox News focused more on “Hillary Clinton” and “Hunter Biden,” while MSNBC focused heavily on “Donald Trump.”

We used a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to estimate, for each word, the probability of being used on each network. The 20 most predictive words for each network (i.e. the ones that most distinguish each network’s coverage) are shown here. We excluded filler words such as “a” and “the” as well as the names of the networks themselves, and words that appeared less than 50 times overall.
Fox News has discussed Hunter Biden’s ties to a gas company in Ukraine — as well his ties to China — more than the other outlets. It frequently mentioned “Hillary Clinton,” and the idea that she, too, might have shadowy connections to Ukraine. Fox also used the phrase “quid pro quo” more often than the other networks, with most coverage pointing out that Trump did not explicitly ask for a “quid pro quo” or promise Zelensky foreign assistance for Ukrainian cooperation.
Meanwhile, MSNBC has centered its media narrative on Trump and the possibility of presidential wrongdoing. It repeatedly described Trump’s request to Zelensky to investigate Biden as “digging up dirt.”1 In total, the phrase was used 38 different times on MSNBC, 27 times on CNN and just seven times on Fox News. MSNBC also emphasized the role of Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, more than the other networks, often referring to him by his role rather than his name.
As accusations that Trump used the power of the presidency to seek dirt on his political rival ricochet through the media, the news cycles have been moving fast. Though there remain a lot of unanswered questions, like whether the House will actually move to vote on articles of impeachment, one thing should be abundantly clear: there is a media tug-of-war brewing between Biden and Trump, and each of them is working hard to pin the Ukraine controversy on the other. How the public thinks about Trump or Biden may depend largely on who can wrest control of the media narrative. But if the networks diverge in their coverage, there may be more than one media narrative to win.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

84.6 percent
Media coverage of the 2020 Democratic primary candidates has become hyper-concentrated on former Vice President Joe Biden. Last week, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, data from TV News Archive and Media Cloud showed that Biden was mentioned in a higher share of 15-second cable news clips (74.3 percent) and online stories (84.6 percent) about the Democratic race than all of the other candidates combined.

Bear 409
Bear 409, a beloved brown bear nicknamed “Beadnose” became a social media sensation last year before winning Katmai National Park’s Fat Bear Week. However, the plump and previously healthy bear has not been spotted at all this year, which is why she’s not in the 2019 bracket of salmon-eating competitors. The bear is now in her 20s, which puts her at the end of a brown bear’s average lifespan, and up until now she has returned to the Brooks River, where the bear cam is located, every year. Park staff say Beadnose’s disappearance could be due to failing health, harsh winter conditions, or simply a move to another part of the wilderness. [Mashable]
$6 million settlement
A civil rights lawsuit regarding the abusive treatment and neglect of several developmentally disabled adults in a group home has resulted in a New York state settlement of $6 million. Five years ago, reports of workers mistreating residents became public; staff members at the Bronx facility were accused of hitting and kicking residents, spitting in their faces, and giving them black eyes and other bruises. The lawsuit also alleges that when the sister of one resident called the group home, a worker answered, “Good morning, Bronx Zoo.” [The New York Times]
69-month auto loan
The growing size of auto loans and the pursuit of manageable monthly payments has led many U.S. borrowers to agree to stretched loan terms of six, seven, even nine years, according to credit reporting firm Experian. The average term of an auto loan is now 69 months, a record, resulting in many car buyers trading in their vehicles before fully paying off their debts. The Federal Reserve says after the recession, auto loan debt among U.S. consumers swelled to $1.3 trillion at the end of June 2019, up from about $740 billion a decade earlier.

1,000 dolphins
Fifty years ago, the Potomac River was so polluted that President Lyndon B. Johnson called it a “national disgrace.” One sign that the waterway may now be much cleaner is that a fast-growing population of bottlenose dolphins has been observed near Reedville, Virginia. After identifying about 200 of the distinctive swimmers in 2015, researchers have now counted well over 1,000, and even gotten evidence of a rarely observed dolphin birth. [The Washington Post]
290 freed detainees
On Monday, Yemen’s rebels, known as Houthis, released 290 detainees. Most of the prisoners had been held since 2014, after the Houthis overran the capital city of Sanaa and pushed out the country’s internationally recognized government. This political moment ushered in a civil war that has killed thousands, with millions of other Yemenis suffering from food shortages and lack of medical care.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-do-black-democrats-usually-prefer-establishment-candidates/,2019-10-02,,,features,"Oct. 2, 2019",Why Black Voters Prefer Establishment Candidates Over Liberal Alternatives,Perry Bacon Jr.,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Black voters effectively delivered Hillary Clinton the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. She and Sen. Bernie Sanders ran about evenly among white voters, but black voters overwhelmingly backed Clinton. So did the Democratic establishment.
That team-up — black voters and the more establishment candidate — is not unusual.
We don’t have detailed exit polls of Democratic primaries for most other offices, but according to pre-election polls and precinct results in a number of high-profile House and gubernatorial primaries since 2016, black voters have tended to back the candidate from the party’s establishment wing over a more liberal alternative. And at least for now, we’re seeing the same pattern in the 2020 Democratic presidential race: Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Sanders are fairly competitive with Joe Biden among white Democrats, but trail the former vice president substantially among black Democrats.
Why, though? After all, African Americans have dramatically less income and wealth than white Americans, so messages of “big, structural change” (Warren) or a “political revolution” (Sanders) should, in theory, be particularly appealing. Because a higher percentage of black Americans than white Americans don’t have health insurance, a program like Medicare for All, for example, would disproportionately benefit black people.
So what gives? I’m going to offer some potential answers to that question, but let’s first get a couple caveats and complications out of the way.
First, it’s hard to come up with a definitive explanation for the establishment-black voter alliance because the “establishment” is a fuzzy concept. Exactly which candidate is a center-left, establishment Democrat and which is anti-establishment or “the liberal alternative” is all a bit subjective.
Second — and this is important — black Democrats are not a monolith and are divided in some of the same ways white Democrats are divided. Young black voters are less supportive of Biden (and were less supportive of Clinton in 2016) compared to older black voters. Similarly, black voters without college degrees are more supportive of Biden than those with degrees.
That said, blacks of all demographics are more supportive of Biden than their white counterparts, according to Morning Consult polling data. Young black voters are more supportive of Biden (and were more supportive of Clinton) than young white voters. Older black voters were more supportive of Clinton than older white ones in 2016 and now are strongly behind Biden. Black college graduates are more supportive of Biden than white college graduates. Nuances aside, the weakness of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party with black voters is a well-known phenomenon that people in the Warren and Sanders camps and anti-establishment liberal activist groups are openly grappling with.
So here are a few explanations for why black voters have tended to side with the establishment wing of the Democratic Party. I have tried to order these explanations from strongest to weakest (in my view, at least):
1. Establishment candidates typically have existing ties to the black community
This will sound tautological, but an establishment candidate is … well … established. A candidate who is part of the establishment wing of the Democratic Party likely has fairly strong ties to major constituencies in the party, such as labor unions, women’s rights groups and, of course, black leaders and voters. So when black voters backed Gov. Andrew Cuomo over Cynthia Nixon in New York’s Democratic gubernatorial primary last year, or Andy Beshear over Adam Edelen in Kentucky’s Democratic gubernatorial primary earlier this year, that was not shocking. Not only did Beshear and Cuomo spend years developing their own ties with the black communities in their states, but their fathers did, too. (Steve Beshear was governor of Kentucky, Mario Cuomo the governor of New York.)
Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020 similarly entered the primaries with longstanding ties to black voters. It’s worth considering if the story here is not that establishment candidates are smarter in appealing and connecting with black voters during the campaign, compared to anti-establishment candidates. Maybe it’s that the establishment candidate in a race is likely to be the person who enters the campaign with the strongest support among black voters.
2. Black voters are pragmatic
White Democrats are significantly more likely than black Democrats to describe themselves as liberal. Perhaps that’s the simple explanation for why most black voters eschew more liberal candidates. But scholars of black voters argue that the liberal-moderate-conservative framework does not apply well to predicting the actual policy positions and voting behavior of black Americans.
In other words, it’s not clear that “moderate” black Democrats are moderate in the way that the word is most often invoked in white-dominated, elite settings, such as cable news and Twitter. They’re not demanding David Brooks-style centrism on economic and cultural policy. If, for instance, Biden endorsed Medicare for All and the elimination of most private insurance plans — the position of Sanders and Warren — I think it’s likely that black voters who like Biden would begin to feel more favorable about Medicare for All rather than breaking with Biden to find an anti-Medicare-for All candidate. Similarly, if Biden were out of the race, I’m skeptical that much of his support among black voters would go to Mayor Pete Buttigieg or Sen. Amy Klobuchar who are also positioning themselves as centrists on policy issues.
“The fact that blacks describe themselves as moderate or conservative on these measures is virtually meaningless, and results mostly from the fact that these ideological labels carry such little currency among black voters,” Hakeem Jefferson, a political scientist at Stanford University who studies black political attitudes, told me.
Instead, in interviews with black Democrats in 2016 and 2020, I’ve seen more pragmatism than moderation. In 2016, black primary voters were very fearful of Trump getting elected and felt Clinton was the best person to face him in a general election. They were skeptical that the broader electorate would like Sanders’s farther-reaching ideas, and even more doubtful Sanders could execute them if elected. During the 2020 cycle, black voters have regularly told reporters that they like Sen. Kamala Harris and other Democratic candidates but view Biden as the person most likely to defeat Trump.
Why would black Democrats be more pragmatic than white Democratic voters? In interviews, black voters often suggest they have a lot to lose if a Republican takes office. They don’t necessarily say this explicitly, but the implication is that they have more to lose than white voters, making them more risk-averse. That’s at least partially true. A higher percentage of black Americans (compared to white Americans) use government programs like Medicaid, for example, so cuts to those programs by Republicans are more likely to affect blacks than whites.
“On doorsteps in South Carolina, black voters sensibly asked me why I thought Bernie Sanders could accomplish more than Obama, whom the Republicans had done everything they could to stop,” wrote Ted Fertik, in a study of the Vermont senator’s campaign.1
“They saw no reason to believe that Sanders would be more effective, and given the fulminating racism of so many leading Republicans, they sensibly felt that the costs of a Republican presidency would fall more heavily on them,” he added. “They were therefore not inclined to take a risk on Bernie Sanders … even when they agreed with his proposals.”
3. Black leaders are part of the establishment and support its candidates
This is a slightly different point than No. 1, above. It’s not just that Sanders in 2016 and Warren in 2020 entered those races with weaker connections to black leaders than Clinton or Biden. During the primary process, black leaders weighed in — on the side of the establishment candidate.
In February 2016, fairly early in the primary season, the Congressional Black Caucus’s PAC formally endorsed Clinton. Eight black caucus members have endorsed Biden this year. None are behind Warren or Sanders. You might say that politicians just like to endorse front-runners, so they can be on the side of the winner. Not quite. Ten black caucus members have backed Harris, another candidate whose politics are best described as center-left establishment. (More on her in a bit.) And Biden and Harris are also getting the vast majority of endorsements from other high-profile black figures, such as state representatives and prominent mayors.
Why are elected black officials more likely to side with establishment candidates? Many of these candidates have long courted black community leaders, including elected officials, as I mentioned in No. 1. But I also think it’s the case that many black Democratic elites spent much of the last several decades courting the establishment, and are thus tied to it. You see this on Capitol Hill, where black House members are among the strongest defenders of Speaker Nancy Pelosi in her internal battles with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and the progressive wing of the House. Black elites also express the same pragmatism that black voters do and are wary of pushing forward candidates they view as unable to win a general election.
It’s not clear that black voters follow high-profile endorsers. That said, the lack of high-profile black support for Sanders, Warren and other anti-establishment Democrats creates a self-reinforcing problem. They don’t have much support among black voters or black elites, so the press covers their lack of black support. A candidate defined by the press as lacking black support is going to have a hard time getting black voters to support her or black elites to endorse her.
4. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party appeals to the well-educated more than other groups, and the vast majority of black Democrats don’t have college degrees
Education has become an increasingly powerful predictor of voting behavior in U.S. politics in recent years. That’s proving true in 2020 as well. Warren, in particular, has significantly more support among Democrats with college degrees than those without them. But if education is a dividing line, it’s likely to divide white and black Democrats. Only about 24 percent of black Democrats have college degrees, compared to about 42 percent of white Democrats, according to Gallup data.
In other words, the alliance between black voters and establishment candidates may be partly about education, not race. Perhaps Warren’s limited support among black Americans is simply indicative of her broader challenge with people without college degrees.
We don’t have great data about how Sanders or other liberal Democrats did among black college graduates compared to non-college educated black voters, so I’m reluctant to emphasize this point too much. But there is a lot of evidence that the activist left wing of the Democratic Party is more educated than the rest of the party and perhaps is not connecting with voters — both black and non-black — who don’t have degrees.
5. The left wing isn’t running enough black candidates
There is some evidence that African Americans are more likely to turn out to vote if there is a black candidate. (These studies are generally of general elections of congressional races, so they’re not perfectly analogous to a presidential primary.) In recent Democratic primaries, the candidate who is well-liked by the white liberal activist wing of the Democratic Party has struggled with black voters (Bill Bradley in 2000, Howard Dean in 2004, Sanders in 2016, Sanders and Warren in 2020.) The exceptions were two black candidates: Jesse Jackson in 1988 and Barack Obama in 2008.2
So it would probably be helpful if the liberal wing of the Democratic Party was running more black candidates. It’s not that the liberal bloc of the party has no prominent black voices. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts is a part of the Ocasio-Cortez bloc on Capitol Hill. Andrew Gillum ran to the left and defeated a more establishment candidate in last year’s Democratic primary for governor in Florida, with black voters playing a key role in his victory.
But aspiring black politicians often need to downplay their liberalism to advance in elected office so that they can seem “electable” in a general election. This probably rules out some black candidates — Sens. Cory Booker and Harris, potentially — from becoming “liberal alternatives.” You might say that’s a problem for Booker and Harris, who are trailing Warren and Sanders in most polls. But it’s a problem for the anti-establishment wing of the Democratic Party, too. If the anti-establishment wing of the party were backing a black candidate in 2020, that person would likely present a stronger challenge to Biden, because he or she could more easily cut into his advantage among black voters.


We could come up with some other explanations, but I think those are the strongest. And this analysis points to a blueprint for the left wing of the Democratic Party if it wants to win more black votes:
Align with black candidates or non-black candidates with strong ties to black voters and leaders
Aggressively court black leaders for endorsements
Directly address black voters’ concerns that more liberal candidates have a greater chance of losing races to Republicans
And target black voters under 45 and those with college degrees, who might be less inclined to vote for establishment candidates.
So could that approach work for Sanders and Warren against Biden? Maybe. You could imagine Warren in particular getting endorsements from younger liberal black figures like Gillum or Pressley (particularly if Warren wins one of the early primary states and Harris finishes far behind and is no longer viable). And maybe those endorsements and Warren’s campaigning then lead her to become the candidate of black voters under 45 and those with college degrees, even if Biden still gets most votes from older and less educated black voters.
Remember, Sanders or Warren don’t necessarily have to win the black vote to become the Democratic nominee — they just can’t lose it by 60 percentage points, as Sanders did in 2016. (Biden is getting between 40 and 50 percent of the black vote in most polls now, so nowhere near Clinton 2016 levels. But Clinton was in a two-candidate field, and I would expect Biden’s support among black voters to go up as this gigantic field shrinks.)
But even if Sanders or Warren gets more support among black voters in 2020 than the Vermont senator did in 2016, I tend to think Biden will remain fairly popular with black voters overall — because of his ties to Obama and other black leaders and the perception that he can defeat Trump. So there is a very real possibility that black voters will play the same role in the 2020 presidential primary that they have played in Democratic politics over much of the last four years: blocking the path of the liberal left as it attempts to dethrone the party’s establishment.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Of the 15 teams with the lowest preseason playoff probabilities, per FiveThirtyEight’s predictions, only the Oakland A’s exceeded 50 percent playoff odds at any point in the season. (The A’s, who opened the season with the 16th-best playoff odds, are the only team from the bottom half of our preseason predictions to earn a postseason berth.) The only other bottom-half clubs that exceeded 40 percent playoff odds at any point in the season were the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Seattle Mariners. The Diamondbacks spent eight days with 40 percent or greater odds, topping out at 48.2 percent on May 4. The Mariners reached season-high playoff odds of 40.8 percent on April 11, and then quickly faded.
Teams that started in the top half of our playoff predictions rarely saw their playoff probabilities fall below those of the bottom half. In the American League, the division-winning Houston Astros, New York Yankees and Minnesota Twins enjoyed strong playoff probabilities for much of the season.1
FanGraphs produced a similar pattern with its playoff probabilities — and even did a little better than ours: Their preseason bottom 15 included the Colorado Rockies, who were 15th in our preseason rankings, and excluded the A’s.

I continue to be amazed by this pre-season forecast at @fangraphs . The bottom 15 teams forecasted, all at under 25%, never exceeded 30% chance at any point in the season. And are the bottom 15 of 16 teams to make the playoffs right now. (Redsox joining the crew.) pic.twitter.com/zBzftlso3X

MLB’s postseason field expanded in 2012. But even with the double-wild-card format and 10 total postseason berths, there wasn’t much drama this September. As of Sept. 13, eight teams had either clinched playoff berths or had 90 percent or greater playoff odds and would go on to clinch. Only the AL wild-card race and NL Central crown were up for grabs in the final week, and the runner-up in the NL Central — either the Milwaukee Brewers or the St. Louis Cardinals — was guaranteed a wild-card berth.
By some measures, there has never been a greater divide between the baseball Haves and Have Nots. The super teams and tanking teams have taken over: For the first time in MLB history, four teams recorded 100-plus wins in a season, with the Astros, Yankees and Twins eclipsing the mark to capture their respective divisions in the AL and the Dodgers surpassing it in the NL. And for the second time in MLB history, there were four 100-plus loss teams in a season.2
Super teams like the Dodgers and Astros have astutely acquired talent and become player development machines. Meanwhile, tanking has become more tolerated, in part because the Astros and Cubs offered models to follow, using premium draft picks accrued from 100-plus loss seasons to help build championship clubs.
And perhaps these trends also make for more predictable October baseball. The last three World Series champions each won 100-plus games in the regular season preceding their title. The Astros and Dodgers are the favorites to meet in the World Series, as they did in 2017. If they do, it will make the MLB postseason finale feel like an inevitable conclusion to an incredibly predictable season.

The Bucs dropped 55 on the defending NFC champion Rams; the Panthers, Raiders, Browns and Titans all scored road upsets; the Lions even came close to beating Patrick Mahomes and the mighty Chiefs. Just as the pack came roaring past the quarter-pole of the Super Bowl race, the horses kicked up a bunch of dirt — and now we can’t see the track anymore.1
The first three weeks of the season had, in fact, been comparatively normal. The Brier score between actual game results and pregame win probabilities (according to our Elo model, which assigns each team a power rating and adjusts for quarterback injuries) was a modest 0.209. That ranked 14th-lowest — lower means smaller errors — among seasons since the 1970 AFL merger in terms of accuracy through Week 3. Sure, there were some unexpected breakouts (hello, Bills and Lions!) and disappointments (Eagles, Browns, etc.), and starting quarterbacks were dropping like flies. But even through all the QB chaos, the NFL hadn’t started a season this predictably in years:

But this past weekend changed all that. Week 4’s Brier score of 0.310 made it — coincidentally enough — the 14th-least predictable individual week of any NFL season since 1970:

Here’s a rundown of the games that contributed most to the off-target predictions — and what information we might legitimately glean from them:
Tampa Bay over L.A. Rams: The biggest miss for the model was easily the Bucs’ aforementioned 55-40 victory over the Rams on Sunday afternoon, in which we gave them only a 17 percent chance to win. It’s easy to read too much into such an aberrant result, in both directions. For L.A., the defensive numbers are eye-catchingly bad: In addition to the 55 points allowed, their -19.0 defensive expected points added (EPA) represented the sixth-worst game by any defense so far this year. But on the season, L.A.’s defense has still been roughly as good (11th in the league by EPA) as it was last year (13th). The larger takeaway from the game might be that the Bucs’ offense is for real. The team now ranks third in offensive EPA per game after adjusting for opponent quality and second (granted, far behind the Chiefs) in adjusted EPA specifically via the pass.
Carolina over Houston: Elo gave Kyle Allen and the Panthers just a 22 percent chance of going into Houston and knocking off the Texans, but instead they never trailed en route to the 16-10 win. Both of these teams are difficult to figure out: Carolina has been much better (+9.3 total adjusted EPA per game) in the two games Allen started than in the two games started by the sixth-highest-paid quarterback in the game, Cam Newton (-2.8 EPA per game). And the Panthers defense gave a lot of trouble to Deshaun Watston, forcing him into his second terrible start in his past three games. Watson now ranks just 10th in our Elo QB ratings after ranking sixth going into the season, and the Texans (with a 29 percent chance of winning the AFC South) are just about the most tenuous division favorites possible.
Oakland over Indianapolis: Our model had the Colts as heavy home favorites (73 percent) over the Raiders — not unreasonable, since Indy’s Jacoby Brissett played well in a Week 3 win over the Falcons while Oakland’s defense looked horrible against the Vikings. But lo and behold, the Raider D showed up, QB Derek Carr played well enough to win, and Oakland earned the 31-24 upset. So what did we learn about both teams? Maybe just that they’re deeply mediocre, along with many other squads this year. Including Indy and Oakland, 13 teams currently have a record of 2-2, which is tied with the 2010, 2014 and 2017 seasons for the most 2-2 teams through a Week 4 since 1970.
Cleveland over Baltimore: After divergent starts to the season — Lamar Jackson and the Ravens looked surprisingly great, Baker Mayfield and the Browns looked disappointingly meh — it wasn’t shocking to see Baltimore installed as 72 percent favorites over Cleveland. What was shocking, however, was how well the Browns played on both sides of the ball in their 40-25 win. The Ravens offense was held below their usual EPA output, while Mayfield broke out of his slump as the Browns offense had its best game of the season by far. Mayfield was streaky last season as well, so he could be turning a corner, but the bigger concern is probably with Baltimore’s defense. A year removed from ranking fourth-best in EPA, it ranks sixth-worst this season after suffering the fourth-worst defensive EPA game of the season (-20.3 EPA) thus far.
And that doesn’t even get into the other weirdness of the week, which included Detroit’s near-upset of Kansas City (a result that ended up helping Week 4’s Brier score because K.C. had a 67 percent chance of winning). All told, Week 4 proved once again that we never know as much about the NFL as we think we do — and it probably won’t be the last time we have to relearn that lesson before the season is over.
Looking Ahead: Week 5
Best matchup: No. 3 L.A. Rams at No. 7 Seattle (-1.5), 8:20 p.m. ET ThursdayMatchup quality: 89th percentile2Matchup evenness: 83rd percentile
We’ve written before that Thursday Night Football is often used as a dumping ground for the NFL’s ugliest, most unwanted matchups. But that hasn’t really been true so far this season, as the TNF slate has also contained a surprising number of marquee games, at least on paper.3 And in no week is that more true than Week 5, when the Rams and Seahawks find themselves on a weeknight collision course. Los Angeles is fresh off that stunning loss to the Bucs (see above), while Seattle is just a few weeks removed from a perplexing home loss to the Saints and backup QB Teddy Bridgewater. Still, these are two of the best teams in football according to Elo, and our ratings give the Seahawks a slim 55 percent edge to come out on top.

Biggest playoff implications: Rams at SeahawksPotential shift in playoff odds: 30.1 total percentage points
For the first time so far this season, the best/most evenly matched game of the week is also the most important game of the week, in terms of its effect on team playoff probability: Rams versus Seahawks. Both teams are 3-1 at the moment, but Seattle has faced only one NFC West opponent (Arizona, last week), and L.A. hasn’t played any until now. With three teams — the Rams, Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers — bunched between a 25 and 40 percent chance of winning the division, each of these games matters a lot. The Rams currently have better playoff odds than Seattle (68 percent to 49 percent), but that number would change by +/-14.5 percentage points depending on the result of this game. The stakes are even higher for the Seahawks, whose playoff chances would rise to 63 percent with a win or fall to 32 percent with a loss. Although teams with a 3-2 record aren’t doomed, historically speaking, the NFC West is currently tracking for three teams with a 10-6 record or better, so the path to the playoffs for both Seattle and Los Angeles is complicated by the strength of their division.

Home teams are in bold.
The scoring system is nonlinear, so readers’ average points don’t necessarily match the number of points that would be given to the average reader prediction.
After snagging a win over Elo in Week 3, how did the average FiveThirtyEight reader do in the chaos of Week 4? The algorithm picked up some points on the field with its confidence in the Bears, Saints and Steelers, but the readers bought into Minshew Mania and correctly picked Jacksonville to win at Denver, to go with some savvy sliding of the probability sliders in the Carolina-Houston, K.C.-Detroit, Oakland-Indy and New England-Buffalo matchups. That was enough to net the readers their second victory of the season — already more wins than they had all of last season! — by an average margin of 2.7 points.
Congrats to Caleb Nides, who led all readers in Week 4 with 119.5 points, and to Jon Radermacher, whose total of 371.4 points leads the full-season contest. Thanks to everyone who played — and if you haven’t, be sure to get in on the action! You can make picks now and try your luck against Elo, even if you missed Week 4.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-biggest-surprises-from-week-1-of-the-nfl-season/,2019-10-01,,,features,"Sep. 9, 2019",The Biggest Surprises From Week 1 Of The NFL Season,A FiveThirtyEight Chat,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"sara.ziegler (Sara Ziegler, sports editor): It‘s been quite an opening week in the NFL — and that’s just on the field. We started with an old-fashioned defensive slugfest on Thursday and ended Sunday night with the Patriots still looking like the Patriots. And we still have two games left tonight! Throw in a tie for good measure, and the season is off and running.
There was a lot to unpack in Week 1. What were your biggest surprises of the week?
Salfino (Michael Salfino, FiveThirtyEight contributor): I think the Browns are the biggest surprise of Week 1. Not just Baker Mayfield and the offense — because maybe the Titans have a good defense. Who knows at this stage of the season? But the Cleveland defense, which seemed like it was perfectly designed to dominate in the trenches and on the perimeter with the corners, was just shredded. Marcus Mariota had 10.3 yards per attempt, admittedly inflated by a screen pass to Derrick Henry. And the Titans ran the ball well. So it was just a total team collapse by the Browns.
sara.ziegler: I do feel like Cleveland was classically set up for this disappointment. Our model didn’t think the Browns would be nearly as good as everyone else seemed to think they would be.
neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): Yes, we had warned Cleveland fans to kind of pump the brakes before the season. This was a good-looking team by Browns standards, but that’s different from being a good-looking team, period.
Salfino: I know this is a little Narrative Street, but the Browns really set themselves up to be the hunted and not the hunters with all the offseason talk. I don’t know if there’s ever been a team coming off a losing season that had every opponent circling their game on the schedule. Maybe now they will just shut up and play because obviously there is a lot of talent there. Maybe the humiliation on Sunday in Cleveland will actually be good for them, since they needed humbling.
neil: For me, the biggest surprise was Lamar Jackson. He was one of the worst QBs in the league as a rookie last season, and the Ravens adapted their offense to be incredibly run-heavy (particularly by 2018 standards) because he was such a better runner than passer. So to see him come out and throw for 324 yards on 17-for-20 passing, 5 TDs, 0 picks and a perfect 158.3 passer rating was nothing short of astonishing.
You could have told me a QB would do that Week 1, and I would have guessed 25 QBs before Jackson.
Salfino: The tricky thing with this game is whether the Dolphins are the 1962 Mets — or did the Ravens make them look that way? Let’s put it this way: If the Dolphins are trying to lose, they couldn’t have done it any better.
neil: That’s a great point to keep in mind. The Dolphins have been accused of tanking all offseason, and they played like it Sunday.
Incidentally, what’s the opening line on Pats-Dolphins next week? I shudder to think.
Salfino: New England minus-14.5 at Miami, up to 17 now. That would put them among the biggest home underdogs since 1970.
sara.ziegler: And now Miami players are reportedly asking their agents to get them off the team! Not great.
neil: What was your biggest surprise, Sara?
sara.ziegler: Arizona! Loved to see the fight from Kyler Murray and Co.
neil: Fighting back for a TIE, no less.
sara.ziegler: So great.
neil: That’s just fighting back for the love of the game, not the glory. Lol.
Salfino: Murray was Tebowing on Sunday: horrible for most of the game and then turned it on in the fourth quarter. I guess the slow start was opening day jitters. Maybe it was a mistake to not use the regular offense in the preseason.
sara.ziegler: That’s a great point, Mike.
So many of these offenses have looked SOOOOO bad. Maybe a few more reps in the preseason could help?
neil: Maybe this is the year the “rest the starters all preseason” trend jumps the shark.
Salfino: Start with Mitch Trubisky and the Bears.
sara.ziegler: And Aaron Rodgers and the Packers!
neil: That game was SO ugly.
sara.ziegler: It kinda hurt to watch.
neil: Although if they were going for symbolism with the NFL of 100 years ago, they kinda got what they were asking for.
Salfino: Bears-Packers set back offensive football 100 years, so….
sara.ziegler: So true.
Salfino: I just am skeptical about changing the offensive system of an inner-circle Hall of Fame player — especially someone as generally grumpy as Rodgers — with that young of a coach who has not proven anything. How does this work? I would have given Rodgers Mike Shanahan — someone he had to respect — if you want to switch to a Mike Shanahan offense.
sara.ziegler: Our colleague Josh Hermsmeyer wrote about the Packer play-calling that might have been holding Rodgers back last year … but I’m skeptical, too, about changing that on a dime.
Salfino: And it’s kind of like, “Mike Shanahan is standing right here.” But the league is all about young coaches now. Does this work with a 35-year-old QB though? Will the QB, especially this QB, buy in?
sara.ziegler: Hahaha
neil: But at least there, you can use the coaching change as an excuse. Maybe they’ll find more of a rhythm as the season goes on. There were no such excuses for Trubisky’s poor performance.
Salfino: For Trubisky, we kind of know what he is, right? His ability to execute plays that work as designed is definitely below the line. He sort of has to play with his hair on fire, out of structure, so he’s a tough player to design an offense for.
Based on one game, I’d set the Browns over/under at nine wins, the Ravens at 10 and the Cardinals at six. (I mean, it was Matt Patricia blowing a game, right?)
sara.ziegler: Haha
What’s the over/under at Patricia still being the coach in January?
neil: That’s the REAL over/under to worry about.
Salfino: I think Patricia has to be a favorite to be fired in-season. The Dolphins aren’t going to fire a coach. It has to be a team that thinks they’re good with a “franchise” QB, I assume.
neil: The funny thing is, Matt Stafford actually played well overall, with a 110.0 passer rating. But the defense badly collapsed down the stretch.
sara.ziegler: Who else stood out? Philadelphia? Kansas City?
Salfino: I wrote about the impact a downfield weapon has on the entire offense, regarding DeSean Jackson. That certainly was a factor in Sunday’s Eagles win, though Jackson did most of the damage himself. But now the best of these players for Kansas City, Tyreek Hill, is probably out a significant amount of time with a shoulder injury, and I wonder if this will slow down the Chiefs offense. Sammy Watkins was unreal on Sunday, but he did a lot of that damage with Hill in the game. Does the Chiefs offense seem more mortal now?
neil: Not to mention that Pat Mahomes was hobbling around on a bum ankle.
Salfino: And he no-looked away a TD to a wide-open Travis Kelce like he was Meadowlark Lemon.
neil: If Mahomes shakes off any effects of that ankle — and it’s not supposed to be serious — they still have a lot of weapons even without Hill. But they were a team everyone was already wondering about perhaps regressing offensively, just because the highest-scoring offenses usually tend to fall off some in the following season.
sara.ziegler: LeSean McCoy looked decent as one of those weapons.
Salfino: They do seem to have an endless supply of super-athletic players, but Hill really dictates coverage and makes defenses more easy to dissect. The McCoy thing is interesting — Damien Williams still had 65 percent of snaps, compared to just 30 percent for McCoy. But how does Andy Reid tell a guy like McCoy — with over 14,000 scrimmage yards who just outplayed Williams — that he’s sitting behind Williams? I have to think McCoy is the primary back near term for the Chiefs — and he may be washed up, I know.
Speaking of running backs, not a good day for Melvin Gordon.
sara.ziegler: 🤣
Salfino: You want to say that RBs are fungible, but Austin Ekeler is not just an ordinary backup. He’s electric. I think him leading a committee is perfect, and the Chargers are now 5-0 since 2018 without Gordon in the regular season.
sara.ziegler: Not gonna lie: I forgot for a second about the Gordon holdout. The Antonio Brown drama just eclipsed everything.
neil: Austin Ekeler:Melvin Gordon::James Conner:Le’Veon Bell ?
(I think I got my SAT analogy format right there?)
sara.ziegler: Very nice, LOL
Salfino: Well, the Steelers looked like they missed Bell and Brown on Sunday night.
neil: Steelers looked like they missed a lot of things Sunday night.
Salfino: I think the story with the Steelers is that Juju Smith-Schuster is not a downfield wide receiver, and they have no one who can threaten defenses deep like Brown could (even though he was used all over the field). So the Steelers offense looked suffocated on Sunday. There was just no room to breathe.
Ironically, the team on the field that really needs Brown was the Steelers.
sara.ziegler: It was hard to watch that game and not think, “Oh, the Patriots are unstoppable again.”
Salfino: But why even add Brown? I guess it makes sense if you are worried about Josh Gordon’s status, given that he has not completed an NFL season since 2013. But if you know you have Gordon — which of course you can never know — Brown is another mouth to feed and obviously a volatile personality on a team that does not remotely need his talent. Put it this way, if the Patriots had not signed Brown, the story off that game would be, “Of course they shouldn’t have signed Brown because they are a finely tuned machine right now, so why mess with that?”
neil: That’s true. It sort of adds diminishing returns on the field and the potential for chaos off the field. But maybe they wanted extra insurance for Tom Brady at receiver with Gronk retired.
Salfino: Brady is 42. He threw the ball very well, especially deep. But the expectation with an older player is that he will fade as the season progresses. It’s really the Patriots and Brady vs. Father Time. That’s the Battle of the Ages, not New England vs. the NFL.
sara.ziegler: I just assume it’s part of the overall Evil Plan that Patriots always execute to perfection.
neil: I will say this. I have compared Brady’s downfall (whenever it happens) to Peyton Manning’s in 2015, in the sense that when it does happen, it will probably happen very quickly. But for whatever one game is worth, Manning already showed signs of what was to come with a terrible opener that year against Baltimore. Brady, on the other hand, was perfectly fine. So if you’re mentally tracking the odds of a Brady collapse in 2019, those odds had to go down quite a bit just after a game.
Salfino: But what about Peyton in 2014? Isn’t that the example that the Patriots (and Saints) have to fear? That did come all at once. And we ignored it heading into 2015, mostly, attributing it to nagging injuries, which probably was the point. Peyton started 2014 with 22 TDs and three picks in seven games.
neil: True, while Brady was not great in the Super Bowl and had a mediocre game or two down the stretch, he wasn’t consistently struggling late in 2018 as much as Peyton did in 2014. So maybe that does mean the writing was more on the wall for him than Brady, anyway.
Whatever happens, I love Week 1 because we’re all so eager to overreact to every little thing that happens once real football starts. So I wonder which things that seem clear right now will end up looking foolish in a couple months.
sara.ziegler: Can’t wait to find out!

These restrictions come on the heels of a very active free agency period, in which we saw more than $1.4 billion in new deals announced within the first 90 minutes of the formal negotiation period. Today on the show, we break down how these new regulations are likely to impact the league and question whether the league is focused on the right issue.
We’re in the final week of the MLB regular season, and a few wild-card races are coming down to the wire. We take a look at the teams still jockeying for a spot in the postseason and who we see hosting the trophy at the end of it all.

One of the first great medicines of the antibiotic era, sulfanilamide was a miracle drug at a time when curing pneumonia with a quick trip to the pharmacy seemed akin to walking on water. When a sweet, raspberry-flavored liquid version appeared in stores in early September of 1937, it was a no-brainer prescription for doctors whose sick young patients were still picky enough they might reject even Jesus himself if he returned in the form of a bitter-tasting pill.
By the end of October, more than 100 of those patients had died and regulators were scrambling to figure out why.
All of this has happened before, and all of this will happen again. Today, medical experts and federal regulators are struggling to understand a mysterious lung disease linked to the use of electronic cigarettes. As of Sept. 17, 530 people have been diagnosed across the country, seven of whom have died. Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the Food and Drug Administration can definitively say what is causing the illness or why a device that was supposed to help people stop smoking cancer-causing cigarettes has, itself, turned deadly.
Regardless of why e-cigs have turned toxic, historians and consumer law advocates see lessons in the sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 — ones that go beyond the obvious surface similarities of poisonous, fruit-flavored liquids. Both cases highlight the way consumer protections in this country are reactive, cropping up in response to disease and death, rather than preventing it.
“There’s insanely heartbreaking letters from these doctors who had prescribed [sulfanilamide elixir] and then watched kids die,” said Deborah Blum, author of “The Poison Squad,” a book about the founding of the FDA. Those deaths were painful and prolonged, stretching out over days and weeks of convulsions, nausea, kidney failure and stupor. “No one had any idea what was going on. The FDA was desperately sending scientists around the country,” she told me.
Eventually, a Kansas City FDA inspector confirmed that eight children and one adult who died in his area had all taken the same medication, prepared by S.E. Massengill Co., based in Tennessee. Chemists broke the concoction down, molecule by molecule, and discovered that Massengill had blended its antibiotic with diethylene glycol. In other words, it had taken medicine and raspberry flavoring and mixed it up with antifreeze.
A similarly desperate cross-country investigation is happening now with the vaping-related lung deaths, but pinning down a cause is proving harder in this case. There’s no tell-tale chemical turning up in every sample. Eighty-four percent of the 53 patients whose cases were reported in a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine did admit to using e-cigarette pods that contained THC, the chemical in pot that gets you high. But that’s a small and geographically isolated sampling. Other than vaping, itself, there’s no single behavior all the victims share. There’s no Massengill in our modern story, no single company glowing ominously like a lit cigarette in a dark alley.
More frustratingly, said Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, there are several reasons why patients might not be giving doctors an accurate account of what they’ve used and how. Some are too sick. Some might not want to talk to the government about their THC use. The state of Illinois has begun an anonymous survey of healthy e-cigarette users, hoping to spot some differences between the people who have gotten sick and those who haven’t. It’s likely there’s more than one poison at play.
Meanwhile, there’s also not a clear trail of what was sold, who sold it and whom they sold it to. That was true in the 1937 disaster, as well. But investigators knew Massengill had made the product and tried to recall it. E-cigarettes, in contrast, are more of a mom and pop affair. Lots of people are making and selling e-liquids and some of them are amateurs, working off the books. That’s especially true of liquids containing THC.
But this isn’t just about a contaminated black market. Even the e-liquids with the most professional pedigrees haven’t been subject to stringent safety regulations, said Desmond Jensen, an attorney with the Public Health Law Center at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law. In 1937, Blum said, pro-regulation advocates had already been warning people for years that there were too many loopholes in FDA rules. And the same is true in this case. There were no FDA regulations at all on e-cigarettes until 2016, and the regulations that exist now are more like swiss cheese than solid cheddar, Jensen said.
“When you say a product is regulated, the average person thinks about pesticides, food or drugs,” he told me. “There’s someone making sure it’s not tainted, or making sure it won’t make us sick. That’s not what it means here.” Instead, the FDA requires sellers and manufacturers of e-cigarettes and e-liquids to register with and disclose ingredients to the agency. But that isn’t the same as quality or safety testing, Jensen said. And a lot of companies haven’t registered in the two years those regulations have been in effect. Safety testing regulations do exist — but their implementation keeps getting scooched back under pressure from vaping companies. Currently, products that were on the market before 2016 won’t have to be reviewed for safety until May of 2020. Manufacturers who don’t sell directly to consumers haven’t had to register or disclose ingredients at all.
In 1937, it was completely legal to sell antifreeze-sweetened medicine to children. The only crime the Massengill company could be charged with was misbranding its liquid as an “elixir,, which legally had to contain alcohol, rather than as a “solution,” Blum said. (In fact, this distinction was the only thing that allowed the FDA to get involved and recover the tainted medicine from consumers to begin with.) The sulfanilamide disaster changed everything about consumer safety. Within a year, we had a new Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that, for the first time, gave the FDA the power to demand companies prove a drug was safe before it could be sold.
And that’s effectively the problem we have with e-cigarettes today, Jensen said. The pre-sale approval process exists, but there are thousands of products it doesn’t yet apply to. Meanwhile, it’s legal to sell e-cigarette liquids that contain chemicals we’ve banned as food additives, or that contain chemicals nobody has even thought to list in a database because they form in the package after the ingredients have been mixed together. And while states have begun to ban flavored e-liquids in response to the lung disease outbreak (and the federal government may do the same), that doesn’t solve consumer protection problems that aren’t related to flavoring, such as liquid nicotine that contains far more of the drug than is claimed on the label, or e-cigarette devices manufactured in China that aren’t being held to any kind of safety standards.
But it’s no real surprise we’ve ended up here, said Marian Moser Jones, a public health professor at the University of Maryland. Our laws aimed at stopping products from poisoning people have usually come in reaction to deaths and illness, rather than before.
Ultimately, Moser Jones said, you can look on both historical poisoning cases and the current vaping crisis as a direct result of consumer product safety policy that often favors a right to sell over a right to know that what is being sold is safe. “In other countries there’s less of a question about whether the government has a right to interfere with commerce,” she said. When the careful balance between retailers rights and consumers tips too far to one side, people die.

9th accuser
A woman has come forward with new accusations that former U.S. senator Al Franken groped her butt during an event in 2006 after working the photo line. Eight other women have accused Franken of inappropriate behavior, including three others who also say he grabbed their butts. Franken resigned in 2017, but will soon host a new weekly show on SiriusXM. [The Cut]
92 cents
The average sales price for a dozen eggs from the country’s largest egg producer, Cal-Maine Foods, fell to about 92 cents in the last quarter, 30 percent lower than a year earlier. The company said the drop was due to too many overly productive hens, resulting in an oversupply in the market and reducing its ability to raise prices. [Wall Street Journal]
4 feet of snow
It wasn’t even October before winter fully arrived in Browning, Montana, with 48 inches of snow falling this past weekend, according to the National Weather Service. Strong winds and heavy snowfall created snowdrifts “as high as houses,” as well as downing trees and power lines. The governor’s office said “unseasonably cold temperatures” could delay the thawing of the fluffy white crystals, resulting in the end of growing season for some of the state’s agricultural producers. [National Public Radio]
15 to 20 minutes
Drivers in Auburn Hills, Michigan may have had extra difficulty keeping their eyes on the road this weekend. An electronic billboard at a road junction in town displayed pornographic video late on Saturday night. Shortly after 11 p.m., the Auburn Hills Police Department received calls about the graphic images, and the operating company was contacted to shut the billboard down. Lt. Ryan Gagnon said the videos played for 15 to 20 minutes but no known accidents occurred. [Detroit Free Press]
One-hour volunteer shifts
Concerns over high temperatures during next year’s Summer Olympics in Tokyo have led to government officials restricting volunteer shifts to one-hour intervals. Temperatures in the Japanese capital city regularly exceed 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summer months of July and August. Other cooling measures for spectators and volunteers include rest spaces, neck coolers, paper fans, the distribution of crushed ice, and “umbrella hats.” [Japan Times]
315 billion-tonne iceberg
The third-largest ice shelf in Antarctica just produced its largest iceberg, covering 1,636 square kilometers, in more than 50 years. The iceberg is 210 meters thick, contains 315 billion tonnes of ice and is “a little smaller than Scotland’s Isle of Skye.” A researcher from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography said there was no link between the new iceberg and climate change.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/week-4-taught-us-a-lot-about-backup-qbs-and-nothing-about-defenses/,2019-10-01,,,features,"Sep. 30, 2019",What We Learned From Week 4 Of The NFL,A FiveThirtyEight Chat,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"sara.ziegler (Sara Ziegler, sports editor): Week 4 in this NFL season has been a wild ride. We had Chase Daniel proving his worth as a backup quarterback who’s usually paid not to play, Baker Mayfield getting his revenge on Rex Ryan and Daniel Jones outdueling fellow rookie Dwayne Haskins (after Washington starter Case Keenum was benched).
But let’s start with the weirdest score of the weekend: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 55, Los Angeles Rams 40. What the hell happened here?
neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): That scoreline was a shootout kinda on the order of that epic Rams-Chiefs game from last season. Only trouble is, the Bucs are not the Chiefs, and Jameis Winston is not Patrick Mahomes.
Salfino (Michael Salfino, FiveThirtyEight contributor): I just noticed that Winston was first in Total QBR for the week and Jared Goff was 20th. I actually never thought the game was in doubt until Winston lost his mind and threw one of the worst pick-sixes you can imagine to make it 45-40 (they missed the 2-point conversion) with about eight minutes left.
Goff was all meaningless numbers against the Bucs. It’s good that QBR susses that out.
joshua.hermsmeyer (Josh Hermsmeyer, NFL analyst): These type of point explosions are always in Winston’s range of outcomes. But so are those ridiculous pick-sixes.
Salfino: Exactly. He is so Jekyll & Hyde.
sara.ziegler: I guess my question when I saw the score was: What happened to the Rams defense?
joshua.hermsmeyer: *cracks knuckles*
Well…
Salfino: When you run into a hot QB and an offense that is executing, defense doesn’t really matter. It can’t win.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Defensive statistics — what we traffic in — are largely a function of the offenses you’ve faced, so we often get fooled by those numbers. We assign the numbers to the defense when really it’s just a function — mainly — of the schedule.
Salfino: The Bucs also never took the foot off the gas with their explosive passing plays. The hope for a defense is that the offense gets up big, goes into a conservative shell and loses its mojo if the game turns against them. The Bucs played all day like they needed to score 50.
neil: But isn’t this kind of a counterexample to that theory (that defense is only a function of offenses faced)? Last season, the Rams only gave up more than 32 points twice: Against the Saints and against the Chiefs. Great offenses! It makes sense that it would be a function of schedule. But the Bucs don’t really fit that same profile.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Yeah. I’m not sure too much has changed from last season on offense, where we saw the Bucs putting up huge passing numbers one game and then fading the next. I think the explanation is just that they are very boom-or-bust as a team.
Salfino: The Bucs have talent, though. They’ve been all tools, no toolbox because of Winston’s volatility. But on Sunday, Winston mostly kept his erratic, mistake-prone self in check. If he does that, they are very dangerous. That might be the most talented receiving corps in football if you include the still-ignored-for-some-reason O.J. Howard.
neil: I suppose the Bucs offense did make Ryan Fitzpatrick look like an elite QB for a couple games at the start of last season…
Salfino: Basically, defenses need Winston to beat himself or they’re screwed.
sara.ziegler: Wait, this guy wasn’t elite on his own???

Salfino: I refuse to say anything negative about Fitz.
sara.ziegler: LOL
joshua.hermsmeyer: And yet all the shade for Gardner Minshew last week, smh.
East Coast bias!
Or something
sara.ziegler: I dislike them both!
neil: Haha
Salfino: QBR is throwing shade at Gardner this week.
neil: That’s right Mike — only a 38.8! But if you watched him late in that game, if didn’t seem like a 38.8.
sara.ziegler: He’s 2-1 as a starter.
joshua.hermsmeyer: No, he looked very special late.
Salfino: Yeah, he Tebowed, ironically in Denver.
neil: Lol. Now they know how it FEELS!

joshua.hermsmeyer: I am not.

— Moo (@PFF_Moo) September 30, 2019

My main reason is that in his first game, he performed at a level over what he ever showed in college, and that’s just unprecedented.
Salfino: That’s an excellent stat. Let’s see what he does against the Vikings this week. He’s lucky the game is in East Rutherford.
He’s also lucky he’ll only have to score about 17 points.
(Sorry, Sara.)
sara.ziegler: I think 7 points will probably do it.
neil: I thought Kirk Cousins talk was off-limits in this chat.
Salfino: I was trying to be nice.
Is Cousins still in the league?
joshua.hermsmeyer: You know who was worse than Cousins on early-down passes yesterday?
Tom Brady.
(Cousins yards per dropback: 2.97; TB12: 2)
sara.ziegler: 🤔
neil: I know Buffalo is a legit defense, but that’s a bad game for TB12.
Salfino: With Brady, do we have to be alarmed that he’s showing his age, give credit to the Bills, or just ascribe it to random variance? His raw QBR was 10.3, and it was under 20 even after adjusting.
Brady’s yards per attempt by year from 2016 on: 8.2, 7.9, 7.6 and now … 7.3. I see a pattern!
neil: According to our Elo QB metric, this week was Brady’s worst game (relative to average) since 2013.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Wait, is this the year he’s washed?
Sounds like bulletin board material.
Salfino: Eventually, we’ll all be dead, Josh.
sara.ziegler: Not if we eat enough kale, Mike.
Salfino: Never!
sara.ziegler: Hahaha
Salfino: Brady looked old. Let’s be honest. He is old. Gravity always wins, though he’s defied it for a very long time. Maybe we’ll look back at this as a meaningless blip, too, but I doubt it.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I dunno, something something stem cells. He could play forever.
neil: To be fair, Brady has seemed poised to decline so many times over the years, we’re numb to it by now. The default assumption is that he’ll rebound and be fine.
(He also was fine in the previous three games.)
Salfino: What’s the Occam’s razor takeaway with Brady’s Week 4? (Does Gillette make those?)
sara.ziegler: LOL
neil: I smell a sponsored segment of the weekly chat!
joshua.hermsmeyer: I think Bill Belichick expected a tough rock fight, and it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Much like the Cowboys and the Saints.
Salfino: Was the problem with the Cowboys yesterday too much running on early downs?


Cowboys Pass Rate on 1st/2nd Down:
Week 1 vs NYG: 69%Week 2 @ WAS: 64%Week 3 vs MIA: 53%Week 4 @ NO: 50%

joshua.hermsmeyer: Hard to say what Garrett was thinking. Questioning the fundamentals of *squints* counting appears to be on the table in Dallas.


Jason Garrett on @1053thefan says he doesn’t know that he fully agrees that the Cowboys ran it more on first and second down against New Orleans.
— RJ Ochoa (@rjochoa) September 30, 2019

neil: Credit to the Saints’ defense, though, for the pressure they put on Dak Prescott.
Salfino: Why not open up the offense yesterday and force Teddy Bridgewater, who has no possibility of any explosion in his game, to make plays? The old saw is that you beat the opponent with the passing game and then beat the clock with the running game.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I believe the intent was to establish the run. They ran 20 times — many with the highest-paid back in the NFL — and averaged 2.3 yards per attempt.
neil: Bridgewater had one of the least-deserving QB wins of the season Sunday, I think.
Actually, if you look at worst QB Elo ratings in games the QB still won, Teddy’s game is second so far this season. Brady’s is the worst, LOL.
Salfino: That late sack was sickening. I actually thought Drew Brees was going to vomit.
Sacks that take you out of FG range are turnovers, period.
sara.ziegler: That sack was really something. I believe I yelled at my TV, “THROW IT AWAY, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.”
And I didn’t even have a rooting interest in that game.
neil: Residual Bridgewater rooting via the Vikings.
joshua.hermsmeyer: FWIW, Sean Payton blamed himself for the play call.
Salfino: I don’t care if the pass rush is fired out of a cannon at you, you can’t get sacked there.
sara.ziegler: That would be an interesting new wrinkle for defenses.
neil: 

sara.ziegler: The other weird game yesterday, in my mind, was Lions-Chiefs.
The Lions look … good?
neil: Or, at least, not-bad?
Salfino: My plea to NFL teams is to stop the hurdling and reaching the ball over the goal line. The Patriots have a rule that if you do the latter, you are taken out of the game. And Matt Patricia obviously has a Patriots history. Yet, Kerryon Johnson did it so recklessly on first-and-goal from the 1-yard line, and they lost the game. It was a 14-point swing.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I’m so very glad the refs swallowed the whistle.
Salfino: Yeah, that was a super job by the refs.
joshua.hermsmeyer: But I think the game is just another reminder that we don’t really know who is good on defense yet. Are the Lions really that much better at this than the Ravens?
Salfino: The Ravens defense was just atrocious Sunday, but credit to the Browns offense. Mayfield made fun of Rex Ryan, but he did stop leaking out of the pocket like he’s a runner. He stayed in there by sliding and stepping up, and he made a bevy of downfield plays as a result. I think this was a big moment for him because he recognized a weakness and got out of a slump in a big spot on the road.
sara.ziegler: Rex Ryan, always helping out the young players.
neil: Baker needed that game, too. That season-opening slump had been really tough.
This was much more like the Mayfield we saw late last season.
Salfino: One other thing we should mention is the Bears QB situation. Chase Daniel was very good — third in Total QBR — and Mitch Trubisky is likely out for a while. Are the Bears better off with a QB who is more of a game manager and more capable of executing the easy passes? Or is Trubisky, for all his faults, still clearly better and thus this will hurt the Bears should it extend past their Week 6 bye?
neil: This is why Daniel gets paid the big bucks.
Big backup bucks.
A backup better than your starter is worth his weight in gold.
joshua.hermsmeyer: loool
Salfino: The number of backup QBs is really noteworthy too. It feels like we’re up to 137 teams.
neil: I saw a stat that entering Week 4, 40 QBs have started so far — a Super Bowl-era record through three weeks.
sara.ziegler: So backup QBs are the most important players, the Browns are back, the Lions are decent, we don’t know anything about defenses, and Tom Brady will live forever. Does that sum up Week 4?
joshua.hermsmeyer: Yes, Sara!
neil: It was a weird week. The Dolphins actually led a game at one point.

(The Democratic National Committee announced on Friday that the debate would take place on just one night, even though more than 10 candidates qualified.)
Last Tuesday, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard became the 12th candidate to make the stage when she got her fourth qualifying poll, but chances are she’ll be the last candidate to make the cut, as the next person in line — author and motivational speaker Marianne Williamson — still needs three more qualifying polls.

* For candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight.
To qualify for the fourth debate, a candidate must reach 2 percent in at least four national or early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations and must have at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors in at least 20 states. We rely on self-reported figures from the campaigns for candidates’ fundraising numbers, and we’ve assumed that candidates who have reported having at least 130,000 donors also have at least 400 donors from each of 20 states, though it’s possible that Steyer and Gabbard haven’t hit that mark yet. Neither qualified for the September debate, so we don’t know if the DNC has verified their donor numbers.
Source: POLLS, CAMPAIGNS, MEDIA REPORTS
As a reminder, candidates needed to attract 2 percent support in four qualifying national or early-state polls released between June 28 and Oct. 1, plus collect contributions from 130,000 unique donors (including at least 400 individual donors in at least 20 states).1
Of course, the qualifying criteria for the fifth Democratic debate in November are even stricter. Candidates will need four surveys of 3 percent or more in national or early-state polls and contributions from 165,000 unique donors (including at least 600 individual donors in at least 20 states). There is also an alternate path to meet the polling requirement — candidates who attract 5 percent support in two polls in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina also qualify. And anyone who wants to qualify via the early-state route can count two polls from the same polling organization in the same state. For example, candidates who earned 5 percent support in two CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa surveys could count both polls toward the early-state poll path. Candidates qualifying through the four-poll path could count only one of those Iowa polls — each of their four polls must come from a different pollster or cover a different geography.
And at this stage, it’s unclear whether this early-state polling pathway will help any candidates qualify; the only candidates who’ve earned 5 percent in at least two early-state polls already got at least 3 percent support in four qualifying polls, so they would get in that way as well. In fact, one thing the fifth debate requirements make obvious is that the candidate field is consolidating into three main groups: (1) the five polling front-runners who have easily qualified; (2) a middle tier of seven candidates, most of whom will probably make the debate but who are struggling to hit more than 2 or 3 percent in the polls; and (3) a bottom tier of candidates who have virtually no chance of qualifying.

As you can see, qualifying won’t be easy for that middle tier — but some of those candidates are close, like tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who each need only one more poll, and Sen. Cory Booker, who needs just two more. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke still need three more qualifying surveys, but they’ve probably got a month or more to rack up those polls2 so while their path to the stage looks difficult, it’s not impossible.
What’s more, even though neither Gabbard nor former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro have a qualifying poll yet, they’ve already cleared the donor threshold, which means they’re still in a better position than the six candidates FiveThirtyEight considers “major” who haven’t met the donor requirement or registered a single qualifying poll. Given the long odds that these candidates face, we might expect some more dropouts soon — for instance, Castro recently told supporters in a fundraising email that his campaign would close up shop if he failed to make the November debate. It’s easy to imagine he wouldn’t be the only one.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

While something like Astros-Nationals — which has never happened in the postseason but is our fifth-most likely World Series matchup — might eventually be in store for us, there’s a 77 percent chance that this Fall Classic will give us a playoff rematch of some kind and a 64 percent chance of pairing teams that have faced each other since at least the 1980s. So here’s a breakdown of the past and present for the five most common championship rematches in our model’s simulations:


Houston Astros vs. Los Angeles Dodgers 
19 percent chance of happening
Then: 1981 Division Series, 2017 World Series

Although these teams also played in the 1981 Division Series, the rematch on everyone’s minds came just two years ago — when Houston beat L.A. in a seven-game homerfest that ranks among the most exciting ever (Game 7 notwithstanding). That series was packed with signature moments, highlighted by the seesaw battles Houston won in Games 2 and 5; according to The Baseball Gauge, the Dodgers had a 71 percent chance of winning the World Series as late as the fifth inning of Game 5 and were above 50 percent going into Game 7 at home, but the Astros eventually prevailed to secure the franchise’s first title.
Now: Some of the key characters have changed — Houston now has Gerrit Cole and Yordan Álvarez instead of Dallas Keuchel and Marwin González; L.A. has Max Muncy and vastly improved versions of Cody Bellinger and Walker Buehler but a less effective Clayton Kershaw and no Yasiel Puig. The core of the matchup remains the same, however, and this time these are probably the two best teams in baseball, ranking Nos. 1 and 2 in wins above replacement (WAR),1 compared with Nos. 3 and 4 in 2017. Our model would give the Astros a slight edge to win again in this hypothetical World Series battle of two teams that seem to have been on a collision course all season.


Los Angeles Dodgers vs. New York Yankees
14 percent
Then: 1977, 1978 and 1981 World Series

The Yankees and Dodgers have faced off in 11 total World Series, dating back to the Subway Series days when the Dodgers played in Brooklyn. But the instances most younger fans would know came in the late 1970s and early ’80s, when L.A. played New York three times in a five-year span. Reggie Jackson created the legend of “Mr. October” with his MVP performance (1.792 OPS, 5 HR) in 1977, while Bucky Dent, Ron Guidry and Goose Gossage powered another Yankee win the following year. The Dodgers got one back in the split season of 1981, which was the last true N.Y.-versus-L.A. championship battle for 21 years — until the Sparks beat the Liberty for the 2002 WNBA title.2 Despite having the best records in their respective leagues this decade, the Dodgers and Yankees haven’t met in the World Series since that ’81 clash — but that could change this season.
Now: Alongside Astros-Dodgers, Yankees-Dodgers is the other titanic World Series collision we’ve been anticipating all season long. And it would be every bit as star-studded as its precursor from 38 years ago. Instead of Fernandomania, the current Dodgers have … caught the Bellinger Bug? The Ryu Rage? The Muncy Madness? (Sigh.) New York’s modern analog to Jackson, meanwhile, is a lineup that has twice broken the pre-2018 record for home runs in a single season. Los Angeles has a decided advantage in starting pitching over the Yankee staff, but the pinstriped bullpen corps has been superior this season. And the amount of position-player talent on each side would rank among the best in World Series history. It feels like this showdown has been simmering in the background for three years now, and the possibility of Rob Manfred’s dream pairing of America’s top two media markets may finally come true this season.


Houston Astros vs. Atlanta Braves
8 percent
Then: 1997, 1999, 2001, 2004 and 2005 Division Series

This is no World Series rematch, but the Astros and Braves have plenty of playoff history from Houston’s time in the National League. Over the nine postseasons played from 1997 through 2005, Atlanta and Houston met up five times. At first, the dynastic Braves had the Astros’ number, winning nine of the first 10 matchups across three series, including the sequence above — wherein the Astros had the bases loaded and nobody out, at home, in extra innings, only to not score and eventually lose the second-to-last game ever played at the Astrodome. But after that inauspicious start, Houston’s fortunes eventually changed against the Braves, with the Astros prevailing in 2004 and again in ’05 — en route to the franchise’s long-awaited first World Series appearance.
Now: Houston and Atlanta had a remarkable amount of star power in those late-’90s battles, including Hall of Famers Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Greg Maddux, Chipper Jones, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine. But this year’s crop could eventually rival that group, boasting the likes of Ronald Acuña Jr., Alex Bregman, Justin Verlander, Ozzie Albies, José Altuve, Freddie Freeman, Zack Greinke, Josh Donaldson and Cole. Despite the relative evenness of big-name talent, our model would install the Astros as somewhat substantial favorites in the World Series, and with good cause — the only area of the game in which Atlanta didn’t run relatively far behind Houston in WAR this season was base-running. Still, this is the strongest Atlanta has been (according to Elo) going into the playoffs since, ironically enough, the 2004 team that lost to Houston in the NLDS.


Houston Astros vs. St. Louis Cardinals
7 percent
Then: 2004 and 2005 NL Championship Series.

Think back to a time before the Astros changed leagues, switched back to their original logo, pioneered NBA-esque tanking and became perennial championship contenders. Back when Houston’s outfits looked like this and the team was in the NL Central, its rivalry with the Cardinals was always one of baseball’s premier division skirmishes. St. Louis got the better of Houston in the seventh game of the 2004 NLCS — thanks to the Scott Rolen home run above — before the Astros returned the favor with an NLCS win of their own in 2005. Although the AL champ beat the winner in the World Series both years, the road to the NL pennant still went through St. Louis and Houston. It was the best both clubs had been at the same time in their shared history … until now.
Now: It’s been a while since the Cards and Astros were meaningful on-field rivals; their most memorable clash this decade came away from the diamond, when St. Louis hacked into Houston’s information network using Astros GM Jeff Luhnow’s old passwords. But the baseball part of the rivalry could be reignited quickly, too, if the teams end up in the World Series. Houston’s current squad is more talented than its mid-2000s counterparts, though the same might not be said about the 2019 Cardinals: St. Louis ranks 13th in WAR this year, compared with No. 2 in both 2004 and 2005. The current team doesn’t quite have stars on the same order as Rolen, Albert Pujols and Jim Edmonds, though it does have plenty of depth. And it should definitely be noted that the Cardinals have a long history of winning championships despite looking less-than-stellar on paper.


New York Yankees vs. Atlanta Braves
6 percent
Then: 1996 and 1999 World Series.

After the Braves made the World Series in 1991 and 1992, then won it in 1995 and returned again in 1996, the question of which team owned the 1990s seemed open-and-shut. The Braves especially appeared to be in command once the 1996 Series began against the Yankees, with Atlanta taking the first two games on the road and grabbing a 6-0 lead in Game 4, up 2-1 in the series. The Baseball Gauge estimates that Atlanta had an 86 percent chance of winning the World Series at that point, but everything unraveled for the Braves from there — exemplified by Jim Leyritz’s huge home run off fireballing closer Mark Wohlers (see above). The Yankees eventually won in six, took another title over San Diego in 1998 and thoroughly outclassed Atlanta in the 1999 rematch, sweeping the Braves and stealing away key ammunition in the Team of the ’90s argument.
Now: Perhaps surprisingly, given their success by century’s end, neither the Braves nor Yankees have dominated the new millennium. New York has won only a single World Series since 2000, appearing only three times, while Atlanta hasn’t been back to the Fall Classic since that 1999 defeat. But as we noted above, the Braves have rebuilt some of the star power of their ’90s heyday. The Yankees are rounding into roughly the same situation, between their once-injured headliners back at full strength (Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Didi Gregorius) and those who stepped up to carry the team most of this season (DJ LeMahieu, Gleyber Torres). Our Elo model would consider the Yankees only marginally smaller favorites over Atlanta than Houston would be, but perhaps these Braves can finally turn the tables after the letdown of 1996.


Other fun potential rematches:
Cardinals-Yankees (5 percent) — 1964 World Series: MVP Bob Gibson outdueled the favored Yankees in Game 7.
Dodgers-Twins (5 percent) — 1965 World Series: Sandy Koufax (0.38 series ERA) painted his masterpiece in a Game 7 shutout.
Dodgers-A’s (4 percent) — 1988 World Series: Kirk Gibson set the tone for L.A. victory with his Game 1 blast off Dennis Eckersley.
Twins-Braves (2 percent) — 1991 World Series: Minnesota prevailed in one of history’s best Fall Classics.
Twins-Cardinals (2 percent) — 1987 World Series: The Twins used their home-field advantage, outlasting St. Louis to overcome a 3-2 deficit.
Braves-A’s (2 percent) — 1914 World Series: The “Miracle Braves” stormed back from last place at midseason to sweep Philadelphia for the title.
Yankees-Brewers (1 percent) — 1981 ALDS: Back when the Crew were in the AL, Gossage, Dave Righetti and the Yankees survived Milwaukee over a full five games.
Cardinals-A’s (1 percent) — 1931 World Series: In a rematch of the 1930 Series, Cards ace Bill Hallahan and center fielder Pepper Martin helped beat Philly in seven games.

The East, on the other hand, is widely perceived to be a two-team race between the Bucks and the 76ers. For a club like the Brooklyn Nets, that’s more than OK this season.
Yes, the Nets landed two star talents, but with Kevin Durant on the mend after his Achilles rupture during the NBA Finals, the club will welcome with open arms any accomplishments beyond its playoff berth this past campaign — especially since Brooklyn, in the eighth spot in our East projections, may not be a shoo-in for the playoffs.
So what’s ultimately worth watching in this year of transition for the Nets? And is there anything the club could do that would be cause for concern? We lay out three questions that figure to swing the balance for the Nets in either direction.
Can all the Brooklyn ball-handlers get theirs?
The New York Knicks haven’t been shy about signing a plethora of bigs — they’ve been doing that for a long time, and they did it again this summer. The Nets, by contrast, have gone all-in on prioritizing ball-handling. Even before Kyrie Irving was in the picture, they had another All-Star, in D’Angelo Russell, to play alongside Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert. As such, they should once again have multiple guards who are capable of scoring at just about any time — particularly against benches that might not be as strong defensively. The concern, like it was with Russell at times, is whether one or two of the three ball-handlers will stand to suffer as they get used to playing together.
The team’s late-game possessions will be worth watching. Russell had a usage rate of more than 30 percent in fourth quarters last season, while Dinwiddie and LeVert were at 26 and 24 percent, respectively. By contrast, Irving enjoyed a fourth-quarter usage of nearly 34 percent in Boston in 2018-19, while Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum both clocked in at less than 21 percent and Al Horford at 17 percent. (Whatever the breakdown, it’s worth noting that Irving and the Celtics had the best clutch offense in the NBA last year, and it wasn’t even close.)
The trio will undoubtedly feature some redundancies, but Durant’s absence figures to give them a crash course in playing together. And if Dinwiddie and LeVert continue to ascend, the Nets could always use one of them as a trade chip to fortify the rest of the roster around Durant and Irving. That’s looking way down the line. But any way you slice it, these problems of sharing the wealth — if you can even call them that — are ultimately good ones to have.
What version of DeAndre Jordan is Brooklyn getting?
Jordan’s contributions the next few seasons will likely end up being a bellwether of success in Brooklyn, for better or worse.
The 31-year-old, in the first season of a four-year contract, again put up good advanced metrics this past season, holding shooters more than 6 percentage points beneath their average around the rim while also leading the NBA in defensive-rebound percentage1 for a second consecutive season.
Look closer, though — using both film and some of those same advanced metrics — and you’ll realize that Jordan’s numbers ring a bit hollow. Yes, he’s great at rebounding on the defensive end, but some of that stems from how tethered to the basket he can be. Similarly, because he occasionally plays like he has cement blocks tied to his feet, he sometimes doesn’t make any effort whatsoever to contest near the rim, even when he is clearly the player in line to rotate to the ball. (He contested just four shots a game at the rim in 2018-19, a low number for centers2 — and barely more than his backup, Maxi Kleber, who played five fewer minutes per game than Jordan did.) In his “10 Things” column, my ESPN colleague Zach Lowe noted just how awful Jordan’s defensive effort became at times prior to his trade from Dallas to the Knicks.
The Nets will desperately need Jordan to be active on that end, both to cover up for what could be an underwhelming defensive unit and also to give Brooklyn what it didn’t have last year against Philadelphia and Joel Embiid: a center who actually has the size to defend in the post without fouling left and right. Jarrett Allen, who’s just 21 years old, may still hold onto the starting spot, but last season showed that he’s still a bit young and woefully undersized for certain matchups.
If Jordan can be a good screen-setter for Irving and dive hard to the basket each night, he’ll force defenses to collapse down into the paint, which, when paired with perimeter threats like Irving and league-best marksman Joe Harris, should open up the team’s spacing considerably more.
But if there’s one place Jordan can be influential from the jump, it’s on the defensive end, where the Nets finished in the middle of the pack last year and risk sliding even further this year without DeMarre Carroll, Jared Dudley and Ed Davis (and presumably Durant, who could have helped fill some of those voids).
Is there enough frontcourt scoring without Durant?
Going back to his stints as an assistant coach with the Knicks and Atlanta Hawks, Kenny Atkinson’s offenses have been known for running pick-and-rolls more than just about anyone, something that figures to give Jordan a chance to score. But if the center can’t reprise Lob City in Brooklyn, where can the Nets expect to find scoring, outside of their three-headed monster of Irving, Dinwiddie and LeVert?
Taurean Prince, whom the Nets got from Atlanta in exchange for the No. 17 pick and Allen Crabbe (a deal largely constructed to help Brooklyn open a second maximum salary slot in free agency), can help with some of the scoring that a healthy Durant would have provided. Offensively, Prince represents a younger, steadier shooting version of Carroll, having hit 38 percent for his career from 3-point range and better than 42 percent of his tries from the corner. And aside from his spot-up looks, Prince will occasionally take a dribble hand-off and create out of it, either for himself or to set up a teammate.
Beyond him, though, it’s anyone’s guess as to what sort of production Brooklyn can expect out of their forwards and centers, other than screens and occasional rebounds. Allen and Jordan can score if and when they get the ball at point-blank range, but are otherwise offensively limited. Rodions Kurucs was a starter for much of his rookie season last year but is still dealing with the fallout stemming from his domestic-violence arrest a month ago. Wilson Chandler was hit with a 25-game suspension after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs, and then there’s Garrett Temple, who has garnered a reputation as a solid NBA veteran in recent years but shot below league average from the 3-point stripe last season after shooting closer to 40 percent the season before.
At some point in the next 18 months, the Nets will likely no longer have to address questions related to their scoring. A simple Irving-Durant pick-and-roll or pick-and-pop3 will unlock an array of options within their offense. But before then — when they figure to know their roster’s strengths, how certain players mesh and how defenses will play them in turn — it will be fascinating to see what Brooklyn can accomplish with one MVP-caliber shooting arm tied behind its back.

A couple of months ago, I found myself in the curious position of examining Joe Biden’s head.
On television, the former vice president comes across as perpetually tanned and coiffed — always with the aviator glasses and the crisp shirtsleeves. He still works out every morning, often lifting weights and riding a Peloton bike, and his face is still golden, his brow remarkably unfurrowed for a man of his 76 years. Up close — like, six inches up close — Biden is slighter than you might imagine. From my aft position in a press gaggle in Dearborn, Michigan, I could see the baby-pink of his scalp peeking through wisps of gleaming white hair and the faint mottling near his ears. They caught me off guard, all those fragile little human details you miss on television.
And it was a very human summer for Biden, if you’re going by “to err is human” standards. On June 18, speaking at a New York City fundraiser at the Carlyle Hotel (a swank spot on the Upper East Side where Woody Allen has a standing gig to play jazz clarinet), Biden began talking about the need for consensus-building. According to the pool report, he broke into a southern drawl as he brought up a segregationist senator from Mississippi: “I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland,” Biden said. “He never called me ‘boy,’ he always called me ‘son.’” Herman Talmadge — “one of the meanest guys I ever knew” — was another southern segregationist Democrat who Biden worked with. “Well guess what? At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished.”
The outrage was swift. The following day, fellow White House hopeful Sen. Cory Booker put out a statement. “You don’t joke about calling black men ‘boys,’” it began, adding, “He is wrong for using his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of how to bring our country together.” Biden responded by saying Booker should apologize. “There’s not a racist bone in my body,” he said. “I’ve been involved in civil rights my whole career.”
So a month later, when a reporter in the sweaty Dearborn gaggle started by asking what Biden made of Booker calling him “the architect of mass incarceration” — a reference to his involvement with the passage of the 1994 crime bill — Biden let out a little gust of a sigh before answering. “Cory knows that’s not true.” He seemed weary of the question, and aware that it wasn’t going away.


Biden has largely led in the polls since entering the Democratic primary. Yet his front-runner status is complex: a cornerstone of his primary support is the black community — a recent poll from YouGov and The Economist showed Biden with as much as 65 percent of black support — even as his decades-long record on racial issues has transmuted into something deeply troubling to some Democratic voters. Though Sen. Elizabeth Warren has nipped at his heels in recent polls, Biden remains a peculiar front-runner — numerically indisputable yet, perhaps, fatally flawed.
Biden has a number of swirling factors to thank for his strength with black Democrats. He was President Obama’s vice president and has staked out a spot in the primary’s relatively uncrowded moderate lane — one that ideologically suits many black voters just fine. He’s also hit on a lurking note of pessimism among some black voters about what sort of person they think might be “electable” in a country that made Donald Trump president after the first black man had the job. Biden’s general election proposition, after all, involves winning over white Trump voters who some Democrats have spent the past three years accusing of racism and xenophobia. 
Something about the man himself seems to be resonating with black voters, too. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a Democratic power broker, told me that Biden’s greatest asset with black voters might well be his own life story, which is strewn with personal tragedy. “We can be no more noble than what our experiences allow us to be. And black voters, by and large, see so much of their experiences in Joe Biden.”
The cornerstone of Biden’s candidacy is support from the black community and his long-standing relationships in it. In June, he attended Rep. James Clyburn’s “World Famous Fish Fry” and spoke to Rev. Al Sharpton.									WIN MCNAMEE / SEAN RAYFORD / GETTY IMAGESBut while Joseph Robinette Biden, the Irish-American speaker of self-conscious Scrantonese, is black voters’ current choice in a Democratic primary featuring two viable black candidates, there’s a sense that the winds could shift at any moment. He spent the better part of the summer relitigating his decades-long voting record. His opponents have pressed him on what they say is an antiquated outlook on race relations in America, all in an effort to chip away at his support among people of color. Prominent Democrats openly fret that he might be too old for the job. The supposed ephemera has accumulated against him even as the numbers check out nicely on paper.
The oddity for present-day Joe Biden is that he was sure America already knew him and what he was all about. But the politics of 2019’s Democratic Party can be slipshod and capricious. Its candidates are viewed more often than not through a kaleidoscopic refraction of peoples’ frustrations with the system or their anger at the president. Biden isn’t really “Uncle Joe” these days, but he presents a pretty enough picture; squint and you’ll see the halcyon Democratic era of the Obamas. If things stay that way — for black voters most especially — Biden might yet win a presidential nomination. But one or two ticks off the mark and the colors and patterns all change. Suddenly Biden could look like a wholly different man.


Biden’s current resonance with black voters is perhaps chiefly owed to Obama, a man he once called “the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.”
In one sense it’s ironic that Biden’s Achilles heel is the past, since a central argument of his campaign is that he can turn back the clock — but not too far back. He wants voters to remember him from the placid (by comparison) days of the Obama administration. Further back in Biden’s past, things get iffier. To that end, it is Obama’s name that Biden seems to mention most on the campaign trail — so much so that at the recent NAACP national convention, moderator April Ryan asked Biden if he used the former president as a “crutch.” (The answer was no. He then went on to talk about Obama some more.) Obama, it should be noted, is wildly popular among Democrats these days — a Gallup post-presidency poll found that he had a 95 percent favorability rating.
The continued Obama name-dropping might have seemed cringeworthy following Biden’s opponents’ critiques — verging on an I-have-black-friends line of defense — but it was also powerful. Many black voters buy the idea that if Biden was good enough for Obama, Biden’s good enough for them. Sheila Hill, an NAACP convention attendee from Arlington, Texas, was emblematic of many voters when she put her fondness of Biden in familial terms: “Joe came up like he’s a member of the family, like he might sit down and have a bite to eat, pull him up a plate, let him get some greens and cornbread. And you know how everyone was introduced? He didn’t need to introduce himself because he’s part of the family.” 
A lynchpin of the Biden campaign’s strategy is embracing President Obama’s legacy whenever possible.									SAUL LOEB / AFP / GETTY IMAGESA couple of days later, in the midst of the Booker vs. Biden news cycle, I was sitting in the Indianapolis Airport when I spotted Rev. Al Sharpton across the terminal. I was coming home from the National Urban League Conference, where I had squished myself into an uncomfortable chair to watch the crowd titter as Rep. Tim Ryan walked on stage to Johnny Cash. I had spent the morning with one ear on the speeches and one eye on Twitter, where Biden acolytes were touting a general election head-to-head poll that put him several points up on Trump in Ohio, the only Democrat ahead of the president. Sharpton had been there too, addressing the assembled members of the civil rights group.
 “I think that he certainly enjoys a lot from the Obama connection,” Sharpton said, wearing a beautifully tailored suit and reclining in his seat just in front of the gate. “That’s what I think Biden’s hidden advantage is, deservedly or not: he gets associated credit for Obama dealing with Trayvon [Martin] and Obama dealing with policing commissions.”
(Despite numerous requests for this story on black voters, the campaign did not make Biden available for an interview with FiveThirtyEight.)
Sharpton, for one, seemed unsurprised by Biden’s lead over Sens. Kamala Harris and Booker. “You can’t now take the black vote for granted, and Joe has relationships,” he said. “And they’re long-standing relationships. You need a Jim Clyburn in South Carolina, I don’t care who you are.” By his estimation, Harris and Booker still had a chance to win over black voters, but their paths were far from assured. “I think that racial politics has changed — not dramatically, but to some degree — post-Obama because the novelty is no longer there.”
Sharpton, who expertly fielded the handshakes of a stream of strangers as we spoke, has himself entertained white candidates like Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg at Sylvia’s soul food restaurant in Harlem. He was judging the 2020 Democrats, he told me, on the strength of their platforms. For what it was worth, he liked Buttigieg’s Douglass Plan, a framework to solve fiscal and societal inequities that affect the black community.
The quiet stirring of businessmen near the gate told me it would soon be boarding time. I asked Sharpton how much time Harris and Booker had until it was too late. The end of September, he answered. “Unless of course, Joe does something absolutely off the wall,” he said, chuckling. “Which is not beyond the possible — we are talking about Joe.”


Biden has caught heat from activists for unpopular policies of the Obama administration, like deportations.									BASTIAAN SLABBERS / NURPHOTO VIA GETTY IMAGESThere’s a bookstore near my office that I sometimes browse on my lunch hour, a happy way to avoid the harsh fluorescence of office life. Over the summer, a book caught my eye: “Hope Rides Again: An Obama Biden Mystery.” The cover featured a cartoon Obama dangling from the end of a rope ladder — which itself was dangling from an airborne helicopter — while grasping for Biden, trying to pull him up. A few shelves away was the title, “Hugs from Obama: A Photographic Look Back at the Warmth and Wisdom of President Barack Obama.” While bookstores on Manhattan’s Upper West Side cater to a specific subset of America, the books’ mere existence tells a person something: a lot of Democrats still really like Barack Obama and his moderate-in-2019 policies. That’s why the lynchpin of the Biden strategy is embracing the former president’s legacy and coalition whenever possible.
Sometimes, though, that strategy can catch Biden heat. At the second Democratic debate at the end of July, he said that illegal immigrants should “get in line” and wait to enter the country legally. Julián Castro, Obama’s former Housing and Urban Development Secretary, skewered the administration’s deportation policy. “It looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn’t,” Castro told Biden in a heated exchange.
Biden faced fallout from this exchange. Activists said that he had been echoing conservative talking points, so he met with Latino leaders in person to smooth things over.
“To me that was surprising because I had written that line for Barack Obama multiple times in every immigration speech we ever did,” former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau told me. “Even language that was, in the Obama years, approved and fine and culturally sensitive — it’s suddenly not.” (A former senior Obama White House advisor said of the debate, “On the Obama side we’re not defensive. The party and the country are in different places than we were in 2008. It would be silly to run on the exact same policies and ideas that we implemented.”) 
That’s in part because of the conversation happening online. A favorite line of the Biden campaign is that Twitter isn’t real life, a nod to the fact that young, progressive, vociferously anti-Biden voices seem most amplified on the social networking site but are less representative of the broader base of the party. “We’re not going to let Twitter dictate this primary process for us,” said Symone Sanders, a senior advisor to the Biden campaign. “If we did, frankly, I think we’d spend all our time talking about 1994,” a reference to the 1994 crime bill, Biden’s support of which has helped label him as almost-Republican in certain circles.
The campaign operation has been focused instead on messaging Biden’s moderation and his close ties to Obama. On the morning of the third debate in mid-September, the campaign tweeted out a video with the caption, “Barack Obama was a great president. We don’t say that enough.” Greg Schultz, Biden’s campaign manager, wrote, “Barely a week goes by where some Democratic presidential candidate doesn’t directly or indirectly criticize Pres. Obama. The attacks are out of touch with the majority view of the Democratic Party voters.”
In order to win the nomination in a crowded race, Biden needs to cultivate support across demographic groups, to at least feint at his ability to win back the Obama coalition in the general election. His bedrock of support is black voters. Black voters made up around one-quarter of the 2016 Democratic primary electorate and are a crucial demographic group for any candidate. According to Gallup, 63 percent of non-Hispanic black Democratic voters self-identify as moderate or conservative. This, even as the Democratic Party overall has gotten more liberal — 2018 was the first year that over half of Democrats (51 percent) identified as liberal (in 1994, that number was only 25 percent.)
But while black voters have remained more moderate or conservative, white voters have become increasingly likely to identify as liberal — 65 percent of non-Hispanic white Democrats called themselves liberal and have become rapidly more liberal on issues of race over the past 10 years. With white liberals comprising a key demographic not just in the first two primary states, Iowa and New Hampshire, but also in the media, it’s no wonder that Biden’s campaign has felt the pile-on of Twitter chatter.
Yet Biden has given his progressive critics ample opportunity to say he’s carelessly retrograde when he talks about race. In early August, for example, he said “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.” While he immediately tried to correct himself, Biden has a long-time reputation for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. Favreau told me there was “an anxiety that lasted throughout the White House [years] — ‘will Biden say something sort of off?’ Biden’s reputation before he became vice president wasn’t ‘middle-class Uncle Joe’ and it also wasn’t too old and out of touch — it was that he was a blowhard,” he said.


While a summer of attacks hasn’t shaken Biden’s black support overall, younger black voters don’t seem to like what they see as much as older black voters. CNN polling analysis from this summer showed that Biden’s overall support from black voters is 44 percent, but his support with black Americans under the age of 50 is lower, at 36 percent. CNN modeling suggested that his support is likely less than 30 percent among black voters under the age of 30. A recent poll suggested that Warren might be making inroads with black voters. She has also gained overall on Biden in key states like Iowa and in some national polls.
Younger voters, black ones included, are concerned about issues of race and justice — things like fixing the school-to prison-pipeline, lowering incarceration rates for black men and curbing police violence. Which is why Biden’s vote on the 1994 crime bill has become such a problem and a fixation for the campaign. It might be that younger voters, who previously only knew Biden as the friendly older man next to Obama, are perturbed when they see the crime bill through 2019 eyes: mandatory life sentences after “three strikes” for federal crimes and incentivizing states to pursue harsher sentencing.
Biden, January 1990									LAURA PATTERSON / CQ ROLL CALL VIA GETTY IMAGESObama has reportedly expressed worry that Biden World advisors are too old school for the candidate’s good. Some of his advisors, like Sen. Ted Kaufman and Mike Donilon, have been with Biden for decades.
But younger advisors have come on board, too — Schultz and his deputy, Kate Bedingfield, are of a newer generation — and Sanders, a high-profile hire who served on Sen. Bernie Sanders’s 2016 campaign, is 29 years old. I asked Sanders, who is black, what if any advice she had given to Biden about talking to younger black voters. “I’m not going to divulge the particulars of the conversations that I have with Vice President Biden, but what I’ll say is that he and I have a good rapport, we have a good relationship and the nature of our relationship is that Joe Biden is a frank guy, he’s authentic and he speaks his mind and he empowers the people around him to do the same.”
The polls, Sanders said, bore out that Biden’s approach was working. “Anyone who purports that we don’t understand this moment or our campaign doesn’t get it — I think we uniquely understand this moment because this has been our argument from day one.”
But the crime bill remains a vulnerability for the campaign, something that engenders defensiveness from the candidate. In June, while answering a question about prison reform he brought up the crime bill, “which you’ve been conditioned to say is a bad bill,” he told the audience.
Biden has spent a lot of time in a defensive crouch about the legislation. His proposed criminal justice reform plan outlines ways to reduce incarceration, a pointed policy rebuke to the effects of the 1994 bill. But at events, he goes to lengths to defend what he calls the good parts of the bill — including the Violence Against Women Act — and his surrogates are quick to say that people are purposefully leaving out the historical context of what America was like when the legislation was passed. Clyburn — who has not yet endorsed a candidate — recalled for me a town hall meeting he had back in the 1990s in a mostly black town in South Carolina. “I spoke out against mandatory minimums, I spoke out against the crack cocaine policy. I almost got physically attacked in that place. There wasn’t a white person in the room,” he said. “To them, crack cocaine was a scourge in the African American community and they supported this crackdown.”
Biden’s grappling with his pre-Obama history is fraught, in part, because before being Obama’s vice president, he wasn’t much of a known figure in black communities. When Biden briefly ran for president in the 1988 election — a June to September endeavor that ended in a plagiarism scandal — he had little apparent appeal in the black community. A pre-scandal poll from that summer shows that he didn’t even register with black voters — he was at 0 percent while Jesse Jackson, one of the first major black Democratic candidates, had 48 percent of the black vote.
Still, hopes for Biden were high, particularly in the political media. One Los Angeles Times story from that June called Biden “the white Jesse Jackson” and noted that his opposition to federally mandated busing was savvy, “a sign of both his keen political instinct and a social imagination — a sense of the real-life consequences of government action that is rare in Washington.” Biden opposed busing because it threatened to destroy “the consensus on civil rights within the white middle class that permitted progress’ for blacks,” the story surmised. Even on hot-button issues like race, Biden was proud of his ability to foster compromise and centrism. It’s a legacy that hasn’t aged as well in a Democratic Party which is more apt to burn its one-time idols than study their historiography.


The day after the second debate, Jonathan Kinloch, a black Democratic Party official in Detroit, sat with me at a local cafe eating forkfuls of something sweet while saying something bitter: “Based on where we’ve come over these past three years and looking at the person, that Tasmanian Devil in the White House, it’s going to take another same sort of type of white man to go toe-to-toe with him.”
Kinloch doesn’t think America is going to elect a black candidate, not right now. “I’ve come to only one conclusion: Trump was elected out of eight years of repudiation for having a black man in the office. I think right now, where this country is, the flames that have been fanned by Donald Trump, we have to take a measured approach to this upcoming election.” 
Biden faced blowback in July’s Democratic primary debate for his comments about fostering compromise with segregationist senators and for his stance on federally mandated busing.									BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / AFP / GETTY IMAGESThis is the sort of electability argument that the Biden campaign can’t quite say out loud, but to which some black voters seem at least partially resigned. They might not love Biden’s semi-frequent verbal washouts but Trump in the White House grates on them more. It’s this logic, as bright and shining as their candidate’s teeth, that Biden allies allude to. Whatever his sins, whatever his prior stances, Biden’s 2020 intentions are pure — certainly purer than Trump’s. And, the theory goes, he’s got the sort of mass appeal that will talk sense into Obama voters who defected to Trump the last go-round. (Recently, a whistleblower complaint surfaced claiming that Trump leaned on the Ukrainian president to find damaging information on Biden and his son Hunter. In response to the news, Biden said that Trump was going to such extremes only because “he knows I’ll beat him like a drum.”)
There’s a risk, of course, that in trying to appeal to everyone, in refusing to play too woke, Biden risks flagging enthusiasm from black voters come the general election. The black vote disastrously didn’t surface for Hillary Clinton in 2016. There’s also some serious doubt that any candidate besides the singular first black president could inspire high turnout in the black community. In a Detroit press gaggle, I asked Biden how he planned to get Obama-era levels of votes in the black community in key general election states. I got a typically-rambling response in return. “They want to know someone — first of all, are they telling them the truth, are they laying out straight exactly what they’re going to do? No double talk. What are you going to do. And then secondly, ‘Do I believe you understand me? Do I believe you know my heart?’ I’m not a black man, to state the obvious, but I’ve gone out of my way to understand the best I possibly can what the concerns are.”
Some of the weirdness of the 2020 primary, including Biden’s leading it, is that for a party professing to be fighting for the soul of America — like, for real for real this time — there isn’t much soaring idealism afoot. It’s a contest about pragmatism. As Jill Biden put it, “You may like another candidate better but you have to look at who’s going to win … Joe is that person.”
“People are not excited, they’re not inspired,” said Anton Gunn, Obama’s former South Carolina political director. “Young people want to be inspired, everyone wants to be inspired. I don’t think we have a sense from anyone in the field that’s inspiring.”
When I spoke with Jackson, I asked what he thought about black voters’ support for Biden, his old rival. “The absence of Trump is not the presence of justice,” he said. “In the days to come I’m sure those who put forth the most hope for tomorrow and plans will gain the most traction in time. That may be Biden, but the question is wide open.”
The morning of the second debate, I met Rep. Cedric Richmond, the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and a co-chair of the Biden campaign, in the lounge of a downtown Detroit hotel. Various suits wandered the halls and a forlorn offering of pasta salad stood sentinel in one corner. I asked Richmond about the same thing I asked Sanders: had the campaign done any additional preparation with the candidate to ready for a new racial discourse?
“I didn’t know we had a new language on race,” Richmond answered wryly. Millennials, he went on, “are the beneficiaries of things that they don’t know they’re beneficiaries of — for example, murder was at an all time high in the early ‘90s. The streets were violent. You had children, mothers, fathers, brothers, sons being killed in the streets, you had rampant carjackings, you had drug dealing everywhere. The African American community was up in arms asking people to do stuff.”
For black voters, Richmond said, the stakes of the 2020 election were clear: “Donald Trump could be a one man end of Reconstruction.” Beating him is what matters. Dwelling on Biden’s vocabulary is just frippery by comparison.


Biden supporters cheer during the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention in June. South Carolina, with its predominantly black electorate, is crucial to Biden’s success in the primary.									LEAH MILLIS / REUTERSRichmond told me the campaign sees a path to victory through the South, a region packed with black votes. Dave Wasserman, editor at The Cook Political Report, agreed. “I think his strengths lie on Super Tuesday,” he said of the slate of March 3 primaries a month after the very first contest in Iowa. Candidates like Warren are more likely to do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, Wasserman said. Biden campaign officials have told reporters they don’t think he needs to win Iowa, where liberal white activist voters hold sway. “But when you’re talking about a massive one-day clearance sale on Super Tuesday where it’s all about mass appeal and name recognition and strength — particularly black voters in the south, that’s where Biden really needs to hold on,” Wasserman said.  
South Carolina’s Feb. 29 primary is a bellwether for Biden’s Southern strategy with a primary electorate that’s almost two-thirds black. Biden was at 43 percent in a recent CBS News/YouGov poll of the state, and it is a must-win for him. But strategists there hardly seem to think that things are sewn up for Biden. “I don’t believe polls because the same polls at this time in 2007 would show Obama was losing to Hillary Clinton by 18 points,” Gunn said. Obama would go on to win South Carolina. ”We kept organizing. Organizing is about touching people and knowing how many voters you’ve identified.” Booker’s field organization looked pretty good to Gunn, though he said it wasn’t as robust as Obama’s had been in the 2008 primary. “Definitely don’t write off Booker,” said a senior South Carolina Democrat who asked for anonymity to more freely discuss the campaign. “He has the best operation.”
I headed to South Carolina in late August, just as my inbox was signaling crunchtime of the presidential campaign slog: Buttigieg in L.A., Warren in Washington state, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and Biden in South Carolina.
As a rule, Biden campaign events — which take place less often than other 2020 candidates’ — tend to be large affairs. His late August town hall in Spartanburg was no exception. Massive rollup American flag displays were stretched taut at either end of an echoing room. The campaign’s “Biden President” logo was slapped up everywhere. The omission of the word “for” was a not-so-subliminal message about the job he wants. A large contingent of media typed in back; a brawny blonde reporter joked with a brawny salt-and-pepper reporter about some home state sports thing.
Basically every Biden event — every 2020 campaign event for that matter — is a chance for a secular revival. And Biden is good at being churchy; he knows what to give a crowd. He can be folksy and familiar — the ghost of Uncle Joe — as well as discursive on issues of morality. When talking about guns or abortion he is most eloquent; you get the sense that Biden has devoted a whole lot of time inside his head to those topics. He starts every town hall or speech by setting the stakes with a mention of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017: “It shocked the whole world.”
Biden’s speech is riddled with “I’m being serious” and “seriously, folks” and “no kidding, folks,” to the point where it’s become a running joke in the press corps. I spoke with a former speechwriter of his who thinks that the “folks” tics might be something Biden has developed over time to deal with the stutter he had in childhood. “It’s how he handles transitions,” he told me.
Biden has struggled to gain ground with younger voters despite his strong showing in the polls overall.									SEAN RAYFORD / GETTY IMAGESThe childhood stutter is one of many personal details that voters have learned about Biden over the years — people have a relationship with him. Those I spoke with who know Biden all tended to say the same thing: he actually is an earnest guy. The care is real. But there’s also a carefully refined rubric of folksiness at work, all mixed with a 76-year-old’s out-of-date sensibilities. Those things can rub some people the wrong way, but both might be political strengths in the general election. “Above all else, it’s just human, it’s a storytelling voice,” Biden’s former speechwriter told me about the candidate’s preferred public voice. “It actively tries to connect with the people who are literally in front of him. Not with some kind of abstract, ethereal voter demographic or anything like that. It’s personal.” In Spartanburg, for instance, Biden talked about women deserving equal pay, but framed the problem through the lens of blue-collar men wanting their wives to be paid more. It wasn’t exactly a politically correct formulation of the issue, but its practicality rang true.
There is a gentle affect about Biden, too. When telling stories about his adult children, he refers to them as “honey” — the doting dad. Stories about his parents start with “Joey …” and suddenly he’s the adoring son. He apologizes for blocking the sign language interpreter. When he shakes hands with people, he stares deeply into their eyes — the kind of eye contact that some have called creepy but others find intoxicating coming from a very famous person. Biden has an ability to make people feel as if he has really listened. One voter I talked to in Spartanburg, Vanessa Logan, emailed me later to say that she’d asked Biden a detailed question; he had made sure his aides got her contact info so they could send her his book for a more in-depth explanation.
This attentiveness coupled with the routine vulnerability Biden shows is partially why people can’t help but be a little fond of him. “He’s down to earth, has a lot of warmth,” Sheran Littlejohn, a middle-aged black voter who came out to see Biden during his South Carolina swing, told me. “At first I thought about Kamala Harris, but then she started coming down on her own party. She went after Biden.” Somehow, even as Biden is running to protect America from Trump, he’s made voters feel like they want to protect him. 


A few hours after the Spartanburg event I was at Limestone College in Gaffney, South Carolina, where it was sweltering hot even a little after 5 p.m. The only breeze came from the pep band flag twirlers entertaining a waiting crowd and the ladies in it who sat fanning themselves. Biden was running late, so I dipped into the library for a few minutes of A/C, then strolled through the crowd. I found Rosa Webber, 64, under the shade of a Magnolia tree, waiting for the event to begin with her friends from the Gaffney Women’s Democratic Club.
Webber had already made up her mind about who she’ll be voting for, come February’s primary. “If he was good enough for Obama, he’s good enough to be my president,” she said of Biden. But Anita Chambers was still candidate shopping. She liked Biden and Harris, but, “also, what’s her name? Elizabeth Warren. I like her. She’s very outspoken, very direct.”
Webber didn’t think any of the women could win, though. I asked why and before she could answer, Annette Byers, 75, interrupted: “Because the men, they’re going to do females just the way they did Hillary.” Webber agreed. “Yeah, the men are not going to vote for women. I don’t think it’s time for the women to step up.” Chambers tried to say something positive about the promise of a reinvigorated women’s movement. Byers wasn’t moved. “They will cheat her out of the election just like they did with Hillary. They will lie, lie, lie.” The conversation ended soon after, as a man with a honey-soaked accent got on the microphone and commenced proceedings.
Biden’s long career in the public eye means that voters have formed a long-standing relationship with him. This familiarity has helped him weather blunders and flare-ups throughout the campaign that might have endangered lesser-known candidates.									SEAN RAYFORD / GETTY IMAGESJalon Roberson, a 22-year-old senior at Limestone, said that when he and other black students talked 2020, he found most of them were still on the fence about whom to support. Roberson liked both Biden and Harris, but saw issues with both. “I like that she’s devoted to law, but a lot of her past doesn’t line up with the angle she’s taking now,” he said of Harris. “A lot of black males are going to jail, getting put away, but now she comes out and she’s like, ‘Hey, I’m for black people, I eat pork chops, blah blah blah.’ I feel like she’s trying too hard to appeal to black people. I feel like there is a way to try and come across as sincere but you have to first acknowledge that you’re an outsider and say, ‘Hey, I want to appeal to you guys.’”
Biden, Roberston said, seemed like a moral guy, a good person. But, “he was in Iowa and he slipped up and he said poor kids are just as talented and bright as white kids. And I know that’s not what he meant and that’s not how he meant it to come across, but you can tell that there is an unconscious bias.” Roberson wanted to ask Biden about how to tackle that bias.
Roberson did get a question in, just not that one. As the beginning of golden hour set in over the crowd and the hottest part of the day came to an end, Biden was taking questions from the crowd in blue-and-white shirtsleeves. “A lot of young people my age, my race, we are trying to find the incentive to vote Democratic. Why should we trust the party, and how would your administration go about holding the party accountable?” Roberson asked him.
A good question, a fair question, Biden said. He began to weave his way through the folding chairs, a meandering walk to make eye contact with students seated a little further back on the lawn. One young black man stood on a short brick retaining wall in sunglasses, a pink button-down and a hoodie. Biden made his way toward the young man while he answered, hoping to drink up some eye contact. Just as Biden approached, almost standing in front of him, the young man flipped his hood up defiantly and Biden skillfully pivoted away. A confrontational moment avoided.
The answer continued for another few minutes, and the young man kept his eyes on Biden throughout. Biden mentioned the number of incarcerated black men and the crime bill — how most black people had supported it at the time. He talked about racial profiling in Newark, New Jersey — his favorite dig at Booker. Then, “We have systemic racism in the United States of America and it’s a white man’s problem. White men are responsible for it, not black men.” The young man on the wall said, “I agree,” to that, and clapped. It was a good answer for Biden, overall. He got applause for lines about teaching prisoners how to read, positioning prisoners to get proper housing after their time served. But Jalon Roberson and the young man in the hoodie are college kids, not prisoners. It struck me that Biden’s answer wholly ignored most of the issues that the black students at Limestone and elsewhere told me they were most worried about: student debt, raising the minimum wage, the environment. Biden’s defensiveness of his past had dominated the answer. Though he did throw in a sentence or two at the end about the American Dream — “that’s why we have to rebuild the middle class and this time, we bring everybody along” — he didn’t offer any specifics.
Biden had wanted desperately to prove himself worthy to the audience of students, but a vast gulf of age and experience separated him from Roberson and the young man in the hoodie. “Let’s hear it one more time for the next president of the United States, Joe Biden!” the MC intoned over the microphone. Everyone clapped. That was that.


If Biden wins the nomination — his third attempt to do so — he will be 77 years old. The party he leads has changed rapidly during his time in public life, becoming more liberal and diverse.									JUSTIN SULLIVAN / GETTY IMAGESI’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what Clyburn said about Biden’s tragedies. How the way he dealt with them had raised Biden in the esteem of many black voters, given the systemic hardships inflicted on them and their families over a couple of centuries in this country. Biden repurposed his suffering so it could be something more — a blessed experience, Clyburn said.
I’ve also spent a lot of time wondering why Biden ran for president this time around. He says publicly it has a lot to do with the wishes of his son Beau, who died in 2015, that he stay involved in public life. There’s ego at work, of course — it takes a massive one for a person to ever even consider running for president. But why after running for president twice, and losing soundly each time, would you do so again at age 76?
Biden might feel some sense of vocation this time around. Being a Catholic, he would recognize the Sunday school-ness of it all: what are you called to do? The way he gets fierce when he talks about winning back the Midwest, the bluster he spits when speaking about Trump’s misdeeds — it makes you think that there’s something twinging inside Biden that says, without a hint of irony, “I alone can fix this.” He wants to give people enough time to come to terms with a new American paradigm, while offering the familiar visage of an older white man standing guard. Biden sees himself as a singular salve and so do many black voters, pragmatic about the ability of America to readily accept change.
Biden isn’t alone, of course. There’s a moral imperative for each of the top three primary contenders, all in their 70s. Bernie Sanders and Warren proffer a promise of a golden, hopeful new system; Biden the restoration of one that was pretty good, if not perfect. If anything, the Democratic primary is something of a paean to old age, to lifelong ambitions and vocations yet to be fulfilled. It’s a monthslong slog as a trio of older white people bid to lead a country more black and brown than it’s ever been. I can see them — with more years behind them than ahead, in a world so different from the one they were born into — lingering longer than the rest of us over the most hashed-out lines of Tennyson’s “Ulysses”:
“You and I are old / Old age hath yet his honour and his toil / Death closes all: but something ere the end / Some work of noble note, may yet be done.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-blues-repeat-as-stanley-cup-champions/,2019-09-30,,,features,"Sep. 30, 2019",Will The Blues Be Stanley Cup Champions Again?,Terrence Doyle,FiveThirtyEight,NHL,"Before the end of last season, the St. Louis Blues were the most disappointing team in recent NHL history. In fact, they were among the most disappointing teams in recent North American sports history, period. They were almost always good, and they kept getting close to hockey’s summit — but they always seemed to fall flat when it mattered most. That all changed last June when the Bluenotes beat the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Final, exorcising a half-century of hockey demons.
As Stanley Cup champions are wont to do, the Blues spent their summer partying. In total, Blues players brought the Stanley Cup on a 28,830-mile, multi-continent celebratory road trip. They even made time to stop at a dive bar in the St. Louis suburb of Brentwood, where they signed flip-flops and whatever else Blues fans threw at them. And why not? The Game 7 win was the final step in an extraordinary journey that saw St. Louis rise from last place in January to become champions by June. If any team earned a party, it was last season’s Blues squad.
But after all those celebrations and vindications, the Blues are now back in a familiar role: underdogs. According to preseason Stanley Cup odds provided to FiveThirtyEight by the betting sites SportsBetting.ag and BetOnline.ag, St. Louis is a 16-to-1 bet to repeat its title as it takes the ice Wednesday on the first day of the 2019-20 season. After adjusting for the vigorish, those odds imply a mere 4.5 percent Cup probability for the defending champs, which is tied with the Florida Panthers and Winnipeg Jets for the sixth-best odds of any team.
For a defending champion, a 4.5 percent chance of repeating is outrageously low. Using archived odds from SportsBetting/BetOnline for seasons since 2010, combined with moneyline data from Hockey-Reference.com for seasons from 1985 to 2009, we cobbled together over three decades of implied preseason Stanley Cup probabilities. And over that span, no defending champ has gotten less respect from the preseason bookmakers than these St. Louis Blues.

Some of that is probably connected to residual doubts over just how good the Blues actually were last season — and how much of their story was simply the Cinderella tale of a team getting hot at exactly the right time. According to Hockey-Reference, St. Louis’s Simple Rating System score — a metric that adjusts a team’s goal differential for its strength of schedule — was only +0.28 goals per game better than average, which tied the 2008-09 Pittsburgh Penguins for third-lowest among Stanley Cup champs since 1970, ahead of only the 2011-12 L.A. Kings and the 2017-18 Washington Capitals.
The team did make an effort to spruce up its roster over the summer. Just last week, St. Louis swung a trade with the Carolina Hurricanes for defenseman Justin Faulk, who ranked 29th among all blue-liners last season with 10.2 Goals Versus Threshold (GVT), a measure of value in terms of goals added and saved above a replacement-level player at the same position. The Blues gave up remarkably little to land such a big fish — in exchange for Faulk, they traded a prospect who hasn’t played an NHL game, a future seventh-round draft pick and defenseman Joel Edmundson.
Edmundson played in five Stanley Cup Final games for the Blues, but St. Louis will gladly forfeit that championship experience for a defenseman of Faulk’s pedigree. Edmundson’s GVT was just 3.6 in 2018-19, far below Faulk’s mark, and unlike Faulk, Edmundson doesn’t pose much of a scoring threat. In 269 career games, Edmundson has notched just 52 points, or just 0.19 points per game. Faulk, on the other hand, has scored 258 points in 559 career games, including 40 goals on the power play. Jettisoning Edmundson in exchange for Faulk also means that St. Louis will likely have to kill fewer penalties in 2019-20: In fewer than half the regular-season games played, Edmundson has racked up nearly the same number of penalty minutes as Faulk has.
Faulk should reinforce a defense that was already very good, Edmundson’s presence notwithstanding. Along with the Canes, the Blues gave up the third-fewest shots per game during the 2018-19 regular season, and along with the Arizona Coyotes, they gave up the fifth-fewest goals. And during the playoffs, only the Canes surrendered fewer shots per game among teams that played at least five games. The addition of Faulk to a blue-line group that already includes Jay Bouwmeester, Alex Pietrangelo and Colton Parayko makes the St. Louis rearguard one of the best in hockey.
Unlike many of the other teams on the list of unlikely repeat bids from above, the Blues didn’t lose a star.1 Still, aside from the addition of Faulk, they’re pretty much rolling with the same crew that won it all a season ago.

That might not be such a bad thing. The arrival of Faulk reinforces a clear strength for St. Louis, which is its depth — 13 Blues scored at least 10 goals last season. The Blues are also hoping for a repeat performance between the pipes from Jordan Binnington: The goalie led the NHL in goals against average during the regular season (allowing just 1.89 goals per 60 minutes). He was highly inconsistent during the playoffs, but if he can recapture his regular-season form, the Blues should find themselves in the playoffs again and with a chance to make another run at the Cup.
To be sure, the Blues probably have the right to feel a bit put out by the bookmakers’ preseason Stanley Cup odds. Repeating as champions is notoriously difficult — it’s only happened three times in the past three decades — but the Blues are returning a nearly identical roster, plus one of the league’s best young defensemen. And they’ve been the best hockey team on the planet since January, showing few signs that any sort of significant slump is on the horizon. The bookmakers don’t like the Blues’ chances this season. But then again, they didn’t like the Blues’ chances halfway through last season, either. And look how that turned out.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

45 million online photos and videos
Last year, technology companies reported 45 million online photos and videos of child sexual abuse to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Almost two-thirds of the worldwide reports of child sexual abuse material were about material on Facebook Messenger. Among many reasons it’s hard for authorities to deal with the problem: federal funding to combat it has remained flat and there is high staff turnover on this beat due to graphic and emotionally draining work. [New York Times]
31 degrees celsius
In addition to sparse crowds, marathon athletes at the World Athletics Championships in Doha experienced brutal conditions on Saturday morning, with outdoor temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius (88 degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in only 40 out of 68 competitors completing the race and several others requiring medical attention due to high humidity levels. By comparison, track and field athletes completed their events within an air-conditioned stadium set at 23 degrees celsius. “There is nothing to breathe,” Belarus athlete Volha Mazuronak said. “I thought I wouldn’t finish.” [The Guardian]
17th weekend of protests
Clashes between police and members of the public took place again on Hong Kong’s busy commercial streets on Sunday after thousands of protesters participated in the city’s 17th-straight weekend of protests. Several subway stations were closed in anticipation of conflict, but the entrance to one was eventually set on fire after protestors were unable to open its shuttered gate. More than 100 people were arrested, and two dozen others were taken to a hospital with injuries. [South China Morning Post]
13th amendment
The 13th Amendment banned slavery and involuntary servitude, but Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he regretted referencing it when mentioning a new policy that would allow alumni to donate to any of the educational institution’s colleges. The Boston Globe first reported Bacow had told hundreds of alumni and development staff at a meeting on Tuesday that “donors no longer could be owned by the specific colleges from which they had graduated.” The Ivy League university has its own history with slavery, including a plaque which honors four people who were enslaved by Harvard in the 18th century. [Boston Globe]
$914,831 in parking fines
Data shows Canada Post, the Canadian national mail service, has accumulated nearly $7.5 million in parking tickets over the last decade. Analysis from the Canadian Press shows last year’s tickets totaled $914,831, with most of the citations are in and around the city of Toronto. However, the parking fines are a small dent in Canada Post’s balance sheet, which lost $270 million last year on revenue of $6.6 billion dollars. [Canadian Press/CBC News]
Food52
Retail, recipe, and home-improvement advice company Food52 announced it had sold a stake to a venture capital firm that values Food52 at more than $100 million. The company was founded 10 years ago by two veteran food journalists who used to work for the New York Times and regularly incorporates customer feedback into the development of its custom dining and retail products.

It’s a high-stakes moment — for President Trump, for Democrats and for pollsters. It’s also a scary moment for polling.
Yes, people who follow politics are now intensely interested in whether the latest developments might shift public opinion about Trump and impeachment. But when news is exceptionally big, a growing body of evidence suggests it can throw off the accuracy of polling itself.
The problem comes from what pollsters call “differential nonresponse bias.” The idea behind this complex-sounding term is fairly straightforward: If partisans on one side of a political question respond to a survey more readily than partisans on the other side, you can get a polling error. The results in your poll won’t match the real-world opinion you’re trying to measure — instead, the poll will be skewed by how willing some people are to respond to a survey.
Some folks see potential for nonresponse to wreak havoc on nearly every poll, but actual evidence of nonresponse bias is hard to come by. There are known patterns in the way people respond to surveys — Americans with more education are more likely to take a poll, for example. But pollsters study these patterns and try to correct for them, which usually allows them to avoid error, though sometimes not.
For the most part, pollsters’ adjustments do a pretty good job of accounting for nonresponse problems, especially in big national polls.
The exception, however, comes with the highest of high-profile news events. We have evidence of several brief episodes of nonresponse error, and all three came in the wake of big news stories near the conclusion of an election — in 2012, 2016 and 2018.
During the 2012 campaign, pollsters who conducted “panel” surveys — polls that recontact previously interviewed respondents to see whether individuals’ opinions change over time — found an unusual result: Republicans were more likely than Democrats to respond to follow-up surveys fielded just after the first presidential debate, which news coverage treated as an unambiguous win for challenger Mitt Romney against then-President Barack Obama. Polls showed Romney chipping away at Obama’s lead. But rather than voters changing their minds about who to vote for (and therefore changing the likely election result), much of the shift may have been caused by a change in what kinds of people were responding to surveys.
During the 2016 campaign, YouGov found Trump’s supporters were less likely than Hillary Clinton supporters to participate in panel reinterviews conducted just after the release of the “Access Hollywood” tape.
Finally, during the 2018 midterms, following the nationally televised congressional hearing in which Christine Blasey Ford leveled accusations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh, who was then a Supreme Court nominee, we saw something similar in the polling I helped conduct at SurveyMonkey.
The survey completion rate jumped 3 percentage points among those who expressed approval of Trump while remaining essentially flat among those who expressed disapproval. The changes in completion rate among Trump approvers vs. disapprovers increased the share of self-identified Republicans and conservatives, non-college-educated women and respondents in rural ZIP codes in our unweighted data.

Put more simply, the composition of our samples changed, and even after demographic weighting, the respondent pool included more of the kinds of people who tend to support Trump. As a result, we also saw what appeared to be an increase in Trump’s approval rating among all U.S. adults. Yet that trend was mostly an artifact of the response patterns; it didn’t reflect a meaningful real-world change in how Americans viewed Trump.
Indeed, by the end of October, the higher completion rates among Trump approvers, the change in the demographic and geographic composition of our unweighted data, and the corresponding bump in Trump’s approval rating had all faded, reverting back to where they had been through much of the summer.
What do these phantom trends have in common? Each came about a month before a national election, which may speak to the power of election campaigns in heightening awareness of political news. But more importantly, each involved the kind of story that FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver recently described, in the context of handling “outlier” polls, as “spectacular, blockbuster news events that dominate the news cycle for a week or more,” the sort of story that happens only once or twice in an election cycle.
The story of Trump’s Ukraine call and the impeachment inquiry is not there yet, in my view, but we are getting closer. For now, the news is big in the political media, but most Americans still don’t know much about it. Whether it grows to the sort of everyone-is-talking-about-it status that the Kavanaugh hearings or the “Access Hollywood” tape reached remains to be seen. A dramatic live-television hearing featuring the Ukraine whistleblower, or the release of further compelling evidence, could push the story into that true blockbuster category.
At that point, it will be critical to watch the polling data for signs of nonresponse bias: Specifically, do polls appear to show sudden and “statistically significant” shifts in party identification?1 If, for example, support for impeachment grows, will it be because Americans are genuinely warming to the idea or simply because Democrats are becoming more likely to take surveys than Republicans?
One test: Check the pollster’s previous surveys to see if the percentages of respondents who identify as Democrats, Republicans and independents have changed notably. Of course, any apparent shifts in partisan identification could be real — party identification is an attitude, so it can and does change — but that balance usually shifts at a glacial pace. A sudden, significant change in the partisan composition of the response pool would be reason for skepticism.2
Also, when big news strikes and there’s reason to worry about response bias, two particular kinds of polls are especially valuable:
First, those that recontact people interviewed previously, like those that detected the phantom trends during the 2012 and 2016 elections, are especially valuable. These panel surveys can directly measure nonresponse bias, and they can also identify real, individual-level changes in public opinion.
Second, polls that use samples drawn from lists of registered voters also have an advantage. They can detect directly whether Democrats tend to respond more readily than Republicans, or vice versa, based on data in official records. If you’re polling people drawn from a list of registered voters, you have more concrete evidence of someone’s partisan loyalty, including party registration in states that record it, primary vote history in other states, or scores that combine all available predictors of partisanship.
Ultimately, should the next polling result on impeachment look like an outlier compared to past results, the best advice is what Nate offered a few weeks ago, but with a twist: Be open to the possibility that the impeachment story is big enough to produce real change, but be cautious. First, be cautious by looking at a polling average that includes the new result instead of just looking at the new result on its own. And second — and this is the twist — stay somewhat skeptical of new polls if this story gets so big that it shows signs of distorting the polls themselves. Either way, it will probably take several weeks, and many new polls, to know for certain.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/quarterbacks-usually-regress-after-historic-seasons-not-patrick-mahomes/,2019-09-27,,,features,"Sep. 25, 2019",QBs Usually Regress After Historic Seasons. Not Patrick Mahomes.,Michael Salfino,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"Patrick Mahomes had one of the NFL’s greatest quarterback seasons in his first year as a starter in 2018. We would have expected him to falter a bit after such a season, as has been the case with other historic passing performers. But something unusual is happening through the first three weeks of this season: He’s not only keeping the regression wolves at bay, he’s actually besting them.
Last season, Mahomes threw 50 touchdown passes, tied for the second-most ever in NFL history. He is one of only seven quarterbacks in history to exceed 5,000 passing yards in a single season. Kansas City’s 565 points scored were third-most in NFL history.
You’d think there would be nowhere to go but down. After all, no QB who has tossed even 40 touchdowns in a season has ever thrown more the following year. And the average dropoff in touchdowns has been 18.8.
But who says gravity always wins? Mahomes is on pace for 53 touchdowns and — hold on to your hats — 6,373 passing yards.
Even more impressive than Mahomes’s current TD pace are the yards. After Joe Namath first cracked the 4,000-yard barrier in 1967, it took 12 years (and adding two extra games) for anyone else to match it. Then, in 1984, Dan Marino topped 5,000 yards — a feat that would not be repeated until Drew Brees threw for 5,069 yards in 2008. Now, Mahomes isn’t just on pace to repeat 5,000 passing yards1, but to easily crack 6,000. No quarterback has come within 500 yards of that mark. And if Mahomes keeps his 2019 pace, history tells us that it could be decades before anyone does it again.

Mahomes’s has been relentless in his pursuit of all-time passing records. He’s posted 14 consecutive games with two or more TD passes, just one shy of Peyton Manning’s record spanning the 2013 and 2014 seasons. And he’s started the season throwing for more than 350 yards in each game, which is also just one short of the record — four games — shared by just two quarterbacks: Matthew Stafford (2011-12) and Drew Brees (2011). The Chiefs and Mahomes are at Detroit on Sunday to face Stafford and the Lions, who are ranked 22nd in passing yards allowed.
After failing to lead his college team to a winning record, few would have expected Mahomes — the 10th overall pick in the 2017 draft — to have such a historic start to his NFL career. I wrote in the Wall Street Journal at the time that a losing record in college is usually a bad harbinger for QB prospects. Former NFL coach Bill Parcells told me, “If you are going to be a very good pro quarterback, not even elite, you should at least have won most of your games in college.”
Mahomes’s college stats were good, for sure, but nothing that would have guaranteed greatness as a pro. In terms of passing efficiency, of the 1,162 qualifying quarterback-seasons of at least 300 passes from 2000 to 2016 (Mahomes’s last year in college), Mahomes’ final season at Texas Tech ranked 123rd, good for the 89th percentile. But he’s playing like a 99th percentile NFL quarterback.
How?
We’re seeing the perfect merger of a quarterback with enormous arm strength (he threw the ball out of his home stadium), accuracy and a receiving corps that runs like a relay team. Sammy Watkins clocked a 4.43 40-yard dash, Mecole Hardman timed 4.33, and the injured Tyreek Hill ran a 4.26 at his pro day. Hill’s replacement, Demarcus Robinson, is slow in comparison with a 4.59 time, yet he already has three TDs and has averaged 23.9 yards per catch in his two starts replacing Hill. Have I mentioned that Mahomes is going to get Hill back soon? (He’s no longer in a sling.) And don’t forget that Travis Kelce is one of the game’s fastest tight ends, with a 40-yard dash time of 4.61.
And Mahomes has a head coach in Andy Reid who has tailored the offense to his quarterback’s strength: throwing downfield with uncanny accuracy. Consider that Mahomes this year already has 12 completions of 20 or more air yards (in 20 attempts), according to ESPN’s Stats & Information Group. That’s a pace of 64 for the season, which would shatter the record since 2001 of 39 shared by the Eli Manning (2011) and Blake Bortles (2015). And it’s on pace to nearly double the Chiefs’ deep-passing completions last season (37). Put another way, Reid’s scheme has enabled Mahomes to be on pace for more than 2,700 yards just on deep passes — that would be nearly double the record of 1,446 yards set by the 2011 Packers.
The Chiefs and Mahomes are taking their trademark deep passing game to even greater heights this year, and NFL defenses have not yet been able to tap the breaks on Mahomes’s aerial exploits. Mahomes — along with his receivers — has stayed more than a couple steps ahead of them. In the process, he could be creating a new magic number for NFL quarterbacks.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Poll(s) of the week
In the week since The Wall Street Journal first broke the news that President Trump allegedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in a July phone call, six pollsters1 have released surveys asking Americans whether they support impeaching the president.
The polling we have so far mostly shows an uptick in support for impeachment. But according to the initial polls at least, public opinion doesn’t seem to have shifted dramatically from where it was following both the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on April 18 and Mueller’s testimony before Congress on July 24. The majority of Americans still do not favor impeachment, although more than two-thirds of Democrats do. There are several reasons, however, to believe that this picture is incomplete and could change.
Most early polls show uptick in support for impeachment

*For polls released before Sept. 27, 2019.
**The post-Mueller-testimony YouGov/HuffPost number is from a poll conducted Aug. 9-10; that pollster’s July poll was conducted before the testimony.
Polls started on or after the relevant date with the exception of the post-Ukraine Quinnipiac poll, which started the day before that story broke. Different polls survey different subsets of the U.S. population (e.g. all adults, registered voters, likely voters).
Source: Polls
First, although support for impeaching the president is shy of a majority, polling suggests that a majority of Americans do disapprove of Trump’s actions. A YouGov/Economist poll released Wednesday found that 52 percent of Americans said it is inappropriate for the president to request a foreign government open an investigation into a potential political opponent. (By contrast, 22 percent said it was appropriate, and 26 percent said they weren’t sure.) And in that same poll, 62 percent of Americans said that it is inappropriate for the president to threaten withholding foreign aid to a country if it refuses to “take an action which personally benefits the President.” (Only 14 percent said it is appropriate, and 24 percent were not sure.)
But as editor-in-chief Nate Silver pointed out on Tuesday, just because a majority disapproves of the president’s actions doesn’t mean a majority supports impeaching him. In the Quinnipiac University poll that came out after the publication of the Mueller report, for example, 54 percent of Americans thought Trump had “attempted to derail or obstruct the investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election,” and 46 percent thought Trump had committed crimes while president, but only 29 percent said Congress should begin the impeachment process.
So support for impeachment could remain low this time around, too, but it could also be different. A separate YouGov poll conducted Tuesday found that a majority of Americans may either “strongly” or “somewhat” support impeachment if Trump “suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country’s officials to investigate his political rival.”
And that’s not the only evidence to suggest that support for impeachment could increase. Of the five polls from which we have data so far, one is from a high-quality telephone pollster — Quinnipiac. And their latest poll shows a 5-percentage-point increase in support for impeachment overall and a 12-percentage-point increase among Democrats since they were last asked the question in July. Keep in mind, too, this poll went into the field on Sept. 19 — a full day before The Wall Street Journal first broke the story of Trump’s call with Zelensky, and only stayed in the field through Monday, the day before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry.
But, of course, it’s important to note that all of this polling is really preliminary. Even over the course of this week, a lot has happened that the polls don’t account for. For example, not all of these polls capture changes in public opinion following Pelosi’s announcement of an official impeachment inquiry, nor do they capture public reactions to the memo of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky that the White House released on Wednesday. And none of them factor in the testimony of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire before Congress on Thursday morning.
Americans may still be digesting the flurry of news and deciding how they feel about it. According to a Marist poll conducted Wednesday, 32 percent of Americans said they weren’t closely following news about the impeachment inquiry. And according to the YouGov/HuffPost poll, when asked if they found the allegation that Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden’s son credible, 42 percent of respondents said that they weren’t sure or hadn’t heard enough to say. So as Americans learn more about the impeachment inquiry, they could start to support it more, or they could support it less. We’ll be tracking the polls to find out.
Other polling bites
The U.N. General Assembly met in New York this week for its 74th session. According to a survey from the Pew Research Center, opinions of the international organization in the U.S. are growing more partisan. Fewer Republicans have a favorable view of the body now than at any time in the last three decades.

According to a YouGov/Huffpost poll, about half of Republicans are either “somewhat” or “very” concerned about climate change. Younger members of the GOP were much more likely to be worried — 69 percent of Republicans under the age of 45 reported concern over the climate, but only 38 percent of those over 45 did.
A Selzer poll of likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren as the first choice of 22 percent of voters, putting her neck-and-neck with former Vice President Joe Biden, who had 20 percent support. Bernie Sanders came in third with 11 percent. The poll, which was sponsored by the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom, has a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points, which means Warren and Biden are more or less tied. Selzer is known for its track record of accuracy, so it tends to get a lot of attention. Don’t take it too seriously, though — the Iowa caucus still a few months away.
A Monmouth University poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters also found Warren in a virtual tie with Biden. Warren led Biden 27 to 25 percent in the poll, which had a margin of error of +/-4.9 percentage points. That’s a 19 percentage-point increase for Warren and an 11 percentage-point decrease for Biden since May, when Monmouth last polled New Hampshire voters.
A Gallup poll conducted this month found that of the three branches of government, Americans trust the judicial branch the most. Sixty-nine percent said they trust the judicial branch either a “great deal” or a “fair amount,” 45 percent said the same of the executive branch, and 38 percent said so of the legislative branch.
The Quinnipiac poll featured in the “Poll of the week” section above also found that Democrats are split on the best way to deal with the health care system. Forty-four percent said it’s better to keep the private health insurance system and build on Obamacare, while 47 percent said they prefer to replace the current system with “Medicare for All.”
40 percent of Americans, a plurality, told YouGov in a poll this week that fall was their favorite season. But when YouGov asked the question in January 2014, spring topped the list as Americans’ favorite season, though summer and fall were only 1 and 2 points behind, respectively. (In both polls, very few people liked winter.) Gallup asked Americans about their favorite season in 1947, 1960 and 2005 — and found each time that spring was favored.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized after multiple photos and videos surfaced of him wearing brownface and blackface makeup. Some initial polls after the news became public showed Trudeau’s party may have lost some ground over the issue, but others have shown the Liberals starting to bounce back. Although the effects of the racist images on Trudeau’s prospects seem relatively small so far, even a small dip could matter, since polls are showing a close race heading into next month’s election.
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 42.8 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -10.4 points). At this time last week, 42.1 percent approved and 53.7 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -11.6 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 41.5 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.9 percent, for a net approval rating of -12.4 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.8 percentage points (46.8 percent to 40.0 percent). Those numbers haven’t budged in a week. At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.5 points (46.3 percent to 39.8 percent).",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

With 9:45 left in the fourth quarter and trailing 17-13, the Browns advanced to the Rams’ 41-yard line. A first-down run by Nick Chubb and two subsequent passes by Baker Mayfield netted Cleveland a single yard, and head coach Freddie Kitchens was faced with a difficult fourth-and-9 decision. In response, he dialed up a play call that is unprecedented in recorded NFL history: a draw.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cle_4thdown.mp4
A draw play is designed to make the defense believe that a pass is coming, but instead results in a delayed handoff to the running back. The version the Browns ran gained just 2 yards, so Cleveland turned the ball over on downs. To be fair to Kitchens, it was a bold call in adverse circumstances. The analytically inclined are sometimes guilty of screaming at the TV for teams to be aggressive on fourth down and then — if the play is unsuccessful — immediately turning around and loudly complaining about the play call. But even given the results-oriented bias of the NFL fanbase, a draw play on fourth down and long is still a very rare and deeply contrarian move.
Since 2006 — the first year ESPN began tracking play types — teams have dialed up a draw just 26 times on fourth down, including the Browns’ failed attempt. In that same period, no team outside of Cleveland has called a draw on fourth down with more than 7 yards to go. Among this small sample, just one draw has successfully converted to a new set of downs with more than 3 yards to go — and the quarterback responsible was noted gridiron sorcerer Ryan Fitzpatrick back when he was starting for the Buffalo Bills in 2011.
Still, faulting Kitchens for calling a draw just because few have been called historically from that distance might be unfair. Draws work more often than not when they are called on fourth and short, for instance.1 And the conversion rate on a slightly more recent sample of plays — there have been 16 since 2009, the year our dataset begins — is a robust 62.5 percent, so the play can work in the right situations. Meanwhile, the success rate for all fourth-down plays with exactly 9 yards to go — the same distance Kitchens was faced with — is an anemic 35.4 percent. It’s hard to blame a specific play type when the odds against success are stacked so high.
This made us wonder if there were play types that have historically been successful in fourth-and-long situations. Historical charting is somewhat limited in the NFL, but we found five other play types we could compare to the draw across the period spanning from 2009 to 2019. Sample sizes are notoriously small for fourth- and- long plays due to the NFL’s aversion to aggressive play calling, but among the play types for which we have data, play-action is the most common.

There simply isn’t a lot of evidence to guide decision making in these situations. But if we look at the relative frequency of each type of play call and break each out by success or failure, there is a play type that historically has seen reasonable success on fourth and 5 or more: the screen pass.

Screen passes are short passes to a receiver that start off looking like deeper passes or runs. Linemen — usually the center and two guards — begin the play blocking as normal but will release their defenders in an attempt to get them to overcommit to rushing the quarterback. A well-executed screen usually requires the QB to wait until the opposing linemen are almost on him before he tosses the ball to the receiver. Ideally, the scrum of suddenly free offensive linemen then begin to rumble downfield in search of a smaller linebacker or defensive back to block into the turf.
Acknowledging the fact that we have limited charting of play types, the screen is the only play type that has been successful the majority of the time on fourth down and between 5 and 9 yards to go. The sample size is admittedly tiny — just 10 plays — so any notion of statistical significance goes right out the window, but teams were able to successfully convert a first down on six of the 10 attempts, good for 20 percentage points over league average for the given down and distance.
Perhaps the deception afforded by convincing the defense that a long pass is coming improves the play’s outcome. It’s interesting to note that of the play types under consideration, the screen is the worst performing on fourth and short — and on fourth-down plays overall.

For screens to succeed, the offense needs defenders to respect the pass and try to sack the QB so space can develop for the receiver to operate. On fourth and short, considerations of containing the pass likely take a back seat to stopping the run. The numbers seem to bear this out. When all distances on fourth down are considered, the screen is the worst-performing play on average.
Kitchens and the Browns might have given themselves a better shot at extending their drive had they chosen another play type on Sunday. A screen might have led to a better pay-off for their aggressive play call. Then again, given the dearth of data we have to work with, perhaps it’s just noise.

The Mystics point guard had appointed herself the “campaign manager” for teammate Elena Delle Donne’s push to win the WNBA Most Valuable Player award. (Her sworn duties include making goat noises any time she is asked about Delle Donne, whom she considers the WNBA’s “greatest of all time,” or GOAT.) So, after the game, Cloud gave a rousing, off-the-cuff speech about her teammate:
“She [is] the MVP. Every single day she comes in with the same efficiency, whether she’s tired, whether she’s hurting, whether she’s fatigued. And when you have that in your leader, it’s easy to follow her example. So I’m going to keep campaigning for her. I like to call myself her campaign manager, but there’s no campaign. Anyone with eyes can see that she’s the MVP of this league. At this point, to even debate otherwise, it’s like a slap in her face. … I’m tired of any negotiations. Elena Delle Donne is the MVP of this league.”
A few minutes later, with most of the media having already filtered out of the locker room, Cloud couldn’t resist showing off a photo on her phone of a custom sweatshirt she had made. It had Delle Donne’s picture on the front and “MVP” in red letters on the back. “Don’t tag Elena yet, OK, y’all?” Cloud said, wanting to keep it a secret until the MVP results were officially announced. “Because I already have my sweatshirt made. … Y’all see it?” She added, “I’m gonna be out here in these streets wearing it. … She’s the best player in the entire world.”
Cloud would have to wait 10 more days, but Delle Donne was indeed named the 2019 WNBA Most Valuable Player — and it wasn’t close. Delle Donne secured 41 of 43 first-place votes from the panel of national media members after a season in which she averaged nearly 20 points per game and became the first WNBA player to shoot 50 percent from the field, 40 percent on 3-pointers and 90 percent at the free-throw line.1
But Cloud wasn’t satisfied: “How do you not unanimously name Elena Delle Donne, the first player ever in the WNBA to [shoot] 50-40-90, who shoots as efficient as she does, who upped her defense, who upped her rebounds. … She upgraded all facets of the box score.” Cloud blamed the two first-place votes that Delle Donne did not secure on “bias” and added, “People were laughing when I was campaigning, but I was just making sure everyone knew who the real MVP was.”
To be sure, there are plenty of arguments supporting Delle Donne’s MVP candidacy. Delle Donne finished second in the WNBA in points per game (19.5), fifth in rebounds per game (8.2) and 11th in blocks per game (1.3). Her advanced statistics were even more impressive: She led the league in true shooting percentage, player efficiency rating and win shares while also posting the lowest turnover rate, just 5.9 percent.
It also helps Delle Donne’s case that she is the best player on the WNBA’s best team this season — and one of the best teams of all time. The Mysticshad the largest margin of victory (19.5 points) and the most efficient offense (1.13 points per possession) in WNBA history, breaking records that had stood since the 2000 Houston Comets. The Mystics also broke much newer records set by the 2018 Seattle Storm, including assists in a season, 3-pointers made and 3-pointers attempted. In all, the Mystics set seven new individual franchise records, more than a dozen team franchise records and a whopping 15 team WNBA records this season, plus Delle Donne’s historic 50-40-90. If the Mystics win the championship — they face the Connecticut Sun in the WNBA Finals starting Sunday — they will arguably be the best team in the WNBA’s 23-year history.
As Cloud alluded to when she criticized the two dissenting MVP voters, Delle Donne has somehow stepped up her game every year in Washington. She’s been an All-Star all three seasons, but in 2019 she posted her highest points, rebounds and assists per 40 minutes; her highest PER; and her highest total win shares and win shares per 40 minutes:

Delle Donne has continued to step up her game in the WNBA playoffs. Through four playoff games this season, she is averaging 21.3 points per game on 46 percent shooting, both up slightly compared with her 2018 playoff numbers. She has topped 20 points in three of four games so far and secured her 200th career playoff rebound in Game 4 of the semifinals against Las Vegas. Delle Donne has also made her presence felt defensively this postseason, registering exactly as many steals (five) and blocks (seven) in the 2019 playoffs as she did in all eight playoff games in 2018.
Meanwhile, Cloud has been on an upward trajectory of her own since Washington drafted her in the second round in 2015. She has started 106 of 150 career regular-season games and really hit her stride a season ago, when she was the runner-up for WNBA Most Improved Player. This season, she has been even better, setting new career highs in points (9.0), assists (5.6) and steals (1.0) per game. She also made the WNBA’s All-Defensive Second Team for the first time in her career and set the Mystics’ career and single-season assist records. In the playoffs, she is averaging 11.5 points and 7.3 assists on 43 percent shooting.
When Cloud was asked about her role after a win over the Dallas Wings on Sept. 6, she made it clear that she wants to win every battle on both ends of the court. “I’m the facilitator, the quarterback, [for] all of our offense,” she said. “I’m our best perimeter defender, so I take a lot of pride in that.” But she credited her teammates for her individual success, explaining that “when you have some of the best scorers in the world on your team, it makes my job easier of just finding them in successful situations.”
Cloud also reflected on her growth and that of her team that September weekend. With fellow starter Kristi Toliver nursing an injury, Cloud played 35, 38 and 37 minutes in three straight games near the end of the season, and she admitted, “If you would’ve asked me to play this many minutes three years ago, I just wouldn’t have been conditioned for it.” But Cloud has continually worked to improve her game — just like the Mystics, she explained. “We’ve grown together over the last three years. We restructured our roster three years ago. We moved Kristi and Elena in and moved some people out as well the last two years, so I think you’re just seeing us grow together.”
This season, buoyed by a deep and talented supporting cast, the Mystics have grown into an elite team. Seven players averaged at least 9.0 points per game during the regular season, and each of them led the team in scoring at least twice. Nine different players made at least one start, which shook up the self-named “bench mob” at times, but the reserves averaged more than 30 points per game and outscored the opponent’s reserves in 26 of 34 games. Last month, when asked why the Mystics are so hard to defend, Los Angeles Sparks star Candace Parker said, “Number one, they share the ball.”
In particular, it’s easy to see how Cloud and Delle Donne’s chemistry has developed since the latter’s first season in Washington in 2017. That year, as a reserve averaging just less than 19 minutes per game, Cloud assisted on just 13 of Delle Donne’s baskets in the regular season and playoffs, according to data provided by Positive Residual. Last season, that number quadrupled to 52, and this season, it was 58 through the Mystics’ first two playoff games.
Part of that increase is due to Cloud playing a lot more minutes — more than 1,200 this year and counting, compared with 5352 in 2017. But the data also shows that Cloud has figured out when, where and how to get her MVP the ball:

In 2017, Cloud assisted on 7.2 percent of all Mystics field goals and 6.7 percent of Delle Donne’s field goals. The following season, she flipped the script, assisting Delle Donne 6 percentage points more often than she assisted the entire team. This season, the difference is up to 7.6 percentage points, and she has assisted on nearly a quarter of Delle Donne’s field goals this season.

Of course, about one-third of the baskets by Delle Donne and the entire Mystics squad are unassisted this season.3 Looking at just the assisted field goals shows again that Cloud has fed Delle Donne at a higher rate each season since 2017, and that rate is increasingly disproportionate to the rate she assists the team as a whole. Most remarkably, nearly 40 percent of Delle Donne’s assisted field goals this season have come off passes from Cloud.
On the day Delle Donne won her second MVP trophy, Cloud gave a tongue-in-cheek acceptance speech in the locker room. Cloud said, “We did it, campaigned it, we pushed for it. I’m just, I’m so happy for this award, not only for myself but for Elena Delle Donne.” Cloud was Delle Donne’s MVP campaign manager off the court, but she also effectively managed Delle Donne’s campaign on the court, and the results have been staggering: Delle Donne posted a season for the ages, shooting more efficiently than any player in WNBA history and all but eight NBA players ever. As a result, the Mystics are on the cusp of WNBA history.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Inspired by the Brewers’ apparent mediocrity (they’ve since gone on a roll to clinch a playoff spot) Jibriel asks the following:
If a baseball team is truly .500, meaning it has a 50 percent chance of winning each game, what’s the probability that it has won two of its last four games and four of its last eight games?

Riddler Classic
Riddler League Baseball, also known as the RLB, consists of three teams: the Mississippi Moonwalkers, the Delaware Doubloons and the Tennessee Taters.
Each time a batter for the Moonwalkers comes to the plate, they have a 40 percent chance of getting a walk and a 60 percent chance of striking out. Each batter for the Doubloons, meanwhile, hits a double 20 percent percent of the time, driving in any teammates who are on base, and strikes out the remaining 80 percent of the time. Finally, each batter for the Taters has a 10 percent chance of hitting a home run and a 90 percent chance of striking out.
During the RLB season, each team plays an equal number of games against each opponent. Games are nine innings long and can go into extra innings just like in other baseball leagues. Which of the three teams is most likely to have the best record at the end of the season?

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏Michael DeLyser 👏 of State College, Pennsylvania, winner of last week’s Riddler Express.
Last week, Riddler Nation needed help designing the logo for the new Riddler Express™ credit card, which consisted of two overlapping circles with radius 1 inch, creating three distinct regions: one region that’s shared between the two circles and two regions that are part of one circle, but not the other.
In particular, the areas of all three regions had to be exactly the same. How far apart must the centers of the two circles have been?
If the two circles are far apart, the area of the overlapping region is very small. As you move the circles closer together, at some point the area of the middle region will precisely equal the areas of the two outer regions. By moving the circles in this way, Dogan Kazakli determined that the areas are equal when the circles are approximately 0.81 inches apart.


Here's a story of three regions that end up having the same area.  @xaqwg https://t.co/uWibvStYvr pic.twitter.com/cUBUo3jCLN
— Dogan Kazakli (@doganck) September 23, 2019

Solver Brian Corrigan gave this exact problem to his high school students late last year, and he was able to nail down the distance with greater precision using calculus — integrating the areas of the different regions and setting them equal. Alan Greenburg took a trigonometric approach, splitting the middle region into two equal circular segments. This leads to an equation for the distance d between the circles:

Unfortunately, there’s no simple expression for d beyond this equation, but a computer will tell you that d is approximately 0.8079455 inches.
For extra credit, you were asked to arrange three circles so that the areas of the largest and smallest of the seven resulting regions were as close to equivalent as possible. Here’s an animation showing how the difference between the largest and smallest areas changed along with the distance between the circles:
If you watch very carefully, you can see that the difference is minimized when the circles are a little more than 0.8 inches apart, a distance that closely resembles the answer from the two-circle problem. Surely the answers aren’t the same for both two circles and three circles. But as solver Grant Larsen found, they are indeed the same! He reasoned that the areas are closest when regions I and III in the image below have the same area. That means the combined area of regions I and II (the middle region from the two-circle problem) must equal the combined area of regions III plus II (the outer region from the two-circle problem). So the answer to the extra credit was, once again, approximately 0.8079455 inches.
By the way, if you’d like to know the answer to even more decimal places, you can find it here. Apparently this sequence of digits is kind of a big deal.
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏Gavin Lee 👏 of New York, New York, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic.
In last week’s Riddler Classic, you were the coach for Team Riddler at the Tour de FiveThirtyEight, where there were 20 teams. Your objective was to win the Team Time Trial race, which had the following rules:
Each team rode as a group at a fixed pace, specified by that team’s coach. Teams that couldn’t maintain their pace had “cracked” and didn’t finish the course.
The fastest team to finish the course was the winner.
Teams rode the course one at a time and were aware of the results of all previous teams.
All teams were of equal ability, and the faster the pace, the greater the probability of cracking. Team Riddler was the first team to attempt the course. How likely were they to finish the course while maximizing their chances of winning?
Gavin assumed Team Riddler would finish the course with probability p and that there were N total teams. If Team Riddler cracked, they’d certainly lose, giving that event probability 1-p. If Team Riddler finished the course, then the second team would ride at a pace that was ever so slightly faster than Team Riddler’s, giving it a similar probability p of finishing the course. Therefore, in order to win, Team Riddler needed to finish the course, with probability p, while the remaining N-1 teams each needed to crack, with probability 1-p. Since teams’ chances of cracking were independent, the probability of all this occurring was p(1-p)N-1. To maximize this probability, you can set its derivative equal to zero, finding that p = 1/N. When there are 20 teams, that means the probability that Team Riddler finishes the course was 1/20, or 5 percent. Plugging in this value of p reveals that Team Riddler’s chances of winning stood at a paltry 1.89 percent.
To solve the extra credit, you first needed to determine the optimal strategy for each team. If no team before you successfully finished the course, and there are N teams remaining (including them), then it’s just like being the first to compete among N teams, so you should select a pace such that your chances of finishing the course are 1/N. However, if any prior team finished the course, then you’re forced to attempt an ever so slightly faster pace than the current winning pace.
Now, to find Team Riddler’s chances of victory when it was the last to attempt the course, solver Jason Shaw broke things down into cases in his writeup. If the first team finishes the course, which we already know happens 1/20 of the time, then Team Riddler must ever so slightly beat them, also with probability 1/20. If the first team cracks, with probability 19/20, and the second team finishes the course, now with probability 1/19, then Team Riddler must beat that second team, again with a probability of 1/19. Continuing with this reasoning and working out all the cases, Jason found that when Team Riddler is the last to attempt the course, its chances of winning were 1/20×(1/20+1/19+1/18+…+1/1), a sum that’s just shy of 18 percent. Here are the chances of winning based on the order in which teams attempted the course:
In the Tour de FiveThirtyEight, it definitely pays to go last.
Finally, solver Sawyer Tabony extended the problem, considering what the first and last team’s chances of winning would be as more and more teams compete. For N teams, the solutions are beautifully concise: 1/(eN), and ln(N)/N, respectively. Surprise, surprise, this is yet another Riddler in which Euler’s number magically appears.


The classic #538Riddler from @xaqwg this week demonstrates the value of seeding in time-trial racing: the last team to race boasts almost ten times the win probability of the first, even though the teams are all identical in ability! #riddlernation @ollie pic.twitter.com/8hc1czkChf

0.485 on the Gini Index
New data released by the Census Bureau shows income inequality in the United States has hit its highest level since it first started being tracked in 1967. The U.S. started at 0.397 in 1967 on the Gini index — a measurement of wealth distribution across a population using a scale of zero to one, with one representing total inequality — but last year, it rose to 0.485. Experts attribute the growing gap to wealthy earners seeing much more income growth, and the federal minimum wage staying at $7.25 for more than a decade. [Washington Post]
42 percent
As the U.S. population continues to age rapidly, older Asian Americans are struggling to find appropriate long-term care in their homes — many because of lower financial resources. Research from the National Asian Pacific Center on Aging found that 42 percent of Asian Pacific Islanders provide care to older adults compared to 22 percent of the general population, and that almost 12 percent of Asian Americans, ages 65 and older, were either at or below the poverty level. [NBC News]
1 in 2 senior executives
Data from WarnerMedia’s first diversity and inclusion report shows that in 2018, half of the people hired or promoted at the vice-president level or higher in the company’s global workforce were women. The company was also very close to reaching gender parity for its total workforce (46 percent) for 2018. While people of color make up 38 percent of the company’s total workforce in the U.S., the numbers drop to 24 percent on screen for WarnerMedia’s scripted television shows, and 16 percent of Warner Bros.’ movies. [Deadline]
90,000 Canadian physicians
A growth of the number of physicians in Canada, 12.5 percent between 2014 and 2018 compared to 4.6 percent in the general population, has led to the highest number of doctors per capita, according to a report the Canadian Institute of Health Information. The report says there were nearly 90,000 physicians in the country in 2018, but 2016 data from Statistics Canada still showed approximately 4.8 million people didn’t have a regular health care provider. The report also showed more women entering the medical field, with the number of female doctors increasing by 21 percent since 2014, compared to a rise of seven percent among male doctors.

Blink-182
Tom DeLonge, the former singer and guitarist of the very popular pop-punk band Blink-182, is back in the news after the United States Navy recently confirmed three videos DeLonge and his company published in 2017 and 2018 of mysterious flying objects from 2004 and 2015 were real and showed “unidentified aerial phenomena.” DeLonge is the co-founder of a UFO research organization called To the Stars Academy of Arts & Sciences, which promotes “society’s understanding of scientific phenomena through the lenses of entertainment, science and aerospace.” [New York Times]

The popularity of Chilean-based airline LATAM, Latin America’s biggest airline, has heated up after Delta Air Lines spent $1.9 billion in existing cash and new debt for a 20 percent stake after its rival American Airlines had pursued a joint-venture with the company in the region. Delta, which has a nine percent stake in the Brazilian carrier Gol, said it sell its shares following the purchase. Regulators in the United States and Chile still need to approve the deal. [CNBC]

8 years old
The 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg made headlines for her speech at the UN Climate Summit, but she is also among a group of children and teens, who are now being overwhelmed with online abuse for their climate activism. Tactics include being swarmed with pornography, racist messages, creepy direct messages, barrages of insults, doxing, and death threats. Havana Chapman-Edwards, who is 8-years-old and black, was even contacted by someone her family later discovered was a registered sex offender. [BuzzFeed News]
4,921 sponsored ads from hate groups
A new report says Facebook, the social media website associated with massive amounts of misinformation as much as with baby pictures from your college friends, has made $1.6 million from 4,921 sponsored advertisements from 38 different hate groups and individuals identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center since May 2018. Between May of last year and September 17, 2019, anti-immigrant groups spent $958,988 on Facebook advertisements, and anti-LGBTQ groups spent $541,977. The three largest groups behind the targeted ad spending were the Federation for American Immigration Reform, the Alliance Defending Freedom, and the Family Research Council.[Sludge]
11 percent
Data analysis from art market information company Artnet shows that only 11 percent of the art acquired by 26 top museums in the United States in the last decade were works by women. Between 2008 and 2018, only 29,247 works by female artists were acquired by institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, or the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, out of 260,470 total works. The data also showed the peak number of acquisitions by female artists occurred in 2009, with 3,462, and the gender percentage was “relatively stagnant” over the last 10 years. [New York Times]
5.6-magnitude
An earthquake in northern Pakistan has killed at least 22 people, and injured more than 700. The epicentre of the 5.6-magnitude earthquake that struck on Tuesday afternoon was near the city of Mirpur, where several houses, roads and buildings were damaged. In October 2005, the same region was hit with magnitude 7.6 earthquake that killed more than 75,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. [New York Times]
$343 million
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says the state has distributed half of a $343 million federal grant for members of the citrus industry which suffered damage from Hurricane Irma in September 2017. Growers posted 75-year production lows after the hurricane, and the Florida-specific grant was part of a larger $2.36 billion disaster relief package approved by Congress, but DeSantis said the state had only paid out less than $500,000 when he took office. A study from the Florida Department of Citrus and the University of Florida found the industry supports approximately 50,000 jobs and has a $7.2 billion economic impact. [Orlando Sentinel]
1,009 American CEOs
The CEOs of eBay, Juul, and WeWork have all stepped down this week, but data from business and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas show a record-pace of executive edits among U.S. companies, with 159 CEO changes in August and 1,009 departures for the first eight months of this year. Other companies that saw turnover of their chief executives this month are Comscore, Volkswagen, and Nissan. Experts and analysts says increased accountability from corporate boards, concerns over a economic downturn, as well as the age of baby boomer executives are all factors for this trend. [CNBC]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-this-is-trumps-best-case-the-ukraine-scandal-is-looking-really-bad-for-him/,2019-09-26,,,features,"Sep. 25, 2019","If This Is Trump’s Best Case, The Ukraine Scandal Is Looking Really Bad For Him",Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,Impeachment,"Sometimes, when a news story is still unfolding in real time, we can’t do much better than to hazard a guess about how it will affect the polls. Of course, we can also not hazard a guess — that is, we can not say anything about it at all. But given that I wrote yesterday about public opinion surrounding the impeachment of President Trump, this is one time when I think it’s worth weighing in on the latest development; namely, the White House’s decision to release, on Wednesday, Trump’s reconstructed conversation (note: not a verbatim transcript) with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.
This conversation seems to have triggered a nearly Yanny or Laurel-like reaction in my Twitter feed, almost as though people are seeing and hearing two different things. Everyone either seems to think it’s either really bad for Trump, or not very damaging at all, with few people landing in between.
And I’m not that rare person who hears it both ways. No. I’m on the side that says it’s bad for Trump. And like the Yanny or Laurel thing or The Dress, I have trouble seeing how people see it any other way.
But I’d also say you shouldn’t take that guess very seriously. Our track record when using statistical models is pretty darn good, but when I’m in guess mode, I don’t claim to be much better than a replacement-level pundit.
With that said, there is a little bit of polling data that points in the bad-for-Trump direction (more about that in a moment). And for the record, this is relatively new territory for me. Up until now, I’ve been skeptical of the political wisdom of impeachment for Democrats, as yesterday’s post detailed.
The logic behind my this-is-bad-for-Trump guess is that the White House’s record of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky represents the best–case scenario for Trump. And that best-case scenario is still potentially fairly bad for him. They have Trump on record as imploring a foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden, one of his most likely opponents in the 2020 general election.
The White House’s spin is that the conversation is exculpatory because it doesn’t contain a “quid pro quo” — that is, a direct and explicit threat to Zelensky or a direct and explicit promise to him — in exchange for turning the screws on Biden. The problem for the White House is that its spin presumes three things to be true, all of which seem debatable:
First, it presumes that the public actually cares about the quid pro quo, rather than viewing Trump telling a foreign leader to investigate a political rival as a prima facie abuse of presidential powers. Or, to use a term that Trump wouldn’t like, the public might see it as prima facie evidence of “collusion” between Trump and a foreign power that aims to influence the election — the sort of direct evidence that was lacking in the Mueller report.
Second, the White House line presumes that the public won’t see the White House’s record of the conversation as containing a quid pro quo. But there are plenty of readings by which it does. In the conversation, Trump directly invokes the idea of “reciprocity” between the United States and Ukraine. He says “we do a lot for Ukraine …. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time.” Zelensky also discusses the purchase of Javelin missiles from the U.S. All of this comes before two fairly direct requests — Trump calls the first one a “favor” — that Trump makes of Zelensky, one concerning a cybersecurity firm called CrowdStrike and the other concerning Biden.
Third, it presumes that there won’t be more evidence of a quid pro quo that emerges later on. Given how rapidly the story is developing, that doesn’t seem like a safe bet, either.
You might object that the public won’t care so much about the technical details here. But that potentially cuts both ways. The public could view the quid pro quo part to be a technicality and see Trump’s “favors”/demands/requests of Zelensky to be the nut of the story.
And keep in mind that Trump has more to lose than to gain when it comes to public opinion on impeachment. Until now, a fairly sizable number of voters — somewhere around 15 percent of the electorate — has both disapproved of Trump and disapproved of efforts to impeach him. If the hardcore Trump partisans are the only ones who believe the White House’s spin, his impeachment numbers would get worse, although his approval ratings might not.
As far as polling evidence for how the public feels about Ukraine, there isn’t much of it, but there is some, and it isn’t great for Trump. A YouGov poll on Tuesday asked voters how they’d feel about impeachment if Trump “suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivize the country’s officials to investigate his political rival”; 55 percent of voters supported impeachment in that case, 26 percent opposed it. The problem is that, so far, the delay in military aid has not been proven to be related to Trump’s requests of Zelensky on Biden.1 We don’t know how much that matters to the American public. Hopefully, pollsters will ask voters different versions of questions about impeachment over Ukraine that can test the importance of the quid pro quo. Meanwhile, polling from Reuters/Ipsos suggests that while relatively few Americans knew much about the Ukraine scandal before today, those who had heard of it were more supportive of impeachment.
That’s all we’ve really got to work with, for now. We will, of course, track the polls in the upcoming days.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-2020-candidates-are-running-the-most-tv-ads/,2019-09-26,,,features,"Sep. 26, 2019",Which 2020 Candidates Are Running The Most TV Ads?,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"The average (non-FiveThirtyEight-reading) American’s main exposure to political campaigns probably comes from TV. Since the days of Dwight Eisenhower, television ads have been a central part of our elections; by 2016, campaigns and organizations were spending $2.4 billion to put a total of 3.3 million broadcast TV ads in front of Americans’ bloodshot eyes. These ads can stir up viewers’ emotions, educate low-information voters, manipulate attitudes on race and gender, and — however modestly — persuade voters and win elections.
In short, they are important enough that — along with national polls, state polls, endorsements and fundraising — FiveThirtyEight is now tracking television advertising data for the 2020 presidential election. Our newest elections tool, which uses data from Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group, lets you watch every ad that a 2020 candidate has aired on national cable or in any broadcast media market in the country. For each ad, we also have data on how many times it played, the dates and states where it aired, and how much a campaign or group spent to broadcast it. You can also filter the ads to see only those paid for by a specific candidate, those that aired in a specific state1 or those that deal with a specific issue, such as health care or guns.
Despite the hit our productivity might take if we get sucked into a political-ad-watching black hole, we’re excited about this data’s potential to help us understand the 2020 campaign from yet another angle. Which Democratic primary candidates are going all in on which early states? Now their television ad-buying patterns can give us another clue. What issues are driving the conversation of the campaign? These TV ads will show us not only what candidates are talking about, but also how they are talking about it — what stances they take, what framing they use, and so on.
The ads also tell us something in aggregate, like when individual candidates are making their move and how the campaign overall ebbs and flows.
So far, TV is telling a simple tale. Up until July, the airwaves were pretty quiet. Then philanthropist Tom Steyer jumped into the race. Saying he planned to spend $100 million of his own money on his campaign, he has aired at least 1,000 spots per week ever since, dwarfing the volume put out by other candidates. As of Sept. 26, Steyer had accounted for $12.0 million of the estimated $15.4 million that had been spent on TV ads in the presidential race.
Steyer has been focusing his ads on the first four states to vote in the Democratic primary: He’s aired 15,095 spots in Iowa, 4,588 spots in New Hampshire and Massachusetts (the Boston media market also covers much of New Hampshire), 6,943 spots in Nevada and 10,442 spots in South Carolina.2 And this campaign strategy appears to have paid off, as he does better in early-state polls than he does nationally. For example, according to Morning Consult’s latest weekly tracking poll of the Democratic primary, Steyer has 6 percent support across the four early states but just 1 percent support nationwide. And all seven of his qualifying polls for the October debate (those in which he got 2 percent support or higher) are from early states as well. Arguably, Steyer has his aggressive TV strategy to thank for making the debate stage.
The other candidates have not yet started seriously spending on TV. To date, most candidates have been committed more resources to Facebook and Google ads than to television ads (Pete Buttigieg, for example, has spent $5.3 million on digital vs. just $302,200 on TV). After Steyer, the active candidate who has spent the most on TV is Joe Biden, who has aired 882 spots for an estimated $384,220, almost all of it in Iowa.3
But that’s likely to change. In the 2016 cycle, campaign spending really started to ramp up in fall 2015; the same pattern could emerge this cycle too. Just this week, in fact, Elizabeth Warren announced plans for a $10+ million TV and digital ad blitz in the early states. So keep an eye on our tracker, which is updated every weekday, to see the television primary evolve in real time.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/college-football-is-the-true-home-of-the-play-action-pass/,2019-09-26,,,features,"Sep. 26, 2019",College Football Is The True Home Of The Play-Action Pass,Josh Planos,FiveThirtyEight,College Football,"Kyler Murray’s lone college season as a starting quarterback was, in a word, overwhelming. Here was a would-be professional baseball player operating at warp speed, casually wrecking defensive coverages and sending opposing fans into Surrender Cobra mode before the fourth quarter had even started. There has perhaps never been a QB more preternaturally gifted at making everyone around him seem slow. Murray scored 54 total touchdowns, compiled the highest Total QBR recorded1 and led the Oklahoma Sooners to a conference championship and a berth in the College Football Playoff. In the words of his coach, Lincoln Riley, the Heisman winner was responsible for “the greatest single season in the history of college football.”
Maybe Murray would have made history even if he were running, say, the wishbone at a military academy. But he operated within Riley’s Air Raid-hued scheme, which seems to annually hatch the most devastating offense in the modern era. He spearheaded a souped-up offense adept at creating space and leveraging a passing attack to score a ridiculous number of points.
Murray has since moved on to the NFL, but one of the Sooners’ fundamental concepts, the play-action pass, continues to saturate the sport. Since Riley was elevated to head coach in 2017, no team from a Power Five conference has relied more on play-action (37.6 percent of team dropbacks). Moreover, no program has gained more yards (5,445) or scored more touchdowns (59) when running it.
Pro offensive coordinators often draw creativity from their college counterparts, so it should come as no surprise that nearly the entire NFL lined up last year to pick Riley’s brain. My colleague Josh Hermsmeyer has written extensively about the impact of play-action in the NFL. But in terms of volume, the college game is even more reliant on fake handoffs.

At its root, play-action is a con. It forces an opponent to honor the threat of choice and lures defenders out of position.2 By forcing pass rushers to respect a potential designed run — and drawing linebackers toward the line of scrimmage while ceding the middle of the field — QBs are handed enormous passing lanes through which to dissect a defense.
As college football’s regular season marches into its second month, more than one-quarter of dropbacks at the Power Five level have involved play-action. That’s the second-highest mark since at least 2011, and if maintained it will represent a second consecutive season of increased play-action frequency. Fifteen teams are using play-action on at least 35 percent of dropbacks, with Florida State, Louisville, Kansas State and Florida eclipsing 40 percent.
The reason for the increase in volume is clear: Play-action is extremely effective.
“If you’re not a tight end-fullback running team, you’re in a spread, you’re trying to play-action pass and trying to flow it down the field,” Oklahoma State head coach Mike Gundy said at Big 12 Media Days this summer.
Over each of the past eight years, through the fourth game of the season, the average Power Five quarterback’s play-action QBR has been considerably higher than his Total QBR in each season. In 2019, there’s a gap of more than 10 points.

Of the 10 Power Five teams that use play-action the least, half rank in the bottom quartile of all 65 Power Five teams in offensive efficiency. Alabama ranks second in offensive efficiency this season and has manufactured 53.3 expected points added with play-action, the fourth-highest total through four games by any Power Five team since at least 2011. No surprise that Crimson Tide offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian referred to play-action as “a quarterback’s best friend.”
And because of those available passing lanes, quarterbacks are frequently given the green light to attack the second level of a defense. A quarterback’s air yards per attempt3 jump 50 percent, from 8.8 without to 13.1 with play-action.
Those throws are typically right on the money, too. Power Five quarterbacks posted a higher adjusted completion percentage in each of the past eight seasons when play-action was called versus any other play type that involved a throw, a nearly 2-point improvement (66.5 to 68.2 percent).
The call also seldom comes at the expense of turnovers. The average Power Five QB sees the same number of interceptions thrown per pass attempt with or without faking a handoff prior to the throw (2.9 percent). And as Hermsmeyer and Ben Baldwin have reported, an offense doesn’t even require a potent rushing attack for play-action to prove fruitful.
Not only is play-action volume up, but so too is its value. The average Power Five team is producing 3.2 expected points added via play-action, a 33 percent increase since 2011. Alabama, Iowa State and Oklahoma are each scoring more than 15 points per contest via play-action this season, figures that, if maintained, would all break the single-season record for the metric.
It seems that demonstrating an ability to successfully run a play-action-influenced offense increasingly leads to professional opportunities. Of the quarterbacks who posted the 10 best individual seasons since 2011 (in terms of play-action touchdowns accounted for), five are currently starting in the NFL.4
Oklahoma’s 2018 highlight reel is a supercut of Murray eviscerating the opposition on play-action, and that system continues to flourish in 2019. The value of the running back depreciates by the snap as bell cows increasingly are seen for what they are: a distraction from the main entree. Running play-action alone doesn’t guarantee success,5 but in an era defined by scoring, the option to turn to one of the most effective means of procuring points would seem an obvious one. College coaches have taken note.

The Cubs Don’t. Which Team Is Going To The Playoffs?,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"Nearly three years ago on a rainy November night in Cleveland, it seemed as though the Chicago Cubs were poised to begin a dynasty. But that promise is gone. The Cubs had an optimistic 69 percent playoff probability on Sept. 17, but a four-game sweep at the hands of their archrivals, the St. Louis Cardinals, all but ended their hopes, and they were eliminated from postseason contention on Wednesday night. And as the Cubs collapse, the Cardinals are headed back to the postseason for the first time since 2015.
While Cubs manager Joe Maddon is oft-cited as a possible culprit, he is a useful scapegoat: There is plenty of blame to be shared. And perhaps the most consequential area separating the Cubs and Cardinals is pitching. No team has been more productive in drafting pitchers than the Cardinals have been since 2012 — and few clubs have been worse than the Cubs.
Since Theo Epstein was hired to lead the Cubs baseball operations in October 2011, the Cardinals’ drafts lead baseball in pitching wins above replacement produced (29.2 WAR from 117 pitchers drafted and signed), while the Cubs rank 25th (2.2 WAR from 105 pitchers drafted and signed), according to Baseball-Reference.com data analyzed by FiveThirtyEight.1

A significant part of the Cubs’ rebuilding strategy was to use their premium picks, the spoils of tanking, on position player prospects — and then fill in pitching gaps via free agency with their big-market dollars and through trades. But Chicago produced zero pitching WAR — or worse — to date from six of the seven drafts from 2012 to 2018, placing substantial pressure on the organization to fill the voids externally. Free agency is an inherently risky vehicle to improve a team, especially as players are getting younger, and the Cubs have the oldest collection of pitchers in the majors with an average age of 31.1 years.
No club has spent more payroll dollars on pitching this year than the Cubs ($128.4 million), and with a modest return from that investment: The Cubs are just 11th in wins above replacement from pitchers. External additions of Yu Darvish, Craig Kimbrel, Cole Hamels and Tyler Chatwood each have pedestrian fielding-independent pitching marks; none has a mark better than 4.18 on the season. Epstein’s quest to “find pitching,” words he scrawled on an office white board in 2016, has also cost the Cubs treasured prospects in Gleyber Torres2 and Eloy Jimenez.3
Today’s model organizations don’t just tank to successfully rebuild (see the Houston Astros) — and many don’t even have to tank (see the Yankees, Rays and Dodgers). They’re creating draft-and-develop success stories. Those clubs have proven that they can draft well without having to pick near the top of the draft, and they can get more out of the big-league pitchers they acquire, like Houston has done with Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole.
The Cardinals, with only one losing season this century, haven’t needed to resort to tanking. They’ve used their drafts to select quality arms — and the value of their homegrown pitching was on display last weekend in Chicago.
On Thursday, Jack Flaherty helped St. Louis to a series-opening win with eight dominant innings. Flaherty — drafted by the Cardinals with the 34th overall pick in 2014 — has emerged as one of the best pitchers in baseball in the second half of the season, owning a 1.00 ERA over his last 15 starts. Michael Wacha, one of the Cardinals’ first-round picks from 2012, started Friday’s game and allowed one run over four innings. Then, rookie Ryan Helsley, a fifth-round pick in the 2015 draft, picked up the win with a scoreless inning in relief. Helsley has a 2.23 ERA through 36 1/3 innings this season. And on Saturday, 2016 first-round pick Dakota Hudson (16-7, 3.45 ERA this season) started a wild back-and-forth affair.
On the other side of that Saturday seesaw was Kimbrel, signed for $43 million in June to help Chicago’s struggling bullpen. With his team up 8-7, Kimbrel came in for the ninth inning and immediately allowed back-to-back home runs — a devastating sequence for the Cubs. Kimbrel owns a 6.53 ERA on the season.
The Cubs are well aware of their homegrown pitching deficiency and have taken steps in recent years to improve their draft-and-development capabilities. Prospect Brailyn Marquez is an early success story. Darvish has been excellent in the second half of this season, though he’s expected to be an ace, given his $126 million contract. But other clubs like the Dodgers, Cardinals and Astros have gotten ahead of, or have been ahead of, the Cubs.
While this group of Cubs will always be remembered for delivering a title, fans may be more focused today on the dynasty that might have been, had they followed the model of the rival Cardinals in drafting and developing pitchers.

Unlike the bans of flavored vaping products in New York and Michigan aimed at reducing the sale to children, the ban in Massachusetts is for all e-cigarettes and supplies used for tobacco and marijuana, which is legal in the state. A study by the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor found the popularity of vaping has risen to one in four 12th-graders and one in 10 8th graders reporting they had vaped a nicotine product in the previous 30 days.

885,000 nonexistent customers
The Federal Communications Commission says Sprint falsely claimed millions in government subsidies for up to 885,000 customers under a federal subsidy program aimed at helping low-income Americans afford cellphone and Internet service. The telecommunications company said regulatory changes to the Lifeline program in 2016 were the reason for the error, and have offered to pay back the government. The Oregon Public Utility Commission was the first to notice the discrepancy and launched an investigation that showed Sprint was counting customers as active, even if they had not used a device in 45 days.

$50 million
Comscore, the company everyone else relied on to tell them web traffic analytics, was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with fraud for juicing its public revenue filings between 2014 and 2016 by $50 million. The SEC says that the analytics company and its former CEO Serge Matta (who left in 2016) misreported its customer numbers and growth percentages, as well as the value of data-swapping contracts. But on Tuesday, Comscore and Matta agreed to settle, and paid financial settlements of $5 million and $700,000, respectively, without having to admit wrongdoing. [The Verge]
43 percent
A new research paper, led by a Duke University economist, found 43 percent of the white applicants accepted to Harvard University between 2009 and 2014 were athletes, the children of alumni, or the children of donors and faculty. The researchers found athletes alone make up over 16 percent of admitted students who are white, and the admission rate for white athletes was 87 percent, compared to 5 percent for applicants who are not athletes. White children of alumni, also known as legacy students, had an admission rate of 34 per cent. [Slate]
360 Adams Street
A series of sidewalk sheds at 360 Adams St, in front of the Brooklyn Supreme Court Building, have been up since 2007, costing the city $4,340 a month in rent to a private contractor. Repairs still need to be made to the building’s facade in accordance with a city law, but a spokesperson from the Department of Design and Construction says construction is not expected to start until 2021. Rental fees for the sidewalk sheds have already totaled more than half a million dollars. [Brooklyn Paper]

Although she and others in House leadership positions have resisted opening formal impeachment proceedings for months, a deluge of new calls from more moderate members of her party may have cemented her decision to move forward.
From ABC News:

More than two-thirds of the Democratic caucus now favor beginning an impeachment investigation in response to allegations that Trump attempted to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, and may have threatened to withhold foreign aid.
This is a huge change from the end of July, when we last checked in on where impeachment stood among House Democrats. At that point, just a few days after special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony before two House committees about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, 109 Democrats were in support of impeachment. Granted, more than half of House Democrats have been in favor of impeachment since early August, but that number has now risen to 179, according to the New York Times,1 which means a solid majority of the Democratic caucus now supports impeachment.
Of course, a lot could depend on how the next few days unfold — in particular, whether the White House turns over the transcript of Trump’s July 25 call with Zelensky or the whistleblower complaint (which the administration has so far refused to share with Congress, despite a subpoena). After all, some moderates have hedged saying they’d support impeachment if the allegations prove true. But if the accusations against Trump are borne out, the remaining Democratic holdouts could face increasing pressure to support the impeachment inquiry — for one thing, Democrats are still short of the 218 votes they need for an impeachment resolution.
So how did we get here? The dramatic uptick in support for impeachment since July is due to two main shifts. First, during the August recess, a steady trickle of Democrats announced their support for impeachment, perhaps in response to pressure from people in their districts. And second, in just the past few days, dozens of Democrats have lined up in support of an impeachment inquiry for the first time, including a significant number from red and purple districts that Clinton either lost or won by 10 points. In fact, more than half of the Democrats who recently joined the pro-impeachment column come from districts that Democrats lost or won by less than 10 percentage points. These are the members who have the most at stake electorally if an impeachment inquiry backfires against Democrats, so their support is especially noteworthy.

This means the base of support for impeachment has become more ideologically diverse. For instance, if we look at the districts where House members now support impeachment, Trump lost these districts in 2016 by around 31 percentage points. But in July, his average loss in these pro-impeachment districts was 38 percentage points, showing that members from more moderate districts have joined the cause. (For reference, Trump lost the average Democratic-held seat by 28 percentage points, and he lost the districts of Democratic members who are currently not supporting impeachment by an average of 18 percentage points.)
And while some moderates have been careful to say their support is conditional on the allegations being true, some potentially vulnerable Democrats seem to be in favor of an impeachment inquiry regardless of what happens next. For example, Rep. Antonio Delgado, who represents a district in upstate New York that Trump won by 7 points in 2016, said that asking the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden was “in itself an impeachable offense.”
The new supporters for impeachment also include a significant number of Democrats from very liberal districts who had previously resisted calls for impeachment. As the table below shows, only 18 Democrats from very liberal districts continue to oppose (or remain undecided/refuse to comment) on impeachment — down significantly from the end of July:

Some recent switchers from the more liberal camp include Georgia civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, a Pelosi ally who called for impeachment proceedings in a dramatic speech on the House floor on Tuesday, and Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, who had previously argued that impeachment would “tear the country apart.” It seems that for many of these Democrats, the gravity and scale of the allegations against Trump finally outweighed concerns about whether an impeachment push without bipartisan support would be too divisive, or if it would be useless to impeach Trump given that Senate Republicans are highly unlikely to vote to remove him from office. (Although there was a flicker of bipartisan energy in the Senate on Tuesday evening, when a nonbinding resolution calling on the Trump administration to release the whistleblower complaint passed unanimously.)
Opposition to impeachment among Democrats from red and blue districts has also fallen over the past few days, but there are still a significant number who do not represent very liberal districts and who haven’t yet endorsed an impeachment inquiry. Of the 64 Democrats from districts that Hillary Clinton won or lost by 10 points or fewer in 2016, more than half now support impeachment. That’s more than twice as many than at the end of July, but a sizeable chunk still haven’t gotten on board. And as the table below shows, many of these Democrats hail from districts that Clinton lost:

Some of these Democrats may remain wary of embracing impeachment — and that could be tricky for House leadership down the road, if they do decide to pursue an impeachment resolution. But the fact that Democrats like Delgado, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, and Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who are all from districts that Trump won by 7 points in 2016, are newly supporting impeachment could embolden other moderates to join them.
Regardless of what happens next, it’s clear that the political ground on impeachment has shifted dramatically among Democrats in a very short period of time. Even Biden, who previously said that impeachment proceedings would be a “giant distraction,” said that the House should move forward with impeachment if the Trump administration refuses to turn over information about the call with the Ukrainian president. And as FiveThirtyEight’s editor in chief, Nate Silver, wrote Tuesday, pursuing impeachment is a big risk for the Democrats, considering how unpopular it remained throughout the course of the Mueller investigation. But for the first time, the vast majority of House Democrats seem willing to take that risk.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

It’s rare that all three newly promoted clubs stay up in the Premier League for more than a season together — it’s only happened twice in the past decade.1
But there’s good news for this year’s three freshly promoted clubs. The average expected goals (xG) per 90 minutes through six games played for teams promoted to the Premier League since 2009-10 is 1.08. And the average xG per 90 minutes for newly promoted teams that stayed in the Premier League beyond their first season is 1.22. Aston Villa, Sheffield and Norwich each has an xG of 1.30. All newly promoted teams since 2009-10 have experienced an uptick of 0.113 xG from their sixth match through the end of the season, suggesting Villa, Norwich and Sheffield each has room to improve.

Despite its above average showing in terms of xG, Villa already finds itself in some peril. The club is currently hanging out with Watford and Wolverhampton Wanderers in the relegation zone, having accumulated just 4 of a possible 18 points after six matches. It’s still early, but recent precedent suggests that Villa could be in trouble.
In the past decade, just two newly promoted clubs have accumulated fewer points than this iteration of Villa through their sixth match and survived their relegation scares.2 The other four clubs to find themselves in similar quandaries3 have all been relegated.
The bad news for Villa is that it’s currently on pace for approximately 25 points, and no club in the Premier League era has avoided relegation with so few points. The good news is that a slow start isn’t always a death sentence for a newly promoted club — and indeed might actually point to good things to come. Southampton grabbed just 3 points through its first six matches in 2012-13 but managed to fend off relegation and cement itself as a perennial Premier League club — the Saints are currently enjoying their eighth consecutive season in the English top flight. And through six matches in 2013-14, Crystal Palace too had secured just 3 points. Like Southampton the season before, Palace recovered from its slow start and is currently in the midst of its seventh consecutive Premier League season. Neither club has challenged for the title, but neither has been forced to grind it out in the Championship — and likely operate at a financial loss while doing so.
Sheffield United and Norwich City have matched Villa in terms of expected goals, but each has accumulated more points, and neither is in the relegation zone — at least not yet. And it’s not all doom and gloom in Birmingham. Villa has managed a win over an Everton team that expects to challenge for the top six and pushed Spurs to the brink on the first weekend of the season. For their part, Sheffield already has a draw with Chelsea and a win over that same hopeful Everton club. And despite giving away the second-most goals per 90 minutes in the Premier League through match day six, Norwich — led by star forward Teemu Pukki — grabbed the most impressive scalp of them all: a win over Pep Guardiola’s mighty Manchester City.
It’s too early to say how any of this will shake out — Norwich will have to figure out its defensive woes if it hopes to survive, to be sure, while Villa will have to start scoring actual goals — but it’s already clear that this season’s crop of newly promoted clubs aren’t there to be stomped on.
Norwich City or Sheffield United quickly being relegated once more would be in line with precedent. Since the formation of the Premier League, those clubs have mostly existed in the lower divisions — gaining the rare promotion to the Premier League and then getting relegated is what they’ve always done.
But Villa — whose relegation in the spring of 2016 shocked the soccer world — is part of the Premier League’s bedrock. At the time, they were one of just seven teams to play in every Premier League season. After a brief — and nearly disastrous — stint away from it, the Villans have reestablished themselves as a club that belongs at the top of the English soccer pyramid. But if they hope to remain there this time, the goals will have to start coming sooner rather than later. Fortunately for Villa fans, the data suggests they will. Even if just barely.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-josh-allen-and-the-buffalo-bills-actually-good/,2019-09-25,,,features,"Sep. 25, 2019",So … Are The Buffalo Bills Actually Good?,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"For just the third time since 1992, the Buffalo Bills have started a season 3-0, after they beat the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday in Orchard Park. The team is currently thriving under second-year quarterback Josh Allen, who has led game-winning drives in two of the Bills’ three games this season. Don’t look now, but the Bills are tied for the 11th-highest Super Bowl probability in the league, according to the FiveThirtyEight model.
Circle the wagons, Buffalo!
But naturally, the Bills are staring at a potential reality check this week, in the form of the also-undefeated New England Patriots. So, in this week’s column, we must ask: Are Allen and the Bills actually good? And will it even matter against the Pats? Let’s dive into the early numbers.
Allen has built on a polarizing rookie season with his play so far in 2019. On the one hand, Allen has won games with a combination of timely passing (he leads all quarterbacks this season in yards compiled during the final five minutes of one-score games) and impressive running (only Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson has more rushing yards among QBs). On the other hand, he ranks just 26th out of 35 qualified QBs in passer rating, with below-average rates of completions, yards, touchdowns and interceptions per attempt. In that regard — winning despite across-the-board mediocre passing numbers — Allen is well on his way to joining a bizarre group that includes Jake Plummer, Trent Dilfer, Kordell Stewart and Mark Sanchez.
Our own quarterback ratings basically split the difference between the good and the bad. With an Elo QB rating of 161, Allen isn’t great, but he’s not terrible either. In fact, he’s almost precisely average — just 4 rating points below the typical NFL starter — and by Buffalo standards, that’s not too shabby. The last time the Bills’ starter had an Elo rating that good relative to average, it was Tyrod Taylor in the middle of the 2017 season. (That happened to be the only year this century that Buffalo made the playoffs.) Compared with QBs from earlier 3-0 Bills starts, Allen is no Jim Kelly or even Ryan Fitzpatrick, but he is better than Trent Edwards was back in early 2008:

Those 2008 Bills would beat the Rams in Week 4 to run their record to 4-0 … before closing the year on a 3-9 skid to finish out of the playoffs. The 2011 Bills also fizzled after a promising first two months — which included a rare win over New England — losing seven straight and eight of their final nine games to waste a 5-2 start. So Buffalo has been tantalized by fast starts before, only to fall flat later on. But all the Kelly-led Bills on the list above went to the AFC championship game, and two of them went to the Super Bowl.
Fine — Allen and Kelly, his Hall of Fame predecessor, still have little in common aside from the charging bison on their helmets. But Allen has at least shown some hints of improvement as a passer so far in his second pro season. Despite his still-mediocre overall numbers, Allen has been more accurate this year, cutting his rate of “poor throws” (according to Pro-Football-Reference.com) from a league-worst 24 percent in 2018 to just 6 percent — which ranks fourth-best this year. Some of that can be attributed to a dose of shorter throws,1 but the NFL’s Next Gen Stats estimate that Allen is completing passes at a rate 0.9 percentage points higher than expected this season, even after adjusting for the depth of the pass and other particulars, while he checked in at 7.7 percentage points below expected last season (second-worst in the league).

So Allen may be getting better with his arm while remaining a threat with his legs. And as a team, Buffalo ranks ninth in total expected points added (EPA) per game so far this season, including 10th in special teams EPA, eighth in defensive EPA and sixth in defense against the pass specifically. ProFootballFocus grades safeties Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer both as among the top 10 in the league at the position this season, two of 10 total Bills defenders who rank among the top 50 at their respective positions per PFF (and four who rank among the top 25). Last year’s Bills had one of the best EPA defenses in football as well, but they were undone by poor passing offense and special teams; if this year’s team has improved in those regards, Buffalo could have surprising staying power.
Of course, the Bills have also played one of the easiest schedules in the NFL so far. The Jets, Giants and Bengals collectively had an average pregame Elo rating of 1415 going into their contests against Buffalo; only the Cowboys, whose opponents have averaged a pregame rating of 1392, have played a softer group of creampuffs this season. And now, here come the Patriots — the second-highest-ranked team in our Elo ratings. New England’s current rating of 1686 is the 13th-highest the Pats have ever had coming into a game against the Bills in the history of the rivalry. (If you can call it that — New England has won five straight and 33 of the past 37 meetings dating back to 2000.) The Pats’ defense hasn’t allowed a touchdown since last year’s AFC title game, and some folks are already talking about the possibility of another undefeated season in Foxboro.
So let’s be honest: A lot of signs point to the Bills’ magical season-opening run coming to a screeching halt against New England this week. (Our model gives the Pats a 65 percent chance of winning, despite being on the road, and that’s conservative compared with the probability implied by the Vegas line.) But we also give Buffalo a 70 percent chance to make the playoffs — and for a franchise with only one playoff game under its belt since 1999, that’s as good an excuse for a raucous parking-lot celebration as anything else.
Looking Ahead: Week 4
Best matchup: No. 4 Dallas (-1) at No. 14 New Orleans, 8:20 p.m. ET Sunday
Matchup quality: 85th percentile2Matchup evenness: 89th percentile
As we wrote about in an earlier edition of the column, Dak Prescott of the Cowboys has been one of 2019’s breakout quarterbacks: According to our Elo QB value metric, only Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes has been better on a per-game basis than Prescott this season. Now he’ll take Dallas and its 3-0 record into New Orleans to face Teddy Bridgewater and the Saints in our top game of the week. All things considered, Bridgewater was fine in his first game as Drew Brees’s stand-in, grading 73 Elo points better than average against the Seahawks last week — though he still ranks 25th among current starters in our QB rankings. New Orleans will probably rely heavily on Alvin Kamara again after the running back racked up 161 scrimmage yards versus Seattle, but our model gives the Cowboys a slight edge (53 percent chance of winning) on the road.
See also: Minnesota at Chicago (80th/70th); Philadelphia at Green Bay (85th/62nd).
Biggest playoff implications: No. 11 Minnesota at No. 7 Chicago (-2.5), 4:25 p.m. ET Sunday
Potential shift in playoff odds: 29.4 total percentage points
The NFC North has turned into a surprisingly strong division, with every team featuring an above-.500 record at the moment. That’s a good recipe for crucial early-season divisional matchups, and no Week 4 game is more important than Sunday’s showdown between the Vikings and the Bears. Minnesota rebounded from a tough loss to the Packers with a convincing win over the Raiders last week; Chicago finally got a good game out of Mitchell Trubisky en route to a Monday night romp over Washington. The winner of Bears-Vikings will see its playoff odds rise to over 50 percent, but the loser will drop into the 20-to-25 percent range. We give Chicago a 59 percent chance of coming out on top.

Home teams are in bold.
The scoring system is nonlinear, so readers’ average points don’t necessarily match the number of points that would be given to the average reader prediction.
Week 3 was a victorious one for the readers! The average FiveThirtyEight picker beat our Elo model by 1 point this time around, giving the field its first win of the season. While Elo shrewdly took the Colts over the Falcons and had its faith in the 49ers and Bills rewarded, the readers picked up big points shading the Cardinals, Chargers, Titans and Bucs, all of whom eventually lost. Interestingly, the readers and the computer agreed on the favorite in all but one game last week (that Colts-Falcons game), but the human prognosticators won with smart probabilistic thinking. Nice job, all!
Among individual readers, congrats to Bruce C, who led all (identified) readers in Week 3 with 170.9 points, and to Matt Melchior, whose total of 407.0 points leads the full-season contest. Thanks to everyone who played — and if you haven’t, be sure to get in on the action! You can make picks now and try your luck against Elo, even if you missed Week 3.

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): On Wednesday morning we got the latest big development in the still-developing Ukraine story. First there was news of a whistleblower complaint alleging that President Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced plans to open an official impeachment inquiry of the president. And today, the White House released a summary of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky.
At this stage, there’s still a lot we don’t know. We don’t have the full whistleblower complaint (although it is expected to be released this week and the whistleblower may even testify before Congress). And testimony is also expected from acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire tomorrow on the whistleblower’s report. So, again, there are still a lot of moving parts. But let’s take stock of where things stand now that we have the White House’s summary of the phone call:
How bad is this for Trump?
Does the impeachment inquiry announced by Pelosi on Tuesday continue to build?
How have elected Republicans reacted, particularly in the U.S. Senate?
No. 1 first: How bad was the summary for Trump?
micah (Micah Cohen, managing editor): Bad?
Actually, I think the real answer is … “Very, very bad?” And the verys are important there, but so is the question mark.
ameliatd (Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, senior writer): It’s bad — especially because we haven’t yet seen the whistleblower complaint, which apparently has multiple incidents, not just this call. That is — it’s especially bad if this is the least-bad thing that could have come out.
clare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): This definitely has a lot of momentum — it’s a big deal, even if it doesn’t change a lot of the mechanics of what’s already being done in the House to investigate the president.
And yes, it doesn’t look great for Trump whatsoever.
ameliatd: And the whistleblower is apparently willing to testify, so we’re presumably going to get more information about the circumstances around the call.
The Trump talking point is that there was no explicit quid pro quo, but the call is extremely suggestive. In the summary, Trump starts by talking about aid to Ukraine, then pivots to asking for a “favor.”
And if this was part of a larger pattern where the aid is more explicitly connected to Trump’s requests, that would be really, really bad. That’s what remains to be seen — what made the whistleblower file the report? It wasn’t just this call.
clare.malone: Right, as people have pointed out, this call summary is just one component of a larger report.
So, if this is the part that the White House was comfortable making public, it does lead one to wonder what the part they wanted to suppress has in it.
sarahf: Yeah, and this was something Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen made clear in his testimony before Congress — this is part of how Trump operates. He doesn’t ask for people to outright commit a crime or lie, but he does make it clear what he wants “in his way.”
I guess I’m just unconvinced that this will shift opinions among those who already support the president (or independents).
clare.malone: Well, Sarah, I guess I would agree with you that it probably won’t change the views of his most dyed-in-the-wool supporters, but it could definitely shake the confidence of voters on the fence about him.
Which is the reason why Democrats from moderate districts apparently seem to feel so comfortable coming out in support of impeachment. I think this case (Ukraine) is much more clearly understood by people to be … shady … than the Mueller situation was.
ameliatd: I agree with you on that, Clare. As someone who spent a lot of time explaining the ins and outs of everything Mueller was investigating (and what he found), Ukraine appears to be a much clearer story — even without evidence of explicit quid pro quo.
micah: Well, this sorta gets at what I think is a central question now … politically, at least. We already know that voters have a high bar for impeachment. Will asking a foreign leader to investigate his most likely 2020 opponent clear that bar? Or will voters want evidence of an explicit quid pro quo?
The White House is very clearly trying to draw the conversation around a clear quid pro quo.
Which makes sense — as the call summary already proves Trump asked for the investigation, I’m not sure what other options they have.
clare.malone: Right, and one thing I think we should mention is that the call summary potentially leaves a lot out:


The biggest clue that the Ukraine conversation has been condensed is on the first page: It's a 30 min convo that's been conveyed in just five pages. pic.twitter.com/Ge2WDMJzEv
— Annie Linskey (@AnnieLinskey) September 25, 2019

Per this tweet, the conversation was 30 minutes and the words in the summary don’t necessarily compute with a normally-paced 30 minute call.
ameliatd: Some people are also pointing out the ellipses in the summary, Clare, which are concentrated in the sections where Trump’s talking about what he wants Zelensky to investigate.
micah: Does the fact that the White House is trying to draw the line at quid pro quo make you think there won’t be evidence of that? Or is it just that that’s kinda their only avenue left on this story?
I guess … who knows!?!?!
🤷‍♂️
ameliatd: I wouldn’t be surprised if there was no explicit quid pro quo, just because as Sarah says, that doesn’t seem to be how Trump operates. At least, explicit quid pro quo in the sense of Trump saying, “Kiss your aid from us goodbye unless you investigate the Bidens.”
sarahf: But given that conversations aren’t recorded in the Oval office anymore (thanks, Nixon!) … won’t there always be a question of what was said (or wasn’t said) hanging over the conversation?
micah: Unless … Ukraine made a recording!!!
IDK, even in that call summary there wasn’t a lot of dancing or insinuating!
That’s kinda where I shake out on all this for now in terms of Trump’s political risk: If the call summary represents the lower bound, there’s a LOT of risk to the president.
sarahf: I still think though that there’s a possibility that some dismiss this as, “It sounded like the president,” à la Sen. Shelley Moore Capito here.
ameliatd: Also, Zelensky actually seemed pretty willing on the call to investigate — he talked about his new prosecutor and then told Trump, “He or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.” Not sure if/how that changes things, or if he was just saying what he thought Trump wanted to hear, but I wonder if that’s another place where additional context will help clarify.
clare.malone: Though, to that point, Amelia, we have this report:


“[Sen.] Murphy…said Monday that the Ukrainian president ‘directly’ expressed concerns at their meeting that ‘the aid that was being cut off to Ukraine by the president was a consequence’ of his unwillingness to launch an investigation into the Bidens.” https://t.co/p7LPuEO1Jq
— Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) September 24, 2019

sarahf: But OK, let’s talk about the *risk* for the president that this all poses. According to the New York Times, 208 Democrats (as of midday Wednesday) support opening an impeachment inquiry. That represents a dramatic uptick in members supporting this move — Democrats need only 218 to actually open a motion.
Do we think that comes next?
Or what are Democrats’ next move?
micah: Just to start, it seems like Democrats will be pretty unified around the impeachment inquiry. I’ve seen some agita around keeping the inquiry focused on Ukraine — rather than folding in other potential transgressions — but I think we can expect the vast majority of Democrats to stay in line. As you said, Sarah, that was the big shift over the last week.
In terms of what comes next …
clare.malone: Testimony from the whistleblower could be really powerful.
ameliatd: Yeah, Democrats will want the whistleblower to testify. And they’ll probably also subpoena Rudy Giuliani, given that he’s all over this call.
The benefit of formally opening an impeachment proceeding is that it gives the House a much stronger legal position in getting documents and testimony.
clare.malone: Yeah, this is a real battle of governmental branches right here!
I bet high school civics teachers are losing their shit this week with the real life examples.
micah: Lots of juicy Constitutional questions!
Anyway, I do think it’ll be crucial to watch how focused Democrats can keep things on this Ukraine story.
If the public thinks Democrats are just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks, public opinion probably won’t move much. And Democrats need public opinion to move.
clare.malone: I wonder how much they will be chased by the ghosts of that letter from Attorney General William Barr, the Mueller testimony, etc. Perhaps they’ve learned lessons about how to keep the public focused on the aspects of the narrative that are most beneficial to their impeachment case.
Because as we’ve said before, impeachment is a political act, above all. It’s not frippery to say that the Democrats need to maintain a strong narrative for the public to glom onto. It’s not a lofty thing to say, but a lot of this is PR.
micah: Yeah, to stay on public opinion for a sec …
This is from Nate’s piece yesterday:
Heretofore, quite a lot of voters have both disapproved of Trump’s conduct and disapproved of impeaching him.
Why this gap has persisted isn’t entirely clear. Pelosi’s reluctance on impeachment undoubtedly dissuaded some Democratic voters from getting on board; the most recent Quinnipiac poll found only 61 percent of Democrats in favor of impeachment and 29 percent opposed. Those numbers may increase now that House leadership is coming around to impeachment.
The same poll, however, found independent voters mostly against impeachment — 62 percent opposed it to 28 percent in favor. That’s despite Trump having only a 35 percent approval rating among independents in the poll. So impeachment has given Democrats problems among swing voters as well.
So that, to me, is something to watch:
Do Democrats now rally behind impeachment? (Probably?)
Do Independents move towards impeachment? (🤷‍♂️)
sarahf: And on the subject of public opinion, this poll dropped after we published Nate’s piece yesterday, but a new Quinnipiac poll that was in the field from Sept 19-23, captured a 5 percentage point shift in favor of impeachment since it last asked the question in July.

							micah: Yeah, there’s some Democratic movement towards impeachment — support among Democrats jumped 12 points, from 61 percent in the Quinnipiac poll Nate referenced (which was the most recent when he wrote that article) to 73 percent now.
And I think that’s where most of the overall shift comes from right now. Support for impeachment among independents crept up 6 points, from 28 percent to 34 percent.
ameliatd: That’s why I think the hearings and testimony that unfold over the next few days/weeks are so, so key. I generally think the comparisons to Watergate wear kind of thin, but public hearings and testimony were crucially important in building the case against Nixon. And the Democrats have basically gotten none of that so far because the Trump administration has so successfully stonewalled them.
sarahf: Which brings me to our third point — for some of the public opinion shift we’re talking about to happen — you need more than just Democrats and independents to say they support impeaching Trump, right?
Because ultimately, we’ve got a divided Congress, which means even if the House votes to open an impeachment inquiry and even passes articles of impeachment, it would still likely die in the Republican-controlled Senate, hurting Democrats’ ability to control some of this narrative, no?
clare.malone: I suppose you need the on-the-bubble Republican voter to find this whole thing distasteful.
Ye olde Reluctant Trump Voter.
sarahf: So far on the GOP side, only Sen. Mitt Romney has spoken out against Trump on the Ukraine story.
No GOP member of the House currently supports an impeachment inquiry. (Although on Tuesday, the Senate did unanimously pass a nonbinding resolution calling on the Trump administration to release the whistleblower complaint — so there’s still the possibility more Republicans come forward.)
micah: But I don’t think it’s particularly telling that elected Republicans are sticking with Trump in the wake of this.
Wherever the goal posts are on this story — asking a foreign leader to interfere in a U.S. election, quid pro quo, etc. — you’d expect Republicans to use the most pro-Trump ones …
Especially in the early days.
clare.malone: Yep. It’s very hard to imagine this Republican Senate, in particular, turning against Trump.
Though, here’s what Sen. Susan Collins has said, FWIW


Susan Collins says the Trump call summary/transcript “raises a number of important questions”
— Igor Bobic (@igorbobic) September 25, 2019

micah: I mean, that’s pretty weak sauce from Collins.
clare.malone: She, of course, is in her own predicament as an endangered more-moderate member.
micah: Yeah, she’ll be interesting to watch as she’s in a tough re-election fight.
But on the question of if and how Republicans start to move against Trump, I thought this was really smart from FiveThirtyEight contributor Lee Drutman:
If you’ve ever been at a dinner party, you’ll understand the following dynamic: It’s late. The conversation is deadly dull. Dessert still hasn’t been served. You’re bored and exhausted and want nothing more than to go home and go to bed. But you don’t want to be the first person to leave.Eventually, somebody decides it’s grown late enough. She makes an excuse to leave. Now there’s safety in numbers. You can leave because other people are leaving. And the dinner party ends. Suddenly.
ameliatd: I do wonder what it would take to get more than your standard “this-is-troubling-I-have-questions” response from congressional Republicans. Does someone like Romney have to go out on a limb to give other people cover?
micah: Amelia, I think Lee’s article speaks to that:
The insight here borrows from political scientist Timur Kuran’s classic work Private Truth, Public Lies: The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification. The logic is straightforward: In social and political situations, people often have private preferences that are costly to express. So they keep quiet to maintain social status or sometimes personal safety. They say and do what they think they are supposed to say and do to get along. Hence, the “Public Lies” part of the title.
But sometimes the calculus changes. Sometimes a critical mass expresses a dangerous opinion. This empowers others to speak up. Then even more folks feel empowered. And then even more. And then there is a social revolution.
So, in theory, if Republicans reach a critical mass of members who want to defect — and I have no idea if we will reach that mass or how big that mass has to be — GOP defections could sorta happen all at once.
clare.malone: Under that rubric, was Sen. John McCain’s surprise healthcare vote an Irish goodbye?
(I digress)
micah: LOL
Well-played.
On the podcast, our stand-in for the mainstream of the Republican Party has always been Pat Toomey … has he said anything?
Ah, here ya go … the “Full Toomey”!

That was from Sunday — so before the call summary was released, but Toomey said:”It is not appropriate for any candidate for federal office — certainly including the sitting president — to ask for assistance from a foreign country. That’s not appropriate. But I don’t know that that’s what happened here.”
So if Toomey follows through on that line of thinking, maybe there is some room for GOP defection short of quid pro quo.
sarahf: I don’t know. My thought is the more this plays out in the public eye (the whistleblower report, multiple congressional hearings, etc.), the more the issue that Micah and Clare raised of “did Trump fail to uphold his constitutional duties” gets lost in the conversation, and the question of impeachment remains politicized along party lines.
clare.malone: So that goes back to the point about how Democrats will control the narrative. Democrats have to continue to be clear about what the impeachment charges would likely be about — essentially, dereliction of constitutional duty.
ameliatd: I mean, I do wonder if impeachment has become so closely tied in the public eye to criminal activity that it becomes harder for Democrats to make a clear case. That was one of the things I found most interesting about the Mueller investigation — everyone was so focused on whether there was a crime, which then made it harder to pivot to impeachment. So does it help here that there’s no special prosecutor to start dropping indictments? Or does it make it more complicated to build a narrative?
clare.malone: I think it probably makes it easier, Amelia?
sarahf: Ha, I’d say more complicated? Because now you just have partisan actors, whereas Mueller was at least thought of as impartial.
ameliatd: That does actually feel like an important difference here — with the Russia investigation, House Democrats kept leaning on Mueller to dig up some smoking gun. Here they’re clearly on their own, so maybe they’ll actually be more focused and effective in building their case.
clare.malone: Mueller wasn’t in on the PR game, either. He didn’t leak, he didn’t do interviews, etc. So this time around, it might be easier for Democrats to coordinate a strategy and message, especially now that this is all likely to unfold on more of a political battle field.
micah: Yeah, great points. So maybe it is better for Democrats.
But IDK, I feel like Democrats will have a hard time fighting the impression that Amelia mentioned — that there has to be criminal conduct to justify impeachment.
ameliatd: Right, Mueller wasn’t focused on any of these constitutional questions — he was just trying to figure out if crimes had been committed. Whereas a Democratic investigation will be much broader, and it will be public, which means it’s (potentially) easier to build momentum and make a case for unethical or unconstitutional conduct by Trump, rather than illegal conduct.
clare.malone: On-the-fly transparency rather than months of behind the scenes information and fact-gathering!
The thing that was interesting about the Mueller investigation was that so much was built upon reading between the lines on statements from Mueller’s office. I presume it will be much easier this time to build a public narrative, and sustain said narrative while you’re dropping breadcrumbs of stories week by week, day by day.
ameliatd: I do think there are plenty of ways for this to go south for the Democrats, though. If you’re building that narrative in public, it means you actually have to have effective and dramatic testimony. And if they don’t — that’s fodder for Trump and his allies.
sarahf: OK, to wrap …
There’s a lot of moving pieces still and a lot we just don’t know. What are you going to be paying attention to moving forward?
ameliatd: What’s in the whistleblower complaint??
micah: THIS ^^^
sarahf: You think that’s the key piece here, Amelia?
ameliatd: I do, and I am also so curious to know who the whistleblower is.
clare.malone: That!
What Amelia said!
ameliatd: Like, if this is a senior intelligence official — that testimony is going to be bananas.
clare.malone: That’s what I’m most interested in, too.
They’re like the unnamed star of a highly anticipated movie.
ameliatd: Especially since that person allegedly wants to testify. We saw with Mueller what happens when your witness really doesn’t want to be there, but those hearings can actually be pretty 🔥 if you’ve got someone who wants to talk.
(I guess 🔥 by the standards of congressional hearings — which I will admit is a low bar.)
micah: More generally what I’m looking for …
To what extent does evidence of quid pro quo become the red line in terms of the narrative, especially for the public and elected Republicans. You’re already seeing the White House and congressional Republicans pushing that as the criteria. But will the media buy into that and will the public? Of course, that could also bite Republicans in the end if that evidence does emerge!
Sorta redundant with No. 1, but … POLLS! What do Americans think of all this?
This is all crazy, though!!! There are huge, huge risks for Trump, Republicans and Democrats!",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Elizabeth Warren got one of her best polls of the cycle. According to a new survey by Selzer and Co. sponsored by the Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom, Warren has 22 percent support among Democrats in Iowa, the crucial first-in-the-nation caucus state. Former Vice President Joe Biden sits at 20 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders at 11 percent, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 9 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris at 6 percent.
Notably, this is the first high-quality poll to put Warren at the top of the field in Iowa, though her 2 percentage-point lead is well within the poll’s 4-point margin of error. Since the beginning of August, surveys of Iowa have been quite unsettled; some polls showed Biden with a healthy lead (but were conducted several weeks ago, before the third debate), while others showed Warren competitive or ahead (but they weren’t gold-standard1 polls).

Even though Biden still enjoys a consistent lead in national polls, it’s obviously great news for Warren if she really is leading in Iowa. The primary is a state-by-state marathon, not a single national popular vote. So if Warren wins the Iowa caucus, it could give her a boost in subsequent states and set off a chain reaction of Warren wins (New Hampshire and Nevada, in particular, look like states where she might have a natural advantage).
The Selzer poll was also significant because it counts toward candidate qualification for the fourth Democratic presidential debate — scheduled for Oct. 15 (and possibly Oct. 16) in Westerville, Ohio. And most notably, it puts Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who received 2 percent support in the poll, on the cusp of making the debate stage.

* For candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight.
To qualify for the fourth debate, a candidate must reach 2 percent in at least four national or early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations and must have at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors in at least 20 states. Information released by campaigns is used to determine whether a candidate has hit the donor threshold. If a campaign announced it had reached 130,000 donors but did not say whether it had at least 400 donors in 20 states, we assumed that it had met the latter requirement as well.
Sources: Polls, media reports
As a reminder, to qualify for the debate, candidates must receive at least 2 percent support in four qualifying national or early-state polls released between June 28 and Oct. 1 and collect campaign contributions from 130,000 unique donors (including at least 400 individual donors in at least 20 states).2
Since these are the same criteria as were used for the third debate (the only change is a longer qualification period), the 10 candidates who participated in September’s debate have already qualified for October. And earlier this month, philanthropist Tom Steyer became the 11th candidate to meet these criteria. Now, Gabbard is just one qualifying poll away from becoming the 12th. By our count, she has gotten 2 percent or more in three approved polls (including Selzer’s), and her campaign says it has already hit the fundraising thresholds.
The six other “major” Democratic candidates (by FiveThirtyEight’s definition) are all far from qualifying: Only author Marianne Williamson has met the donor requirement or has even one approved poll to her name, making Gabbard really the only candidate whose debate fate is still in suspense. But time is running out — the last day a poll can count toward the fourth debate is next Tuesday, Oct. 1.

Plus we saw a couple of young, highly touted quarterbacks take over the starting jobs on their teams just because of, well, ineptitude.
So what did we learn this week from this new crop of QBs?
Salfino (Michael Salfino, FiveThirtyEight contributor): I’m extremely surprised by how well Daniel Jones, Gardner Minshew and Kyle Allen played. We can say, “It’s easier than ever to be a quarterback because of the college passing.”
joshua.hermsmeyer (Josh Hermsmeyer, NFL analyst): It’s interesting that most of the QBs who have stepped in because of injury or ineffectiveness have played pretty well. I think the only real stinkers were Mason Rudolph and Josh Rosen. Rudolph’s completion rate is 11.7 percentage points less than we would expect (despite throwing short a lot — his average depth of pass was just 6.7 yards). Rosen was even worse. On the season, he has completed just 43.3 percent of his passes, and his completion percentage is over 18 points worse than expected.
But by and large, the new QBs were very good.
neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): It might go back to something our friend Chase Stuart has been saying for a while: There are more solid QBs in the league than we probably acknowledge.


Gardner Minshew going 22/25 for 275 yards with 2 TDs is just fueling my fire that thinks there are a lot more decent QBs out there than we realize, the NFL isn't the meritocracy we think it is, and there are likely some decent unheralded QBs out there https://t.co/srdFw9Z7ON

sara.ziegler: I just really have a hard time with Minshew Mania.
Is it a real thing? Seriously?
Salfino: Minshew was pretty meh in college.
I mean, 7.2 yards per attempt at Washington State? Big deal. If he’s so good, why wasn’t he better there?
joshua.hermsmeyer: I think it’s probably the case that accuracy is still undervalued in an NFL QB, and Minshew is certainly accurate.
neil: He has a 110.6 passer rating but ranks 30th of 35 qualified QBs in air yards per attempt. So he’s definitely not making plays happen downfield.
Salfino: Minshew seems to be getting all the swag that Baker Mayfield has lost. It’s a zero sum game with them.
neil: Douchey mustachioed QBs: There Can Be Only One.
Salfino: Love it.
sara.ziegler: LOLOLOL
joshua.hermsmeyer: JAX was very efficient with Minshew, though. They averaged 0.25 EPA per play on 18 early-down passes with Gardner. And even when we account for his low depth of target, he completed more passes than we’d expect.
neil: Jacoby Brissett was kind of the same way. He has the second-lowest air yards per attempt in the league but got the job done against Atlanta.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Bigger picture, though, one explanation for all these new QBs doing well is the importance of a game plan. And it’s hard to scheme a defense for a QB if you’ve never seen them — or only seen a little of them.
Salfino: Yes, exactly. I mean, Browning Nagle had a great first game. I was measuring him for a gold jacket, IIRC.
neil: Browning Nagle!
OMG
Not a name I was expecting to hear this morning. Or, like, ever.
sara.ziegler: What a blast from the past.
Salfino: It’s a cautionary tale.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Speaking of great first games…


Giants rookie Daniel Jones is just the second player in NFL history to throw for 300+ yards with 2+ pass TDs and 2+ rushing TDs in his first NFL start as he did in beating the Bucs today. The first? Well, it's Eric Hipple, who did that with the Lions in a 1981 win vs. the Bears.
— Greg Auman (@gregauman) September 23, 2019

Eric Hipple-level awesomeness.
neil: Wow.
sara.ziegler: So you’re saying Giants fans should temper their expectations?
Seems … unlikely.
Salfino: If I were a Giants fan, I’d be thrilled with how Jones played. He was trailing badly, he lost Saquon Barkley, and he rallied the team back late. The only thing wrong with that game from a Giants perspective was the blown field goal at the end.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Organizationally, they have to be thrilled with the win!
sara.ziegler: Jones’s performance in that game boosted his Elo points in our model by 21 points. Which seems good!
neil:

And yet Elo still rates Eli better, LOL.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Of the young QBs who played, Jones pushed the ball downfield more than anyone else. His depth of pass averaged almost 10 yards downfield. And he ran well. Reminded me of Josh Allen quite a bit.
Salfino: The reports were that he could run. And unlike Allen, he did not seem to run recklessly, either.
neil: “Reminded me of Josh Allen quite a bit.” — I think that’s a compliment…
sara.ziegler: (Also, I just confused Josh Allen with Kyle Allen, and I always confuse Josh Allen with Josh Rosen. MORE DISTINCTIVE NAMES, PLEASE.)
neil: (3-0 BILLS, BABY!)
(CIRCLE THE WAGONS)
Salfino: The Bills are this year’s Dolphins.
neil: The Bills are this year’s Bills.
sara.ziegler: 🤣 🤣 🤣
How about Teddy Bridgewater? How did you guys think he did?
joshua.hermsmeyer: Not great.
sara.ziegler: Awwww
I have a soft spot for Teddy, always.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Dink and dunk and threw short a ton, and didn’t complete many of them.
neil: He was no Eric Hipple. Or Bobby Hebert. (See, I can throw random 1980s QB names out there too!)
Salfino: I thought Payton was a coward for not starting Taysom Hill after all the Steve Young talk. But he was smart to keep using Alvin Kamara consistently. There’s no Drew Brees cushion now. So there’s no room for Latavius Murray touches in Kamara’s place. I thought Bridgewater was grinding it out, but I saw nothing from him that makes me bullish about the Saints’ chances next week against the Cowboys.
sara.ziegler: So no one was impressed with a win on the road against Seattle? Dang — tough crowd.
neil: In all seriousness, our model thought Bridgewater played OK. He played like a game manager, which basically what you want out of a guy keeping Brees’s seat warm for the next month-plus, right?
Salfino: I get the game manager thing, but I do not think the rest of the Saints team is good enough to win this way. They got lucky with another Chris Carson fumble that became the dreaded Fumble Six.
The Saints gave up 26 first downs and 515 yards and were about doubled in yardage. This win goes into the “miracle” bucket.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Still, if they can luck their way into a .500 record while Brees is out, that’s pretty promising for their playoff hopes, I think.
sara.ziegler: For sure.
neil: And for what it’s worth, we give them a 62 percent chance of winning the NFC South after yesterday’s events.
The Falcons seem very meh.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Profoundly meh.

neil: Tampa keeps finding ways to lose. And idk what to make of Carolina, which finally won but against Arizona, and with a backup under center.
Salfino: Assuming Brees steps right back into being Brees, yes. But they are 27th in yardage allowed and have allowed 6.7 yards per play. The defense is bad.
neil: That is true.
Russell Wilson had the best game from Sunday nobody is talking about. He threw for 406 yards and had two passing TDs and two rushing TDs.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Wilson is playing the best ball of his career, I believe.
Salfino: Wilson has an ability to really turn it on late in games regardless of how he’s played previously in games. Rational coaching would note how effective he is playing with his hair on fire, just make that their offense and win games early. But…
sara.ziegler: The NFC West is so interesting. The Rams have not been super inspiring in their first three games, and yet they’ve won them all.
And the Niners!
Salfino: So true about the Rams. Their offense is so consistently uninspiring. The only thing that worked yesterday was Cooper Kupp. The only quasi-good game the Saints have played on defense was at LAR.
neil: Have defenses figured out Sean McVay’s offense?
They were held without a first-half TD yesterday against Cleveland, after the same being true against New Orleans. That’s twice in three games after only happening once all regular season last year.
Salfino: Maybe some of this is due to the RB Who Used To Be Todd Gurley.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I’ve heard a lot of chatter about how teams are stealing the front Bill Belichick used against the Rams in the Super Bowl. Basically it takes away the outside runs, and some believe that it chokes off the Rams’ ability to run passing plays off of it. To the extent that’s true, then yeah, I think the NFL has figured it out.
However, if your offense is truly predicated on outside/wide zone being effective to win, I dunno. Seems bad to me.
Salfino: On the one hand, Gurley is averaging 4.6 per carry, but man, it’s a quiet 4.6. A whispering 4.6. And he has four catches for eight yards after averaging over 11 yards per catch in McVay’s first two seasons.
neil: At least Jared Goff used to be great on play-action. Now he ranks 25th out of 33 qualified QBs in QBR off play fakes. If it weren’t for Kupp, idk how bad Goff would have looked yesterday.
Salfino: And remember the play-action fade started last year around Game 11 and extended into the postseason. So if you go back, we have almost a full season worth of games where the Rams’ play-action success has been well below average.
sara.ziegler: The Rams were the first team I was going to bring up in our game of Good Team/Bad Team.
So … Not Great Team?
Salfino: Rams: OK team.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Still my favorite for the West.
neil: Good team, still. Because Aaron Donald.
sara.ziegler: Yeah, he’s just a beast. So much fun to watch.
Salfino: Donald is amazing. He can’t win Defensive Player of the Year three straight times, can he? Defensive excellence is not supposed to be this sustainably elite.
neil: According to ESPN’s Stats & Information Group, the Rams pressured Baker Mayfield on 49 percent of his dropbacks.
joshua.hermsmeyer: That’s an amazing stat, Neil. Helps explain — a little — his happy feet. He bailed on quite a few good pockets last night.
Salfino: Well, Mayfield created his own pressure at times by leaking out of the pocket for no reason and into the pass rushers.
neil: Yeah, there’s a weird Next Gen Stat from Sunday night where Mayfield did way better the less time he had to throw.
He was 5-of-18 when taking longer than 2.5 seconds to throw, including that game-sealing interception in the end zone.
idk what to do with that, but…
Salfino: He seemed surprisingly indecisive last night. He’s just in a slump, something he’s not used to.
sara.ziegler: The Browns are 1-2 now, with just the win against the Jets.
So … are they bad?
Salfino: The Browns were down seven starters last night and could have beaten a good team. I don’t think they are bad. They just need the Mayfield we thought we were getting. Coaching is a big issue too. You have both an inexperienced QB and coach now.
The Rams gave them the QB draw to win the game the last two plays and it was not taken. That’s supposed to be an automatic. I mean, Jones took it for the Giants. And Baker laughed at Jones.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Their coaching is atrocious.
I think they have plenty of talent, though, if head coach Freddie Kitchens and the offensive coordinator can get it together.
Salfino: I think we’re veering from one overreaction to the other for the Browns. They’re an 8-9 win team.
sara.ziegler: A couple more Good/Bad Teams: How good are the Packers?
neil: Our model ranks them 7th overall, which kind of sounds right? They’ve beaten some good teams, more on defense than anything else.
Rodgers has been … fine … not ELITE though.
Salfino: The Packers are not good and the offense is still disappointing.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Through three games and 93 pass attempts, Rodgers does not look transformed. That was the hope — that new head coach Matt LaFleur would unlock the old efficiency. Early returns are that A-aron is gonna throw the ball away at historical rates.
Salfino: Rodgers’s QBR is 46? Is he even good anymore? It’s been years since he’s been great. He hasn’t had even a good yards per pass attempt since … 2014.
sara.ziegler: Any other thoughts on the teams that might be good but might also be bad?
Salfino: Buffalo is not an actual contender, with a 36-year-old running back and one viable receiver. The Eagles are not bad and actually are still good — they would have won if not for seven dropped passes including the potential game-winner in the final minute. The Lions are unbeaten? Is that a misprint? They Niners are good — but 10-win good, not undefeated good. And we’re probably overreacting to the good play of the new QBs.
joshua.hermsmeyer: I can’t believe you people don’t like this guy, smh.

Richard Lugar.1 But it could happen again in 2020. On Saturday, Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy III officially launched a long-rumored primary challenge to Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, and, amazingly, it looks like he has a good chance of unseating the incumbent.
At first glance, Massachusetts may seem like a strange place to try to take down a sitting senator. After all, no incumbent U.S. senator from the Bay State has ever lost a primary election since the direct election of senators began in the 1910s. And Massachusetts politicians, like former Sen. Ted Kennedy (Joe’s great-uncle), who served for almost 47 years, and former House Speaker John McCormack, who was a congressman for 42 years, have a reputation for longevity. But that could be changing. On the House level at least, two long-serving Massachusetts congressmen have been felled in primaries this decade: Seth Moulton unseated incumbent John Tierney in 2014, and Ayanna Pressley toppled incumbent Michael Capuano in 2018.
This year, Markey will play the role of the grizzled incumbent (though he has only been in the Senate since 2013, he was a U.S. representative for 36 years before that), and Kennedy will play the young upstart (he turns 39 next week). But in reality, the race doesn’t break cleanly along “establishment vs. progressive” lines. First, the primary is not about ideology. Kennedy has a -0.423 DW-Nominate score — DW-Nominate measures politicians on a scale from -1 (most liberal) to 1 (most conservative) based on their congressional voting records — while Markey’s score is a similar -0.507, so if anything, the incumbent is more progressive than his challenger. And while Markey has marshaled the endorsements of most of the political establishment — the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, a majority of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, the leaders of the state legislature — he is also the pick of several progressive state legislators and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Most notably, he has also received the endorsement of democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with whom Markey has worked closely on the Green New Deal. Despite coming to power herself by primarying a longtime incumbent, Ocasio-Cortez has called Markey “the generational change we’ve been waiting for,” arguing that generational change is about issues, not necessarily age.
But Kennedy is far from a political newcomer. He is a four-term congressman and, more importantly, belongs to one of the most famous families in American politics; nothing says “Massachusetts political establishment” like the name Kennedy.2 The grandson of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and son of former Rep. Joe Kennedy II (who still has $2.8 million in his dormant campaign account), Kennedy will surely benefit from his family’s connections and voters’ residual goodwill for the dynastic clan. According to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll conducted earlier this month, 64 percent of likely Democratic primary voters said they had positive feelings about the Kennedy name (just the name, not any specific Kennedy) while only 7 percent reacted negatively to it.
And, unlike a traditional insurgent candidate, Kennedy starts off the race ahead according to that same poll (which was conducted before Kennedy jumped in the race); it found Kennedy had the support of 35 percent of voters and Markey had 26 percent support. (Three lesser-known candidates who were already primarying Markey registered at 1 percent or less.) That said, Markey was quite popular among Massachusetts Democrats in the poll, with a 59 percent favorable rating and a 16 percent unfavorable rating; it’s just that Kennedy was even better-liked (73 percent favorable, 6 percent unfavorable). However, there’s plenty of time for those numbers to change, and there are still lots of votes up for grabs — 36 percent of respondents in the poll were undecided.
Ultimately, despite the lack of a clear contrast with Markey, Kennedy may simply be running because he’s an ambitious politician who senses an opportunity. Even though there is a chance that Massachusetts will have an open Senate seat in the near future (if Warren’s presidential campaign is successful), Kennedy may have decided to jump in now because he thinks he has a better shot in a one-on-one primary against an incumbent than in a crowded field that could include several other potent opponents, like Pressley, state Attorney General Maura Healey or Boston Mayor Marty Walsh.3 Pressley’s own win in 2018 is a point in favor of this hypothesis, and Kennedy has even indicated he will use the same blueprint of turning out traditionally overlooked voters, like people of color.
But there are obvious differences between Kennedy and Pressley: Namely, she is a black woman and Kennedy, like Markey, is a white man. With age as the main demographic differentiator between Kennedy and Markey, the 2020 Senate primary in Massachusetts could be a good test of whether recent Democratic primary upsets like Pressley’s and Ocasio-Cortez’s were driven more by race, gender, ideology … or simply a desire for a fresh face.

So He Changed His Catching Stance.,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"As he returned home to New Mexico last winter, Mitch Garver knew he had to be better. In 2018, Garver ranked 110th out of 117 qualifying catchers in fielding runs above average. As a catcher, that meant he struggled mightily with pitch framing1 — the skill of a catcher to receive borderline pitches in a way that allows them to get favorable called strikes.
Garver turned 28 in January. He had been only a league-average hitter at the plate and a liability behind it. He knew that if he couldn’t receive the ball better, his career would be in jeopardy. He had heard that a coach hired the previous season was working miracles with the Twins’ minor league catchers. So Garver called Tanner Swanson and invited him to Albuquerque.
“It’s the only reason I’m still catching,” Garver told FiveThirtyEight. “Really.”
The Twins have surprised MLB with their offense this year, with a record five batters — including Garver — hitting 30 home runs as the team broke the single-season home run record in August.2 Minnesota is the only major league team with four position players among the top 35 qualifiers in year-to-year gains of wins above replacement. Among those Twins, Garver is the most improved, and he’s the seventh-most-improved player in all of baseball.

But Garver’s improvement with his glove has been just as dramatic as his work with his bat. This season, Garver has been worth 4.4 fielding runs above average, achieving the fifth-greatest improvement in the metric.3 Per plate appearance, his performance in wins above replacement, which includes framing value, ranks as the eighth-best mark in baseball.
The growth with his glove is where Swanson comes in. Swanson never played catcher in college, nor had he coached professionally when he joined the Twins organization in late 2017. But he spent six years working with college catchers at the University of Washington and Santa Clara University, and he attracted the attention of Jeremy Zoll, the Twins’ director of minor league operations, after a presentation Swanson gave at a catching coaching clinic.
“I kind of had a clean slate to look at it objectively. I didn’t carry all these biases — ‘Well, this is how I used to do it. This is how I was taught,’” Swanson said. “I think a lot of times as coaches, we have these drill packages that we’ve compiled and we don’t truly understand the ‘why’ or question whether a particular drill leads to improvement.”
Since the late 2000s, when analysts first quantified the value of pitch framing, more teams have started to prize catchers who can get more favorable calls for their pitchers. After all, every pitch matters: The difference in batting average on a 2-1 count and a 1-2 count is 178 points this season. Teams began paying for the skill. In 2016, the Twins were graded as the fifth-worst framing team in baseball. One of Derek Falvey’s first acquisitions after being hired as GM late in 2016 was signing pitch-framer extraordinaire Jason Castro. But Swanson believed that framing was not only an innate gift — it could be taught.
Swanson employed drills using weighted balls, implements typically reserved for pitchers, to help Twins catchers improve their hand speed and movement patterns. “You’re dealing with timing and getting the ball from point A to B. The faster we can do that the more deceptive we are,” Swanson said. “I don’t want to say fool umpires but [rather] to influence them to call borderline pitches as strikes. That’s their primary job.”
Going into this season, Garver graded as a poor receiver on balls in the lower part of the strike zone and below. Swanson said that’s a problem in today’s game, with record rates of breaking balls and changeups — pitches that typically either cross low in the zone or below it.



“A lot of times with those big-depth breaking balls, those sliders that sweep across the front of the zone, they go in and out of the zone,” Garver said. “They are very hard to catch. You have to learn how to catch them properly. I wanted to get underneath the ball when I’m receiving it.”
The most conspicuous change Swanson suggested Garver make was employing a variety of one-knee, Tony Peña-style stances, which had gone out of fashion in the professional game. Going lower, Swanson reasoned, would help a catcher get more favorable calls on lower pitches. “We didn’t invent the one-knee setup,” he said. “But those were traditionally done with nobody on base and less than two strikes.”
When runners are on base, catchers are taught to go to what Swanson calls a “secondary” stance, sitting higher to position themselves better for throwing out a runner or blocking a ball in the dirt. What Swanson proposed was going to a knee on all counts, even if it adversely affected the ability to throw or block balls.
“Only a fraction of the time does the ball actually land in the dirt. Only a fraction of the time does a runner actually try to steal,” Swanson said. “Catchers across the league perform worse … with runners on base. We’ve tried to flip it upside-down.”
Since the value of framing is tied to compelling borderline pitches to be called as strikes, FiveThirtyEight examined available Statcast data on called strikes and balls on the edge of the strike zone and the zones just off the plate. The data shows that catchers do receive less favorable calls when runners are on base. That was true of the Twins, too, until this year, when the one-knee stance came to Minnesota.

The Twins rank 12th in the majors in pitch framing this season, and Garver is up to 23rd out of 110 catchers. He has used his new stance to better “absorb” borderline pitches, and his frequency of called strikes caught has become more concentrated in the lower zone.



“[Garver] deserves the credit. His desire to improve didn’t stop once he got to the big leagues,” Swanson said. After all, Swanson notes, “He called me.”

150,000 British residents
The collapse of the British travel company Thomas Cook has stranded approximately 500,000 tourists, including at least 150,000 British residents, around the world. The company ceased trading and operations on Monday due to more than $2 billion in debt, failing to secure additional credit, as well as being denied a government bailout. The U.K.’s Civil Aviation Authority also says it expects to operate 1,000 flights to 55 destinations to pick up passengers. [Slate]
20 percent
Several American universities have reported declines of 20 percent or more in the number of new international students from China. The country accounts for one-third of all international students in the U.S., but amid strained relations and trade conflicts in addition to “growing international competition, visa complications and the development of China’s own higher education system,” the number of students enrolling in the U.S. has declined. [Washington Post]
165,000 individual donors
Democratic presidential candidates will need to meet increased polling and fundraising numbers in order to qualify for the primary debate in November. On Monday, the Democratic National Committee said candidates have to receive donations from at least 165,000 individual donors, and earn either 3 percent support in four national or early-state polls, or garner 5 percent support in two polls in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. And as my colleague Nathaniel Rakich wrote, this could mean fewer than 10 candidates make the cut in November. [FiveThirtyEight]
1,200 North American auto workers
General Motors has temporarily laid off more than 1,200 staff due to an ongoing United Auto Workers strike at its facilities in Canada and the United States. This is in addition to 4,500 other temporary layoffs announced Friday. Financial analysts estimate the strike is costing GM “up to $100 million a day in lost production.” [CNBC]
2nd-lowest level for Arctic sea ice
NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center say that Arctic sea ice is at the second-lowest level recorded since measurements were first taken in 1979. On Sept. 18, sea ice was measured at 1.6 million square miles, 811,000 square miles below the average. In addition to helping control the planet’s temperature, sea ice is integral to many Arctic communities and wildlife species, such as polar bears and walruses. [USA Today]
$144,500 per family
Families who lost relatives due to two Boeing 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia will receive approximately $144,500 each in direct payments as part of a $50 million financial assistance fund. After more than 340 people died from the flights, the company grounded the 737 Max while investigators continue to evaluate the airplane’s safety. [BBC News]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-will-make-the-fifth-democratic-debate/,2019-09-24,,,features,"Sep. 23, 2019",Who Will Make The Fifth Democratic Debate?,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Tired: Who will qualify for the fourth Democratic presidential debate in October? Wired: Who will qualify for the fifth Democratic presidential debate, in November?
We still don’t know many of the details about the fifth debate — like when it will be held or who will host it — but on Monday, the Democratic National Committee did announce the criteria that the Democratic presidential candidates must meet in order to participate. As was the case for the third and fourth debates, candidates will be required to hit both a grassroots fundraising threshold and a polling threshold — although each one got a bit harder to attain. Plus, there’s a twist: There are now two possible ways to meet the polling requirement.
The first way to qualify via polls is to receive 3 percent or higher in at least four national or early-state1 polls sponsored by a DNC-approved organization.2 (This is the same rule as for the third and fourth debates, except the minimum requirement used to be 2 percent support.) And just like before, multiple polls conducted by the same organization in the same geography don’t count for this method of qualification.
But the second “polling pathway” is totally new. If candidates get at least 5 percent support in two DNC-approved early-state polls, they also hit the polling requirement. And unlike the other polling threshold, there is no requirement that these polls be conducted by different organizations or in different geographies; for example, two Monmouth University polls of New Hampshire would suffice.
The changes to the fundraising threshold are simpler: Campaigns must now collect campaign contributions from at least 165,000 individual donors. This is an increase from the 130,000 that were required for the third and fourth debates, but not a very drastic one (by contrast, the donor requirement doubled between the second and third debates). Plus, candidates will now need at least 600 individual donors from each of 20 states or territories — again, just a slight jump from the previous requirement of 400 individual donors from each of 20 states.
Whew! So now for the million-dollar question: Who has qualified for November so far? Well … nobody. Only three qualifying polls have been released since Sept. 13, the earliest date a qualifying poll can be released to count toward the November debate.3 We can, though, show you how everyone stands right now in terms of polls and donors:

To qualify for the fifth debate, a candidate must reach 3 percent in at least four national or early-state polls or 5 percent in at least two early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations. Candidates must also have at least 165,000 unique donors, including at least 600 donors in at least 20 states or territories. Information released by campaigns is used to determine whether a candidate has hit the donor threshold. If a campaign announced it had reached 165,000 donors but did not say whether it had at least 600 donors in 20 states, we assumed that it had met the latter requirement as well.
Sources: Polls, campaigns, media reports
The top five — former Vice President Joe Biden; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — are all but guaranteed to make the stage. They have already met the donor threshold and are just one poll away from qualifying. In addition, Sen. Cory Booker is halfway to the four-poll threshold already, but his campaign says he is still stuck between 130,000 and 165,000 donors. Six other candidates have met the donor threshold, but it looks like the polling threshold may be more of a struggle for them.
Obviously, we can’t see into the future to know whether there will be enough polls out there for the likes of former Rep. Beto O’Rourke or Andrew Yang to make the debate. But we can do the next-best thing: Use the polls over the last two months as a stand-in. In other words, if the qualifying period for the fifth debate were, say, July 23 to Sept. 23,4 how much further would the debate stage be winnowed? Here’s a look at who would qualify for the debate under this hypothetical.

Shaded candidates would have qualified for the fifth debate during this time period.
Sources: Polls, campaigns, media reports
Just seven candidates would make the debate — down from a likely 11 or 12 candidates who will grace the stage in the October debate. However, some candidates would have come quite close to qualifying. For instance, Sen. Amy Klobuchar would have been just one poll shy; she has reached 3 percent support in three qualifying polls over the past two months and has reportedly also reached the 165,000-donor mark. Notably, Booker would also fall just short of both the donor and polling requirements (only three pollsters have put him at 3 percent or greater over the past two months).
Outside of those nine, only one candidate has reached 3 percent in even one qualifying poll released since July 23: Tom Steyer, in a Monmouth poll of Iowa from August. So barring any major shake-ups in the race, it seems like the fifth debate will once again cull the number of debaters — perhaps to the single digits.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-moderate-middle-is-a-myth/,2019-09-24,,,features,"Sep. 24, 2019",The Moderate Middle Is A Myth,Lee Drutman,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Graphics by Ella Koeze
Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: Independent voters will decide the election. Or better yet: Moderate voters will decide the election. Or, wait for it … If Democrats can move to the middle, they will win in 2020.
These tropes conjure up a particular image: a pivotal bloc of reasonable “independent” voters sick of the two major parties, just waiting for a centrist candidate to embrace a “moderate” policy vision. And there’s a reason this perception exits: You see just that if you look only at topline polling numbers, which show 40-plus percent of voters refusing to identify with a party, or close to 40 percent of voters calling themselves moderates.1 But topline polling numbers mask an underlying diversity of political thought that is far more complicated.
Moderate, independent and undecided voters are not the same, and none of these groups are reliably centrist. They are ideologically diverse, so there is no simple policy solution that will appeal to all of them.


To better understand the unbearable incoherence of moderates, independents and undecideds, let’s start by visualizing them. Drawing on data from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group,2 a research consortium that works with YouGov to conduct large-scale surveys, I pulled voters who3 …
Identified as “moderate”
Identified as “independent,” even when pressed to pick a party4
Said they were undecided on how they would vote in a 2020 match-up between President Trump and a generic Democrat.
Here’s how big each group is in the electorate overall, and how much they overlap:
Despite some overlap among independents, moderates and undecided voters, each group is relatively distinct. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean there are cohesive ideological beliefs within each group.
To test this, I used policy questions from the same Voter Study Group survey to make two indexes5 measuring attitudes on economic policy and immigration. I chose these two issues because they are perhaps the two most central in national politics, and they represent competing dimensions of political conflict — few voters hold consistently middle-of-the-road opinions on both issues. The indexes range from -1 (far left) to +1 (far right).6
Overall, the electorate ranges widely along both dimensions. But broadly, there are two major clusters: Democratic voters populate the lower-left part of the distribution (liberal on both economics and immigration), and Republicans populate the upper-right part of the distribution (conservative on both issues).
Independent voters, however, come from all over the ideological map:
Some independents are market-oriented and anti-immigration. More are the opposite. Many are consistent liberals on economic and immigration policy questions. Some are consistent conservatives. Some are somewhere in the middle. So, next time anybody says that some policy position will win over genuine independent voters, they aren’t addressing an obvious question: Which independent voters?
Are independents also “moderates?” It depends how you define “moderate.” If you define moderates based on self-identification, then the answer is: sort of. More than half — 58 percent — of self-identified independents in the Voter Study Group data also identify as moderate, compared to 27 percent who identify as conservative and just 15 percent who identify as liberal.
But many people who call themselves “moderate” do not rate as moderate on policy issues. Just like self-identified independents, moderates come from all over the ideological space, including moderates who also identify as independent.7
But unlike independents, moderates are more likely to be Democrats. The average moderate in the Voter Study Group data is solidly center-left on both economic and immigration issues. This, I think, has mostly to do with linguistic history: Republicans have long embraced the “conservative” label, but for decades Democrats ran away from the “liberal” label, leaving “moderate” as the only self-identification refuge for many Democrats. (Only recently has “liberal” again become a fashionable identification for the left.)
Consider the typical ideology survey question, which gives respondents three options: liberal, moderate or conservative. A voter who identifies as neither liberal nor conservative has only one other option: moderate. And moderate sounds like a good thing. Isn’t moderation a virtue?
As the political scientists Donald Kinder and Nathan Kalmoe put it, after looking at five decades of public opinion research, “the moderate category seems less an ideological destination than a refuge for the innocent and the confused.”8 Similarly, political scientist David Broockman has also written about the meaninglessness of the “moderate” label, particularly as a predictor of centrism.
The takeaway is simple: As they must with independents, any pundit who talks about “moderates” as a key voting bloc begs that second follow-up question: Which moderates?9
Finally, let’s turn to those mythic undecided voters who are supposed to determine the future of the nation. What about the 11 percent of respondents who said in the Nov. 2018-Jan. 2019 Voter Study Group survey that they weren’t sure yet how they would vote in 2020?10
Like independents and moderates, undecided voters also defy simple categorization. They also come from all over the ideological map. While pundits love to speculate and generalize about undecided voters, undecided voters themselves eschew easy summary judgments.


The upshot of all this is that if you’re a campaign trying to appeal to independents, moderates or undecided voters — or a concerned citizen trying to make sense of these groups in the context of an election — policy and ideology aren’t good frames of reference. There just isn’t much in terms of policy or ideology that unites these groups.11
Anybody who claims to have the winning formula for winning moderate, independent or undecided voters is making things up. Perhaps more centrist policies will appeal to some voters in each of these categories — but so will more extreme policies.12
And come election day, these potential swing voters may not ultimately care all that much about policy. They don’t tend to identify themselves based on ideology, and they don’t follow politics all that closely. They’re more likely to decide based on whatever random events happen at the last minute (like, say, a letter from the FBI director). These are even harder to measure and generalize about. (The good news for pundits and campaigns is that they leave even more room for open speculation and political fortune-telling.)
But OK, one final point needs clarification here — maybe we’re being too literal: Maybe what pundits are really getting at when they talk about appealing to “moderates,” “independents” or undecided voters is the “middle-est” middle of the electorate — in terms of vote choice, partisanship and ideology. Maybe they’re talking about people who identify as moderate, independent and are still undecided on 2020 — the part of the Venn diagram above where all three circles overlap.
First, this is a really small group — only 2.4 percent of the electorate falls in all three buckets. And even this super small middle of the middle is … you guessed it … all over the ideological map. Rare as these voters are, anybody who talks about winning over undecided, independent, moderate voters should first address the question: which undecided, independent, moderate voters?",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/in-the-spread-offense-era-can-wisconsin-rush-its-way-to-the-playoff/,2019-09-24,,,features,"Sep. 24, 2019","In The Spread Offense Era, Can Wisconsin Rush Its Way To The Playoff?",Jake Lourim,FiveThirtyEight,College Football,"The football game played Saturday in Madison could have taken place 20 years ago. Wisconsin performed a complete takedown of Michigan, outclassing the Wolverines on both lines. The Badgers were unstoppable in the running game, piling up 359 yards on 57 carries. They pressured Michigan on 39.6 percent of dropbacks, negating the Wolverines’ speed at the skill positions. They led 28-0 at halftime and had the ball for more than 41 out of 60 minutes.
In short, they played the game that Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh has always wanted his team to play. After he accepted his first head coaching job, at San Diego in 2004, Harbaugh told legendary Michigan coach Bo Schembechler that he would always have a fullback on his roster. As they shift toward spread concepts — Harbaugh brought in coordinator Josh Gattis last offseason to overhaul his ground-and-pound offense and replace it with a no-huddle attack as a last-ditch effort to break Michigan’s Ohio State curse — this year’s Wolverines don’t have a fullback. But Wisconsin has three, and one of them, John Chenal, scored a touchdown against Michigan. After Saturday’s rout and shutouts of South Florida and Central Michigan by a combined score of 110-0, Paul Chryst’s team is 3-0, No. 9 in the coaches’ poll and No. 8 in the AP poll. The Badgers appear to be the best version of their traditional hard-nosed, smashmouth selves. The question this year is: Is that good enough to make the College Football Playoff?
In the spread-offense era, Wisconsin would be quite the party-crasher. The Badgers this season have averaged one snap every 31 seconds, playing at a slower tempo than any of the 20 playoff teams to date. Just 41.4 percent of their play calls are passes, fewer than any playoff finalist except Georgia in 2017. Chryst’s team has run more than half of its plays (118 of 224) from under center and huddled before 99.1 percent of its snaps. On its fourth play from scrimmage Saturday, Wisconsin faced fourth-and-inches from its own 34-yard line and came out in a jumbo formation it calls “14-Hippo” featuring seven offensive linemen, two tight ends, quarterback Jack Coan and running back Jonathan Taylor. “We slowly got to where we wanted to be, right?” Chryst told reporters afterward. “It worked.”
Wisconsin has been playing this way for years; since 2005, the style has produced nine double-digit-win seasons and three Rose Bowl berths. But the Badgers have not played for a national championship in that time. They came closest in 2017, when they marched undefeated through the regular season but fell just short to Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game. That team, perhaps more than any other, illustrated the perils of playing a plodding style in this era. When it counted, Ohio State raced past Wisconsin for 57-yard and 84-yard touchdown passes in the first quarter, and the Badgers managed only one offensive touchdown in a 27-21 loss. When their defense gave them two final chances to take the lead in the fourth quarter, their offense finished those drives with a punt and an interception.
This year’s team may already be different in one area: quarterback. From 2016 to 2018, Wisconsin started the inconsistent Alex Hornibrook, whose touchdown-to-interception ratio was just 1.42 and whose highest completion percentage in a season was 62.3 percent, good for 33rd among the top 100 quarterbacks. (The other two years he didn’t make the top 100 in completion percentage.) He threw crucial late interceptions in games such as that 2017 Big Ten championship and a 2016 trip to Michigan. Coan faced no such problems Saturday, when he rushed for two touchdowns. In Coan, Wisconsin might now have a capable quarterback to pair with its defense and Taylor, its Heisman candidate running back.
This year’s Badgers have one opportunity that the 2017 version didn’t: a regular-season trip to Ohio State. Two seasons ago, Wisconsin did not play a top-15 team until the conference championship, and losing that game knocked the team out of playoff contention. This year, the Badgers can make a huge statement by beating the Buckeyes for the first time since 2010. Their schedule may even afford them two cracks at it: If they win all their other games, they could lose to the Buckeyes in their regular-season matchup next month, avenge that loss in the Big Ten title game and still make the playoff.
If they can’t beat Ohio State, the Badgers will likely become another good team with a stout defense and an offense that’s serviceable but not flashy, potentially ending up in a New Year’s Six bowl but missing the playoff. And if Wisconsin can beat its old rival, Alabama and Clemson will likely be lying in wait, setting up the ultimate test of speed versus power.1 This decade has overwhelmingly favored speed. Old-school Wisconsin is hoping it can turn back the clock.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

* For candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight.
To qualify for the fourth debate, a candidate must reach 2 percent in at least four national or early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations and must have at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors in at least 20 states. Information released by campaigns is used to determine whether a candidate has hit the donor threshold. If a campaign announced it had reached 130,000 donors but did not say whether it had at least 400 donors in 20 states, we assumed that it had met the latter requirement as well.

The poll that put her over the top was a Monmouth University poll of New Hampshire, which was also notable for other reasons. The survey showed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (with 27 percent support) and former Vice President Joe Biden (25 percent) leading in the Granite State, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (12 percent), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (10 percent) and Sen. Kamala Harris (3 percent). Gabbard got 2 percent, along with four other candidates — but all of them had already made the debate stage.
In addition to Gabbard, the 10 candidates from the September debate plus Tom Steyer have qualified for the October debate, which will take place at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, and will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times. Although the Democratic National Committee has not yet announced whether the debate will be one night or two, it’s difficult to imagine 12 candidates squeezing onto one stage. In all likelihood, then, Gabbard’s qualification means that we will have two nights of debating once again — the first on Tuesday, Oct. 15, and the second on Wednesday, Oct. 16.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Will Ukraine Be Different?,Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,The Trump Administration,"Rather suddenly, we are on a trajectory toward the potential impeachment of President Trump.
Both close allies of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and vulnerable Democrats in swing districts have signaled their desire this week to pursue impeachment proceedings over President Trump’s alleged efforts to induce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden, whose son Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukranian gas producer during Biden’s tenure as vice president. A majority of House Democrats had already expressed a desire to impeach Trump over his conduct toward Russia in the 2016 campaign and his handling of the Russia investigation, but the list of pro-impeachment Democrats then included relatively few from competitive districts, and Pelosi had largely held the reins against impeachment.
From ABC News:

This time is different. Although the story is still unfolding as I write this, impeachment is, at a minimum, highly plausible. And if Pelosi wants impeachment — as she reportedly does — she can probably get it. Democrats have a fairly comfortable majority in the House and they have been relatively unified under Pelosi. Betting markets, which had been bearish on impeachment, now assign around a 50 percent chance that Trump will be impeached (but not necessarily removed from office) during his first term.
But Democrats had better hope that something else is different this time too: public opinion. Despite Trump being quite unpopular, and despite the public largely buying Democrats’ interpretation of the fact pattern on Russia — most polls find that a majority of the public thinks that Trump sought to obstruct the investigation into Russia, for instance — impeachment was a soundly unpopular proposition.
In the table below, I’ve compiled data on all polls from PollingReport.com, a compendium of high-quality telephone surveys, on whether the public thinks Trump should be impeached or at least that Congress should begin impeachment proceedings.1 And despite the slightly different question wordings — you could favor holding hearings on impeaching Trump but not actually favor his impeachment per se2 — these polls have tended to produce similar results: Impeachment was an unpopular option through the entirety of the Russia investigation process.
On average, in all polls since the start of 2017, 38.5 percent of the public favored impeachment and 55.7 percent opposed it, which is fairly close to a mirror image of Trump’s approval and disapproval ratings. And there had been absolutely no sign that the public was moving toward impeachment. If anything, the opposite was true and impeachment had become slightly less popular. Polls conducted after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report to the public on April 183 showed an average of 37.3 percent of the public favoring impeachment, and 57.3 percent opposed. The two polls in the database conducted since Mueller’s testimony to Congress on July 24 showed even worse numbers: 33.5 percent in favor of impeachment and 59.5 percent against.
This article is meant to be forward-looking, rather than a comprehensive analysis of all facets of public opinion related to the Russia investigation. But numbers like these ought to at least give Democrats pause. Heretofore, quite a lot of voters have both disapproved of Trump’s conduct and disapproved of impeaching him.
Why this gap has persisted isn’t entirely clear. Pelosi’s reluctance on impeachment undoubtedly dissuaded some Democratic voters from getting on board; the most recent Quinnipiac poll found only 61 percent of Democrats in favor of impeachment and 29 percent opposed. Those numbers may increase now that House leadership is coming around to impeachment.
The same poll, however, found independent voters mostly against impeachment — 62 percent opposed it to 28 percent in favor. That’s despite Trump having only a 35 percent approval rating among independents in the poll. So impeachment has given Democrats problems among swing voters as well.
Another explanation may simply be that the public has a high threshold for impeachment, especially for an elected president and especially especially when that president will be on the ballot again soon. By contrast, Andrew Johnson was an unelected president when he was impeached — he had taken over the presidency after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. And the impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton took place in their second terms. Voters may not think Russia met that threshold; in fact, the Russia investigation itself was the lowest priority for midterm election voters among 12 issues that Gallup asked about last year.
One explanation that doesn’t make any sense — but which seems to come up from pro-impeachment partisans every time I’ve pointed out impeachment’s lack of popularity — is the notion that the Democrats simply weren’t focused enough on the Russia investigation or that the public didn’t know enough about it. In fact, the Russia investigation has been one of the most focused-upon news stories of our lifetime; it was the most-covered story of 2017 on the network news and the second most-covered of 2018 after Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings. And the public has not moved toward impeachment as more and more facts have been revealed about Russia, including Mueller’s exhaustive report. This is despite the fact that, as I mentioned — feel free to browse the polling results yourself — the public mostly agrees with the Democrats’ interpretation of Mueller’s findings; they do not think the report cleared Trump of wrongdoing, for instance.
Other Democrats like to cite the fact that impeachment against Nixon was initially fairly unpopular. But this comparison doesn’t entirely work either. Rather dramatic facts were being revealed throughout the Watergate investigation and impeachment process, which tended to sway public opinion. By contrast, the outlines of Mueller’s eventual findings were largely laid out for the public a long time ago, through Mueller’s various indictments and through reporting at places such as the Washington Post and the New York Times. Whereas for the past year or so at least, Democrats have had relatively little new material to work with on Russia. The increasing numbers of House Democrats who called for impeachment over the past few months didn’t seem to move public sentiment in Democrats’ favor either.
Again, none of this is meant to provide for an absolutely definitive analysis of how public opinion might have evolved if Democrats had proceeded on impeachment as a result of the Russia investigation. The sample size of impeachments is small, which make any conclusions tentative. But that uncertainty doesn’t necessarily work to Democrats’ benefit, given that the status quo is fairly promising for them electorally: Trump is quite unpopular and, although these polls don’t mean much at this stage, he currently trails all his major Democratic rivals (especially Biden, but also Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) in head-to-head matchups. Democrats are also coming off a strong midterm.


The politics of impeachment on Ukraine may be different than on Russia. But Democrats should take public opinion seriously. That doesn’t mean you always have to do the poll-driven thing. But don’t wish the numbers away because you don’t like them, or presume that they’ll change in your favor, or assume there won’t be consequences for taking an unpopular action.
More specifically for Democrats, their failure to persuade the public that Russia warranted impeachment offers several potential lessons if they are to proceed on Ukraine:
Lesson No. 1: Be narrow and specific, perhaps with a near-exclusive focus on Ukraine. For some Democrats in Congress who were nearly ready to impeach Trump over Russia, Ukraine may have been the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. But Democrats probably shouldn’t portray it to the public that way.
The public was largely not persuaded about the wisdom of impeaching Trump on Russia. And Ukraine provides a much clearer story, in some ways: Trump allegedly pressured a foreign leader to undermine one of his chief rivals in the 2020 election. It’s not a case of the cover-up being worse than the crime, or of Trump attempting to obstruct the investigation, or of actions that took place before Trump took office. It’s a direct, recent and relatively simple throughline. The more focused Democrats are on Ukraine specifically, the better chance that public opinion will turn out better for them than it did on Russia.
Even worse for Democrats than combining Ukraine and Russia would be to offer a laundry list of impeachment charges, involving the emoluments clause or Trump’s general conduct in office or what not. The public has a high threshold for what constitutes impeachable conduct, so reasons that are below that threshold might weaken the overall case for impeachment rather than being additive.
Furthermore, such a strategy would tend to play into the White House’s strengths. The White House is fairly skilled at muddying the news cycle and navigating its way through the swampy thicket of a story in ways that can fatigue the public. It isn’t a perfect analogy, but in the Kavanaugh hearings, the sheer volume of accusations against Kavanaugh eventually helped him; the less credible allegations allowed Kavanaugh and the White House to cast doubt on the more credible ones, such as Christine Blasey Ford’s. Throwing more accusations or alleged reasons for impeachment at Trump could likewise allow the White House to focus on the weakest ones.
Interestingly enough, the Washington Post op-ed by seven first-term Democrats calling for impeachment solely referred to Ukraine as a potential cause for impeachment. So Democratic leadership may agree with this strategy.
Lesson No. 2: Don’t overpromise on details unless you can deliver. You’ll sometimes hear the sentiment that the entire Mueller Report might have been more politically damaging to Trump if it had dropped all at once instead of slowly being teased out through indictments and news accounts and investigative reports over the course of two years. That seems reasonable enough, although there’s no way to test the hypothetical. It’s also true, though, that the public’s reaction to news events — and the media’s reaction to news events, which conditions the public’s response — is often calibrated relative to “expectations.” If the expectations get too far ahead of themselves, even a relatively damaging story may land with a thud.
Without relitigating the Mueller Report more than we have to, it’s safe to say that it provided neither the total exoneration that the president claimed, nor the direct evidence of collusion with Russia that Democrats might have been hoping for. That’s to say nothing of the breathless speculation about what the Mueller Report would say on cable news, or the too-frequent reporting missteps on important Russia-related stories (even if, in my view anyway, the press largely got the big picture right on Russia).
The fact that Ukraine is a much simpler story than Russia again works to Democrats’ benefit here: There are fewer details to screw up. But if Democrats promise caught-red-handed evidence above and beyond what’s been made public already (the White House has not exactly been steadfast in its denials) and doesn’t deliver on it, it’s obviously going to injure their case. And it should go without saying that the more damaging the information, the harder it could be for Democrats to obtain. That Trump has pledged to release a “fully declassified and unredacted transcript” of his phone conversation with Zelensky might make Democrats a little nervous since Trump presumably wouldn’t release it so soon if it contained many bombshells.
Lesson No. 3: Emphasize the threats to election integrity. As I mentioned, I suspect (though I certainly can’t prove) that some of the public’s reluctance on impeachment over Russia stemmed from the fact that Trump was still in his first term and is running for re-election. We want to decide this one for ourselves, the public may have been saying.
In some ways, that’s a bigger problem for Democrats on Ukraine, since the election is even closer now. But, of course, the Ukraine scandal involves the 2020 election: Trump’s efforts to impair Biden’s candidacy. My point is simply that Democrats should emphasize that angle since any impeachment hearings would take place directly against the backdrop of the election, a prospect that voters might otherwise find strange.
Lesson No. 4: Stay unified. As I said above, I don’t think Democratic infighting over impeachment on Russia explains all, or necessarily most, of its unpopularity with the general public. But it probably explains some of it. This tends to be one of Pelosi’s strengths, but the more Democrats are willing to sink or swim together on Ukraine impeachment, the more compelling their message is liable to be to the general public.
Lesson No. 5: Work quickly and urgently. Now that they’ve seemingly decided to move forward on Ukraine, there are lots of reasons for Democrats to move fast. It will reduce the potential for public fatigue over the story, which can set in quickly for all news stories in the Trump era. And a sense of urgency could underscore some of the other themes here, e.g. that there’s an immediate threat to the integrity of the 2020 election, to national security, or both.
Obviously, Democrats will need to weigh moving rapidly against Lesson No. 2 (the risk of getting too far ahead of themselves). Nobody said impeachment would be easy for anyone involved!
But the other benefit to moving fast is that, if impeachment backfires on Democrats and makes Trump more popular, Democrats will have more time to recover from that. Impeachment isn’t necessarily an all-in bet for Democrats, but it’s an awfully big one.

Those same 10 candidates will appear in the Democratic primary debate this Thursday.
Perhaps as a result of all that attention, many of those presidential hopefuls saw an increase in how much cable and online news coverage they got last week, measured as the share of all stories or clips mentioning at least one Democratic 2020 contender that included their name. Conversely, most of the candidates who weren’t involved (and will be left out of the debate this week), saw a decline, according to data from the TV News Archive1 and Media Cloud.2
Across the cable news networks we monitor — CNN, Fox News and MSNBC — the phrase “climate change” was mentioned in more 15-second clips last week than any other week this year. Five candidates — Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Cabinet secretary Julián Castro, and Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar — unveiled sweeping new proposals to tackle climate change last week, and all five received a bump in their share of mentions in both mediums. Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke also saw an increase in his share of mentions on cable news, but clips that mentioned him were more likely to mention guns than climate, suggesting that the media is paying more attention to his positions on gun control in the wake of a second deadly mass shooting in his home state.

Each network’s daily news coverage is chopped up into 15-second clips, and each clip that includes a candidate’s name is counted as one mention. For both cable and online news, our search queries look for an exact match for each candidate’s name, except for Julian Castro, for whom our search query is “Julian Castro” OR “Julián Castro.” Media Cloud searches use two of the database’s publication lists: “top online news” and “digital native” publications.

The three highest-polling candidates — former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — did appear in the CNN town halls about climate change, but were mentioned fewer times last week than the week before. Still, they remain well ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of both media mentions and support in the polls. And even in that top tier, Biden continues to lead Warren and Sanders in both online and cable news mentions for the second week in a row, leading us to ask the same question we did before the first and second debates: Can anyone end Biden’s media dominance?

2-percentage-point lead
Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s steady climb in the polls has reached a new high watermark: For the first time, Iowa’s most respected pollster has found her leading the 2020 pack in the state. The Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll released over the weekend found Warren 2 points ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden, though only one out of every five voters in Iowa say they’re certain about whom they’ll caucus for. [Des Moines Register]
40 percent of Republican congressmen
When President Trump took office in 2017 there were 241 Republicans in the House of Representatives. Now, nearly 40 percent of those politicians are either gone or plan to leave office. Most of those departures are due to a mix of electoral losses and retirements. But some Republicans, like Michigan’s Rep. Paul Mitchell, are openly fed up with Trump’s influence on the party, and want out. [The Washington Post]
136 years
The Metropolitan Opera, New York’s premier fortress for classical performance, has been around for 136 years. Yet it’s never staged an opera written by a black composer. Soon, that will change. The Met announced last week that it will stage “Fire Shut Up In My Bones,” an adaptation of a memoir by New York Times columnist Charles Blow. Its composer, Terence Blanchard, is known for his scores for Spike Lee movies, including the Oscar-nominated score for “BlacKkKlansman.” [The Root]
27 years
Israel has been waiting days to find out the consequences of their most recent election, and on Sunday it got a hint of what’s to come. Arab politicians exerted their power to help pick the prime minister for the first time in 27 years, saying they did not want current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s to continue on in the job. That may allow a rival party to try and form a government. [The New York Times]
$31 million
“Downton Abbey,” the comedy of manors that once aired on PBS in the U.S., returned over the weekend to a big box office haul, making $31 million in domestic theaters. I’m sure there’s another easy joke to make, but I never saw the show and I’m already sweating whether the “comedy of manors” crack is accurate. [Box Office Mojo]
0.2 degrees Celsius
Climate change statistics have a way of blurring together into one big smudge of bad news. But one number caught my eye in the World Meteorological Organization’s latest report. As the BBC put it: “Recognising that global temperatures have risen by 1.1 degrees C since 1850, the paper notes they have gone up by 0.2C between 2011 and 2015.” That’s a lot of warming in just five years.

Then The Ukraine Story Broke.,Dhrumil Mehta,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"On Friday, The Wall Street Journal broke a story about a phone call between President Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, in which the president allegedly asked Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden. And the story has quickly taken over Biden’s news coverage.
According to data from the TV News Archive,1 which chops up cable news from three networks we monitor — CNN, Fox News and MSNBC — into 15-second clips, the five words used most often in clips mentioning Joe Biden last week were: “president,” “Ukraine,” “Trump,” “son” and “investigate.” More than a third of the clips from Friday and Saturday that mentioned Biden also mentioned Ukraine. And according to data from Media Cloud,2 a database of online news, over 60 percent of stories that mentioned Biden in those two days also mentioned Ukraine.
And the story seems to have helped keep Biden’s name at the top of the cable-news heap. Biden was mentioned in a larger share of cable news clips than the next six Democratic candidates combined last week, including in more than two and a half times as many clips as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and more than five times as many as Sen. Bernie Sanders. But the trend doesn’t hold in online news — there, Biden is still the most-mentioned candidate, but by a much smaller margin.

The story about Trump’s call to Ukraine is likely to continue to unfold in the coming week. Impeachment talk is once again swirling among Congressional Democrats, and Sen. Mitt Romney has expressed concerns over the matter, making him the first big-name Republican to do so. In the coming week, we’ll be looking at the numbers to see just how much this story continues to permeate media coverage of Biden’s 2020 campaign.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-the-best-place-to-move-if-youre-worried-about-climate-change/,2019-09-20,,,features,"Sep. 19, 2019",Here’s The Best Place To Move If You’re Worried About Climate Change,Maggie Koerth,FiveThirtyEight,Climate Change,"This summer, we asked readers to send us their climate change questions. A lot of those questions sat squarely under umbrella topics we expected: how climate science works, what individuals can do to prevent greenhouse gas emissions and what crazy technological solutions might actually be effective. We’ll be coming back to those later. But first, we wanted to address a different sort of question: Who is winning climate change? Sure, climate change is a very bad thing in a larger, existential sense. But are there animals and plants whose habitats will expand in a warmer world? Is there anybody who has figured out how to profit off the coming apocalypse? Won’t some places be nicer to live in than others? You wanted to know. We’re going to find out. 
Matthew Kahn has dreamed about buying a climate change retreat. If anybody would know where to go, you’d think it would be an environmental economist who literally wrote the book on which cities will adapt to a warming world and how they’ll do it. But rather than investing in land that’s safe from the risks of coastal flooding, midwestern downpours and crippling drought — Kahn was thinking Bozeman, Mont. — he’s instead settling into a new job in Baltimore, a city that’s expected to be flooding daily by the end of the century.
When we asked for your climate change questions, we ended up with 20 different responses that were all asking a version of the same thing: Where should I move if I want to avoid the worst of it?
Turns out, finding a place in the U.S. that is benefiting from climate change is both easy and hard, researchers say. It’s not difficult to find the places at the lowest risk of experiencing the biggest hazards. Popular Science has mapped it using data from a variety of scientific research papers and risk assessment reports. Economists have mapped it based on projected changes in various quality of life indexes. Nonprofits are working on projects that will map it based on flooding risks.
But it’s one thing to look at these maps and start dreaming of your climate condo in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. It’s another thing entirely to say that it is a place you should move now. Or that the Upper Peninsula is necessarily going to “win,” just because in the long term it’s less subject to the negative side effects of a changing climate. The problem is one of both personal preferences and economics. We don’t all like the same weather. We seldom make investment choices on long time scales. We value things about our hometowns, other than whether they’re safe from a wildfire. It’s hard to predict which regions might win climate change when we don’t all agree on what “win” means.
“There are a couple of areas, in the short run, that actually improve,” said David Albouy, professor of economics at the University of Illinois. In 2016, he published a paper that compared the places Americans currently prefer to live with the predicted environmental change under global warming. In doing so, he produced maps of how quality of life might change in various parts of the country. “It’s still a generation away,” he said. But according to his estimates, Northern Minnesota, Seattle, Portland, Ore., and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan could all end up with more moderate temperatures and weather patterns than they currently have.
His maps, which include upstate New York and much of New England among the regions improved by climate change, somewhat align with estimates of the safest places to live made by mapping disaster risk alone. That’s especially true for the Upper Peninsula, a region fortunate enough to avoid increased risks of sea level rise, drought, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires and disease-carrying mosquitoes.
But despite the occasional trend story about coastal millennials moving to places that seem better positioned to ride out the ravages of climate change, there’s no real evidence that the Upper Peninsula is attracting new residents due to its climate prospects. In fact, nearly every county in the region has lost population in the last decade. Somebody found the place you should move. But nobody is moving there. So what gives?
That’s partly because real estate investing works at a different pace than climate change does, Albouy and Kahn told me. The maps that show the Upper Peninsula winning against other parts of the country are forecasts of the year 2100. “But why does it matter that [the value of the land] will go up in 100 years?” Albouy said.
Even coastal Florida, a region that’s been repeatedly affected by rising sea levels and storm surge from hurricanes, hasn’t yet seen a decrease in property values, said Matthew Eby, founder and director of First Street Foundation, a nonprofit that’s attempting to improve and expand flood risk mapping in the United States. The value of those homes aren’t rising as fast as homes further inland, he told me. His modeling suggests hundreds of millions of dollars in lost appreciation value. But the prices are still rising, and coastal property continues to be worth more than inland property. Just as climate scientists have long warned about the way climate change’s slowly raising stakes make them easier for politicians to ignore, real estate investors are also subject to the frog-in-a-pot-of-boiling-water problem.
That’s not the only reason there’s not a run on real estate in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., however. Let’s back up to the study that Albouy published. His approach was based on calculating the financial drawbacks Americans are willing to put up with in exchange for pleasant weather today. For instance, wages are basically average in Hawaii and the cost of living is exceptionally high. But lots of people live there anyway. “Why? Because the weather is perfect,” he said.
But here’s where spotting the climate winners gets tricky, Albouy told me. When people talk about the best place to move to avoid climate risks, he thinks they’re usually thinking about places that are currently too cold becoming, well, more like California and other parts of the country in which Americans are willing to take economic losses in order to enjoy today.
But that’s not how climate change works. Michigan is getting warmer and wetter, but it’s still colder than Albouy’s calculations — or 30 years of data on American internal migration — suggest Americans really want it to be. Meanwhile, climate change tends to exacerbate extremes and increase the risk of probabilistically rare disaster events — things that don’t really make a place better even if they make it warmer. Imagine a Chicago with winters that aren’t much different than they are today, but summers that are more like those of Memphis. “Climate change doesn’t deliver quite the climate change they’d like to see,” he said.
Even if it did, Kahn said, there are all kinds of incentives — both social and economic — that make staying in a riskier region attractive. Consider the citizens of New Orleans, who have for generations known their city was prone to flooding and saw rising sea levels for years before Hurricane Katrina. Research since that disaster has shown that survivors who were displaced by the storm ended up making more money in their new cities. So why not move sooner? New Orleans had their families and their communities, and moving itself is expensive, Kahn said.
In the end, leaving a risky city before you have to might not look like a great option, even if you stand to economically benefit in the long run. If your climate “win” is at odds with where your family and friends are, it might not actually be a win.
CORRECTION (Sept. 20, 2019, 11:00 a.m.): A previous version of this article used the word “Yooper” to refer to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. That was an incorrect use of the word. The U.P. is the place. The Yoopers are the people.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-americans-want-u-s-forces-to-defend-saudi-arabia/,2019-09-20,,,features,"Sep. 20, 2019",Why Americans Might Be Convinced To Support A War With Iran,Dhrumil Mehta,FiveThirtyEight,The Trump Administration,"Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.
Poll of the week
After an attack on a Saudi oil facility last Saturday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo swiftly pointed the finger at Iran, and on Sunday Trump tweeted that the U.S. was “locked and loaded.” Although administration officials denied that Trump’s tweet referred to an impending U.S. military strike against Iran, the rhetoric from the White House has nevertheless made the possibility of an armed conflict between the U.S. and Iran — which about half of Americans expect “within the next few years,” according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in May — seem more likely than before.
And a SurveyMonkey poll by Business Insider conducted earlier this week found that only 13 percent of Americans support a U.S. military response to the attack on Saudi oil facilities. The poll, which didn’t mention Iran specifically, also found that about half of Americans felt the U.S. should either remove itself entirely from the situation or limit its response to condemning the attack and possibly sanctioning the perpetrators.
But while the SurveyMonkey poll suggests there’s little public appetite for U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabia’s response to the attack, a survey conducted in June found that the use of military force in Iran may be one military intervention that the U.S. public could get behind, especially if Americans perceive Iran’s nuclear capabilities as a threat. In that survey, which was released earlier this month by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, 70 percent of respondents, including 82 percent of Republicans and 66 percent of Democrats, supported using U.S. troops to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. And as you can see in the chart below, there’s a lot more support for sending troops to Iran than to other parts of the world, including Iraq, Syria and China.
I spoke with Dina Smeltz, the lead author of the survey and a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, about why Amercians seem more willing to commit U.S. troops to stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons than to other causes. “If Americans perceive a threat to our own country or to an ally, they are willing to support the use of force,” Smeltz said. “But if they see it as an internal matter abroad [or] not a direct threat to the United States, they are more reluctant.”
And it’s entirely possible that Americans perceive the attack on Saudi oil facilities as an issue that doesn’t directly endanger the U.S., but believe that Iran’s nuclear capabilities are a threat. Iran has denied that it was behind the attack, but that’s not the only recent sign of aggression. Iran has been taking steps to upgrade its nuclear infrastructure, publicly violating the 2015 nuclear deal that the U.S. helped negotiate and then abandoned in 2018, and Americans may perceive Iran’s pursuit of nuclear capabilities as a threat. Additionally, Smeltz told me that if the Trump administration portrays the Saudi attack as a direct threat to the United States, it could help shore up support for a military approach.
But while the Chicago Council on Global Affairs poll might seem to indicate that an overwhelming majority of Americans are ready to go to war over Iran’s nuclear capabilities, it did find that support dropped when specific types of military interventions were proposed: In response to a question that asked respondents what strategies they’d favor if Iran withdrew from the nuclear deal altogether, 51 percent said they’d support conducting cyberattacks against Iran’s computer systems, 48 percent said they’d support airstrikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, and 40 percent said they’d support sending troops to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities — all significantly lower than the 70 percent that said they supported sending U.S. troops to Iran to stop them from obtaining nuclear weapons.
And there’s another reason to think that this poll may have overstated overall support for military intervention in Iran: The Chicago Council on Global Affairs asked about Iran in the context of other military conflicts, whereas a July poll from Fox News asked about military intervention only in Iran. The Fox News poll found that far fewer Americans — 53 percent — favored military action to stop the development of nuclear weapons. When asked about the discrepancy, Smeltz said the true answer is “probably something in between the two.” She added, however, that regardless of whether the real number is closer to 40, 50 or 70 percent, messaging from the White House or the media characterizing Iran as a threat could drive up support for military intervention, especially if “a big chunk of the population is already willing to support the use of force.”
At this stage at least, Americans still prefer a non-military approach to Iran: According to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs poll, 81 percent of Americans said they either “somewhat” or “strongly” support continuing diplomatic efforts to get Iran to stop enriching uranium if the country withdraws from the nuclear deal, and 78 percent said they somewhat or strongly support tighter economic sanctions. A Gallup poll conducted in July also found that a majority of Americans preferred that the U.S. rely on economic and diplomatic efforts rather than military action — although 42 percent told Gallup that the U.S. should take military action if diplomatic and economic measures fail.
For now, the administration seems to have decided against immediate military action, and on Wednesday, Trump announced tighter economic sanctions on Iran in response to the attack. But Trump has not entirely ruled out using military force, and if he were to exercise a military option against Iran, the polling we have so far seems to indicate that it may not be very popular — but that could change if the administration can convince the public that Iran’s actions are a threat to the United States.
Other polling bites: 
57 percent of Americans view segregation in schools as a “very” or “moderately serious” problem, according to a Gallup poll released this week. Of the four policy proposals Gallup offered as methods of reducing school segregation, the most popular option was establishing more regional magnet schools (79 percent of respondents said they were in favor). The least popular option, with 43 percent in favor, was requiring districts to bus students to neighboring schools to increase schools’ racial diversity, a policy that became a flash point in the first Democratic debate between Sen. Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden.
YouGov and FairVote teamed up to simulate the Democratic primary under a ranked-choice voting system. The system asked voters to rank the candidates by preference (with the ability to rank 10 of 20 candidates or just the five candidates with the highest polling averages). The candidate with the fewest votes was then eliminated and his or her votes redistributed to each voter’s next choice. This process is repeated until one winner remained. In the first-round tally of the five-candidate version of this poll, former Vice President Joe Biden led Sen. Elizabeth Warren 33 percent to 29 percent, but after eliminating and redistributing according to ranked choice, Warren led Biden 53 percent to 47 percent. Unfortunately for the Warren campaign, that’s not how the Democratic primary works.
Following the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in August, the National Rifle Association’s popularity has taken a hit: Less than 50 percent of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of the organization, according to a Gallup poll. This is only the second time in the last 30 years that the NRA has been this unpopular. However, much of its current unpopularity is due to Democrats and independents turning against the organization, not a shift among Republicans, who largely hold positive views of the organization (87 percent had a favorable opinion).
In the week following the third Democratic debate, Warren seems to be continuing her steady rise in the polls, though Biden maintains the lead. A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released on Tuesday showed Warren increased support from 19 percent in July to 25 percent. That’s in line with other initial post-debate polls as well, including the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll and Morning Consult poll, which both found modest gains for Warren since the debate.
Afghanistan’s national elections will take place on Sept. 28, five months after their original April date. According to a July 2018 Gallup poll, only 19 percent of Afghans are confident in the honesty of their elections, the lowest among the countries that Gallup polled in South Asia. In that same poll, 91 percent of respondents said corruption is widespread in the Afghan government.
According to a Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation poll, roughly 7 in 10 teenagers said the effects of climate change will cause “a moderate or great deal of harm” to people in their generation, which is slightly higher than the percentage of those 30 or older who said the same. What’s more, 24 percent of teenagers have engaged in climate change activism, either attending a climate change rally, contacting a public official or participating in a school walkout to raise climate change awareness, which The Washington Post described as “a remarkable level of activism for a group that has not yet reached voting age.”
The long-anticipated storming of Area 51 — a Facebook event in which 2.1 million users indicated they planned to raid a highly classified military base looking for aliens — is today. A Gallup poll from earlier this month reveals that a third of U.S. adults believe that prior UFO sightings have actually been alien spaceships. Another 16 percent say they have seen something they thought was a UFO. To boot, 68 percent of Americans believe the government is withholding information about UFOs — so I guess we’ll have to wait and see what the raid finds.
Trump approval 
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 42.1 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.7 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -11.6 points). At this time last week, 41.6 percent approved and 53.7 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -12.1 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 42.2 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.7 percent, for a net approval rating of -11.5 points.
Generic ballot 
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.8 percentage points (46.8 percent to 40.0 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 6.6 points (46.4 percent to 39.8 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.3 points (46.2 percent to 39.9 percent).

Depending on which factors you emphasized, the top group could plausibly consist of any number of candidates from one (Joe Biden) to five (Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg).
The Houston debate didn’t upend the campaign overnight; polls since the debate don’t show huge movement. You can, of course, find big swings for individual candidates in individual polls if you’re willing to cherry-pick, but you shouldn’t do that.
The post-debate polls do, however, reinforce some trends that were already in the works before:
They tend to argue for the presence of a top two (Biden and Warren) as opposed to a top three (Biden, Warren and Sanders), especially if you look at polls of Iowa.
They make it awfully hard to argue that Harris belongs in the top tier. (I recently argued that Harris did belong in the top tier, so put that take in the “didn’t age well” bucket, at least for now.)
Meanwhile, a new trend since the debate is that several of the lower-tier candidates, such as Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke, are showing slightly livelier numbers, although we’re still only talking the low-to-mid single digits.
Let’s touch on the new national and early-state polls, and then we’ll revisit each of these themes. There are quite a few of these: seven new national polls conducted entirely since the Houston debate, which variously contain good news for Warren, Biden and Sanders. For the gory details of which polls are included and what they say, see the footnote.1

We also have two new polls of Iowa since the debate, which look good for Warren and Biden but not particularly for Sanders; instead, those polls show Buttigieg and (in one of the two polls) Klobuchar outperforming their national numbers.2

As I said, that’s plenty of data to choose from — or to cherry-pick from — so this is precisely the sort of time when it’s useful to look at the polling average instead of individual polls. Since the new polls vary a lot in sample size and pollster quality, I’ve weighted the average using the same algorithm we use for our Trump approval ratings calculation:

The trend reflects the average change as compared to the previous, pre-debate edition of the same poll, except in the case of the Civiqs Iowa poll, where it reflects a comparison to the average of all Iowa polls in August. Only candidates who participated in the third debate are listed in the table.
There’s not a ton of movement in the national polls. On average, Biden held steady at 30 percent. Warren and Sanders’s position isn’t much changed, but she does appear to be about 4 points ahead of him nationally and has continued to gain ground slowly but steadily, having now reached 20 percent in the polling average. The biggest gainer since the debate is actually O’Rourke, who added an average of 1.2 percentage points, although that still puts him only in the low-to-mid single digits. The biggest loser is Harris, who is down to only about 6 percent and lost another 2 points or so in the most recent round of polls, although some of that movement predates the debate itself.
In Iowa, the major headline is that Warren and Biden form a clear top two in the post-debate polls — a clearer top two there than in national polls. Iowa has always looked like a relatively strong state for Warren and a weak one for Biden, so this isn’t a huge surprise, but the trends are nonetheless favorable for Warren. The rest of the field also looks a bit different in Iowa than it does nationally; as I mentioned, the Midwestern candidates — Klobuchar and especially Buttigieg — are doing quite a bit better in the Hawkeye State. Sanders, meanwhile, is surprisingly weak in Iowa given that he nearly won the state last time around, although other Iowa polls have shown better numbers for him than the two released since the debate. The new edition of the Selzer/Des Moines Register poll is due out soon, which should help us to confirm whether the new polls are a trend or a fluke.
For me, that all adds up to something like this:

None of this looks dramatically different than before the debate, but to revisit those themes I touched on before …
Theme No. 1: There’s a better case for a Top 2 (Biden, Warren) than a Top 3 (Biden + Warren + Sanders). I’ve done something slightly sneaky with my tiers, which reflects the fact that Warren’s position continues to improve incrementally — rather than meteorically — relative to Sanders’s. As before, I have Sanders as the third most likely Democrat to win the nomination. (Keep in mind that these rankings aren’t driven by any sort of statistical model;3 they’re my subjective opinion, which sticks fairly closely to be polls but doesn’t omit other factors entirely.) But I’m demoting him to tier 2a from tier 1c. (I’m also demoting Harris, who has bigger problems than Sanders does — see the next item.)
You could argue that Sanders and Warren belong in the same tier since they’re almost tied in national polls. But they aren’t quite tied anymore; Warren is ahead in the average of national polls, as you can see above.
That alone might not be enough to put Warren in a higher tier than Sanders. But virtually every other polling-based metric other than the topline numbers in national polls tends to favor Warren over Sanders:
As I mentioned, she’s doing a fair bit better than Sanders in Iowa, especially in post-debate polls. (New Hampshire, where there hasn’t been any post-debate polling, is more of a mess.)
She has equal favorable ratings to Sanders and Biden, but lower unfavorable ratings, meaning that she’s more broadly acceptable to Democratic voters; she also tends to do better than Sanders when polls ask about voters’ second choices or which candidates they’re considering.
Although past movement in the polls doesn’t necessarily predict future movement, she obviously has the most momentum, having slowly but steadily gained in the polls for several months now.
In Iowa, and increasingly in national polls, she generates more enthusiasm than other candidates, including Sanders.
She does considerably better than Sanders among Democrats who are paying the most attention to the race, possibly a leading indicator of what will happen as more voters tune into the campaign later on.
And although the gap is closing, she’s still slightly less familiar to voters than Sanders, which implies that she has more room to grow.
The one factor working in Sanders’s favor is that his coalition appears to be a bit more diverse in terms of race and educational status; Warren is eventually going to have to expand her coalition beyond liberal, college-educated whites. On the other hand, Sanders has historically had problems with several major Democratic constituencies, including blacks over the age of 40, whites over the age of 55, and moderate voters of all races and ages. Overall, even from a “polls only” perspective, Warren is now in a meaningfully better position than Sanders.
And if you look at non-polling factors, the gap between Warren and Sanders increases. Empirically, the best way to look at the primaries apart from polls is through a “Party Decides” perspective, wherein so-called “party elites” — influential Democrats such as elected officials — are instrumental in picking the nominee, or at least are a leading indicator of voter preferences. Sanders is a problematic and even implausible nominee by this metric; he rather proudly doesn’t get along with the party establishment (and technically isn’t even a Democrat) and instead is running more of a factional campaign where he hopes to win the largest plurality of voters rather than necessarily uniting the party. Warren also doesn’t do terrifically well in this framework. (Party elites seem to prefer Biden and Harris.) But she has more endorsement points than Sanders does, and there’s lots of reporting to suggest that she has better relationships with party insiders than him. Particularly in the event of a contested convention, when superdelegates are allowed to vote on the second and subsequent ballots, this could be a big advantage for her. She’s also winning more support from progressive groups and organizations such as the Working Families Party and MoveOn.org which may or may not get along with the Democratic Party establishment, but can help to turn out voters in primaries and caucuses.
So while I don’t know that I’d go as far as prediction markets, which have Warren with a 35 to 40 percent chance of winning the nomination and Sanders at only 10 to 15 percent, there’s quite a bit to differentiate them, with most of the indicators in Warren’s favor.
As to whether Warren is more likely to win the nomination than Biden, I’m not quite ready to go there yet. (I still have Biden in tier 1a and Warren in tier 1b.) As my colleague Clare Malone likes to say on our podcast, Biden is still the “statistical frontrunner”: If you built a model consisting solely of objective indicators — e.g. national polls, Iowa polls, endorsements — he’d probably still be ahead. That isn’t necessarily the only way to look at the nomination. But I’d like to see Warren win a few more endorsements, and I’d like to see a couple more polls showing her leading in Iowa and New Hampshire, before removing Biden’s front-runner status. Warren is also near an empirical inflection point in national polls; once you get to 20 percent or so, you go from a factional candidate to a real threat to win the nomination. To the extent she can continue gaining ground — going from 20 percent to 25 percent, say — that would be a pretty huge deal for her, especially if those gains came from voters other than college-educated white Democrats.
Theme No. 2: Harris is in trouble. As I said earlier, I’ve mostly been bullish on Harris throughout the campaign. She’s a strong “Party Decides” candidate and she’s still second in endorsements behind Biden, although her pace of endorsements has slowed since a flurry of them after the Miami debate. But she’s in real danger now. Rather than uniting the party, she’s losing college educated liberals to Warren and black voters to Biden. She’s also well behind in polls of Latino voters.
There’s still plenty of time to turn it around, but the risk is that donors, voters and potential endorsers abandon her for a candidate who appears to have more momentum. (Harris’s fundraising totals for the third quarter, which closes on Sept. 30, will reportedly be weak.) Buttigieg has caught up with her to tie for fourth place nationally and is in a stronger position than her in Iowa and New Hampshire. And O’Rourke, Cory Booker and even Andrew Yang are right on her heels nationally. Media coverage is also a factor here: If media coverage that was once devoted to Harris begins to go to candidates such as O’Rourke and Booker instead, that could deepen her problems. And I’m not sure that refocusing her campaign on Iowa, her latest strategic gambit, is going to help.
Theme No. 3: There’s a little bit of life in the third tier. I don’t want to overstate this, since going from 2 percent to 3 percent means you’re still … at 3 percent. But (with the exception of Julián Castro) this is the best set of polling for candidates outside of the top 5 in a while. That’s not entirely surprising, since voters gave several of these candidates — notably Klobuchar, O’Rourke, Yang and Booker — relatively good marks for their debate performances. If anything, the problem is that a number of these candidates had strong evenings, so voters who were shopping around for new alternatives were divided several ways between them.
Perhaps the most interesting number of all in the new set of polling was Klobuchar’s 8 percent in the David Binder poll of Iowa; among other things, a Klobuchar mini-surge in Iowa could cause big problems for Biden by crowding the moderate/electability lane there. But that number hasn’t been replicated in other surveys yet.
All of this does leave one to wonder whether candidates such as Booker and Klobuchar were hurt by the large field and getting mixed up with the Marianne Williamsons and Eric Swalwells of the world. I’ll stick with what I said last week: If you’re polling in the low single digits, you’re probably toast. But let’s hold off on declaring their campaigns dead until at least the next debate.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-are-so-many-democrats-considering-ending-the-filibuster/,2019-09-20,,,features,"Sep. 23, 2019",Why Are So Many Democrats Considering Ending The Filibuster?,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"The Democratic primary is full of big ideas. Candidates are vying to offer the most ambitious plan to combat climate change. They’re sparring over dramatic changes to the health care system and proposing sweeping gun control legislation. But they keep running up against the same question: How are they going to pass their policy agenda through the Senate?
It’s a conundrum that has thrust the Senate’s rules and procedures — specifically, the fate of the legislative filibuster, which requires a supermajority to end debate on a piece of legislation — into the center of the Democratic primary. Because even if Democrats manage to win both the White House and the Senate in 2020, the 60-vote requirement to break a filibuster could easily allow Republicans to halt some of the Democrats’ biggest policy proposals.
In response, the call to end the filibuster is turning into a rallying cry on the left. Progressive activists, who see Republicans’ use of the filibuster to obstruct President Obama’s agenda as a cautionary tale, are now pushing primary contenders (and even senators) to get rid of it. And increasingly, the candidates seem open to the idea — although like most structural changes in government, killing the filibuster is more easily said than done.
How the filibuster could be a barrier to Democrats’ policy agenda
Over the past 10 years or so, the filibuster has increasingly become a weapon of obstruction for the minority party. As a result, its enemies now include both President Trump and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have argued that it gives the minority an unfair veto over the majority’s agenda. And it’s true, at least, that filibustering has become more and more routine. And as the chart below shows, the number of times senators have filed a motion to invoke cloture — the first step in ending a filibuster1 — has more than doubled between George W. Bush’s presidency and Trump’s presidency. It first spiked dramatically in 2007, when Republicans lost their Senate majority in the 2006 midterms and began using the filibuster much more aggressively than either party had in the past. The trend only accelerated after Obama took office in 2009. “We’re now in a situation where you really need 60 votes in the Senate to get anything done,” said Josh Chafetz, a professor at Cornell Law School who studies Congress.
The filibuster’s defenders argue that it remains an important tool that forces negotiations between the majority and minority parties. But this hasn’t stopped both parties from weakening it. Frustrated by the Republicans’ refusal to confirm Obama’s nominees to the lower courts and executive branch posts, Democrats got rid of the filibuster requirement for those nominees in 2013. Four years later, the Republicans ditched the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees to confirm Neil Gorsuch.
Now, the legislative filibuster is the last vestige of the minority’s obstructionary power, and it could turn into a serious roadblock for Democrats if they win control of the presidency and the Senate. “The lesson of the past 10 years or so is that minority parties have realized it’s in their interest to block whatever the majority is doing,” said Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami who studies the filibuster.
This tendency toward obstruction probably hurts Democrats more than Republicans, experts said, because Democrats are more likely to campaign on big, sweeping changes to the system that require legislation to become reality. Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and an expert on Congress, pointed out that earlier in the 20th century, the filibuster was mostly used by southern segregationist senators to stymie anti-lynching bills and civil rights legislation. “The history of the filibuster is not especially favorable to liberal causes,” she said. “Arguably, it’s in the Democrats’ interest to get rid of the filibuster because they’re more likely to pursue activist solutions to policy problems.”
Progressive activists are pushing the candidates on filibuster reform
Some liberal activists think the filibuster is an existential threat to the bold policies that are being debated in the Democratic primary. “The filibuster is about the future of American democracy,” said Ezra Levin, the co-executive director of Indivisible, a national progressive movement that recently launched a campaign against the filibuster. “If it exists in 2021 and 2022, it won’t matter if the Democrats have won the presidency and the Senate — all of those progressive proposals we’re debating will be defeated and stalled.”
And in the last few months, killing the filibuster has gone mainstream. When their campaigns were just getting off the ground, many of the candidates — particularly the senators — seemed leery of getting rid of it. But Warren and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee both started openly calling for the filibuster’s demise, and other candidates appeared to warm to the idea, too. According to The Washington Post, 12 active presidential candidates that FiveThirtyEight considers “major” have either said that the filibuster needs to go or that they’re open to eliminating it.
The issue even came up briefly in the third Democratic debate, when Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders disagreed about the right way to circumvent the 60-vote requirement. So far, Sanders has opposed getting rid of the filibuster, but his solution for avoiding a filibuster is also quite radical. He’s proposed ramming his signature legislation, Medicare for All, through the Senate using the budget reconciliation process. That would only need 51 votes for passage, but it would still involve a dramatic reinterpretation of Senate rules and leave the door open for other non-budgetary proposals to be passed the same way. “Sanders might be trying to reassure voters who think ending the filibuster is too extreme, but what he’s proposing would effectively get rid of the filibuster,” Chafetz said.
But killing the filibuster is easier said than done
None of this means, however, that the filibuster’s fate is sealed. For one thing, filibuster reform won’t be possible for the Democrats unless they have the White House and the Senate under their control. And even if that happens, supporters of ending the filibuster will have the not-so-simple task of convincing Senate Democrats to give up a power that is undeniably helpful to the minority. Sanders, in particular, has cited Trump’s eagerness to end the filibuster as a warning about how eliminating it could backfire when Democrats are out of power.
One common defense of the filibuster is that it’s key to ensuring that the spirit of compromise remains in the Senate. Most of the political scientists I spoke with were skeptical, though, pointing out that the supermajority requirement to end debate hasn’t always been part of the Senate rules, and has been changed several times over the course of the past century.
But the filibuster has another benefit that could make some Senate Democrats reluctant to get rid of it — the 60-vote requirement insulates the majority party from blame when it fails to deliver on big, sweeping policies. One hypothesis I heard suggested that Senate Republicans didn’t do away with the legislative filibuster during the first two years of Trump’s presidency because it gave them an excuse to avoid acting on the more politically risky aspects of Trump’s agenda, like the border wall. It also saves middle-of-the-road senators from being responsible for the fate of controversial legislation. “If the filibuster is still around, a moderate Democrat like Joe Manchin doesn’t have to be the deciding vote on Medicare for All,” Koger said.
Liberal advocates told me they’ll cross that bridge when they come to it — for now, they want to make sure the issue continues to pick up steam in the primary. Their pitch to politicians and voters is that a policy like the Green New Deal is just too important to be defeated by worries about changing Senate procedure. “I get the concerns about the Democrats losing their voice when they’re in the minority,” said Aaron Belkin, a political science professor at San Francisco State University and progressive activist. “But you have to weigh that against the cost of not acting in response to impending planetary disaster.”
And in the long term, most of the experts I spoke with said the filibuster’s days are probably numbered. “Eventually, one of the parties is going to get control of Congress and the White House and want to actually enact the policies they ran on,” Chafetz said. “When that happens, the filibuster is toast.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Riddler Express
This week, Riddler Nation needs your help designing its new credit card, appropriately named Riddler Express™ — don’t solve puzzles without it!
The logo consists of two overlapping circles with radius 1 inch, creating three distinct regions: one region that’s shared between the two circles, and two regions that are part of one circle, but not the other.
Because the Riddler Express™ card is for the mathematically inclined, its parent company has issued a corporate mandate regarding symmetry. In particular, the areas of all three regions must be exactly the same. If that’s the case, how far apart must the centers of the two circles be?
Extra Credit: If you symmetrically arrange three circles of radius 1, you have seven distinct regions. How far apart should the centers of the circles be such that the areas of the largest and smallest of the seven regions are as close to equivalent as possible?

Riddler Classic
This week’s Riddler Classic is a cycling-themed puzzle of teamwork and strategy.
You are the coach for Team Riddler at the Tour de FiveThirtyEight, where there are 20 teams (including yours). Your objective is to win the Team Time Trial race, which has the following rules:
Each team rides as a group throughout the course at some fixed pace, specified by that team’s coach. Teams that can’t maintain their pace are said to have “cracked,” and don’t finish the course.
The team that finishes the course with the fastest pace is declared the winner.
Teams ride the course one at a time. After each team completes its attempt, the next team quickly consults with its coach (who assigns a pace) and then begins its ride. Coaches are aware of the results of all previous teams when choosing their own team’s pace.
Assume that all teams are of equal ability: At any given pace, they have the exact same probability of cracking, and the faster the pace, the greater the probability of cracking. Teams’ chances of cracking are independent, and each team’s coach knows exactly what a team’s chances of cracking are for each pace.
Team Riddler is the first team to attempt the course. To maximize your chances of winning, what’s the probability that your team will finish the course? What’s the probability you’ll ultimately win?
Extra Credit: If Team Riddler is the last team to attempt the course (rather than the first), what are its chances of victory?

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏Adam Opalski 👏 of Warsaw, Poland, winner of last week’s Riddler Express.
Last week, Dakota Jones was close to finding the Lost Arc, a geometric antiquity buried deep in the sands of Egypt. Along the way, she discovered a “highly symmetric crystal” that was needed to precisely locate the Arc. Dakota, now missing, had measured the crystal using her laser scanner, which produced the following looping animation:
What sort of three-dimensional shape is the crystal?
Solver Daniel Thompson took an impressively direct approach: he decomposed the animation into more than 300 separate images, then stacked them on top of each other to produce the following three-dimensional view:
That is one cool-looking crystal!
Having consulted with Professor Jones, who recently resurfaced, I can confirm that the highly symmetric crystal is indeed a cube. To help visualize this, here’s the scan shown at a different angle, along with the cube’s outline:
The scan started at one of the corners of the cube and proceeded to the opposite corner along an internal diagonal. The cross-section starts out as a growing equilateral triangle, turns into a hexagon (becoming a regular hexagon halfway through the scan) and then becomes a shrinking equilateral triangle.
There’s an even more precise answer, though. You could get a similar looking scan for something that isn’t a cube, but what’s called a trigonal trapezohedron (of which a cube is a special case where all six faces happen to be squares). If the crystal were a trigonal trapezohedron, but one that was more stretched out than a cube, and the camera were taking pictures that were farther apart, it could result in the same scan.
Solver Tim Maddux was kind enough to create a paper replica of that trigonal trapezohedron for Dakota Jones:

At first, Tim’s replica appears to have 12 triangular faces. But upon careful inspection, pairs of triangles come together to form six rhombic faces — a trigonal trapezohedron. I’m sure Dakota Jones won’t mind using this paper replica instead of some fancy crystal, right?
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏Jake Bryant 👏 of Weymouth, Massachusetts, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic.
You were challenged to find the longest string of letters in which (1) every pair of consecutive letters is a two-letter abbreviation for a state, territory or freely associated state, and (2) no abbreviation occurs more than once. For example, Guam, Utah and Texas could be combined into the valid four-letter string GUTX. Another valid string would be ALAK (Alabama, Louisiana and Alaska), while ALAL (Alabama, Louisiana and Alabama) was invalid because it includes the same state, Alabama, twice.
This problem is, shall we say, challenging to solve by hand, so riddlers around the world turned to their computers for assistance. Our winner used a technique known as recursion, writing code that breaks the problem down into smaller and smaller pieces, solves those mini-problems and then puts them back together again. The longest string turns out to be 31 characters long, and is made up of 30 states and territories. Here’s the string Jake found: FMPWVINVASDCTNMNCOHIALAKSCARIDE. Each consecutive pair of letters is a state or territory, from FM (Federated States of Micronesia) through DE (Delaware).
But there’s more than one string that fits the bill. Solver Richard Guidry
went so far as to find 9,984 distinct solutions. Here are a few more:
FMNVIDCALAKSCOHINCTNMPWVARIASDE
FMNVINCARIDCOHIAKSCTNMPWVALASDE
FMNCTNMPWVINVAKSCARIDCOHIALASDE
FMPWVALAKSCOHIASDCTNCARINMNVIDE
FMPWVARIASDCTNCALAKSCOHINMNVIDE
Guidry even went the extra mile and included the three additional abbreviations used by the Armed Forces: AA, AE and AP. With this change, he found strings that are a whopping 34 characters long, such as FMNVIDCAALAKSCOHINCTNMPWVAPARIASDE. It would seem that all roads lead to Delaware!
Solver Jason Ash, meanwhile, recognized the connection between this problem and graph theory, a branch of mathematics. As he describes, he treats each abbreviation as a node, and if one abbreviation’s second letter is the same as another abbreviation’s first letter, then they’re connected (in a mathematical sense, rather than a geographical sense). Here’s the resulting graph:
He then tried to find the longest path traversing the graph of connected states or territories, which is indeed 30 places, or 31 characters.
Alas, if only it were possible to connect all the states using their abbreviations. Maybe we can convince Kentucky, New York or Arizona to change their abbreviations. You know, for the sake of connected graphs.

On Friday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ended his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination — leaving us now with 18 major candidates remaining, per FiveThirtyEight’s definition.
However, the list of candidates with realistic shots at winning the nomination may be even shorter than that; just 10 candidates met the polling and donor thresholds to participate in last week’s Democratic debate in Houston. And de Blasio was not among them, nor did it seem possible for him to qualify for the next debate, in Ohio in October. As of July, only 6,700 people had donated to his campaign (debaters need 130,000), and he has only hit 2 percent support in a handful of polls all year long (none of which are counted by the Democratic National Committee for debate qualification). In short, it’s no mystery why de Blasio called it quits.
De Blasio was always an extreme long shot. He entered the race quite late, on May 16 — after more than 20 other major candidates had declared and the field was already drawing headlines for being historically saturated. In fact, only one successful presidential nominee since 1976 (Bill Clinton) kicked off his campaign later than de Blasio did. And although de Blasio was arguably one of the most progressive candidates in the field — having brought universal pre-K and other liberal reforms to the five boroughs — he was crowded out of the primary’s left lane by the likes of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who combined for 56 percent support among “very liberal” voters in the most recent Quinnipiac poll (de Blasio had less than 1 percent).
But probably de Blasio’s biggest problem was simply that Democratic voters did not like him,2 which is quite an unusual place to be among voters of one’s own party. In an average of national polls of 2020 candidates’ favorability from May, de Blasio was the only candidate at the time whom more voters viewed unfavorably than favorably (his net favorability rating — favorable rating minus unfavorable rating — was -1). That’s especially bad because de Blasio wasn’t some little-known candidate; 46 percent of Democrats were able to form an opinion of him. All other candidates who were at least as well-known had net favorability ratings of +21 or better!
It is very difficult to win a presidential nomination when you are well-known but not well-liked among voters in your party early in the campaign. Only one candidate has done so since 1980 — President Trump, who went from a -42 net favorability rating among Republicans in May 2015 to a +28 net favorability rating that September. But Trump had the advantage of tons of earned media coverage, something no future candidate could bank on. De Blasio certainly didn’t get it, appearing in less than 1 percent of cable-news clips the week of Sept. 8, for example. And unsurprisingly, his net favorability rating failed to improve; in fact, it actually dropped over the course of the campaign (it was -6 in our average of August polls).
One group with whom de Blasio became especially unpopular this summer? His own constituents. According to the Siena College Research Institute, de Blasio’s net favorability rating in New York City dropped from -1 point in March to -25 points in September. And there has been a lot of grumbling among New Yorkers about all the time de Blasio was spending out of state — such as when a blackout struck Manhattan and the mayor was campaigning in Iowa, or reports that de Blasio spent just seven hours at City Hall during the month of May.
Although term limits prevent de Blasio from seeking another term as mayor, his doomed presidential campaign may have drained whatever political capital he had remaining in his last two years as mayor. And although running for president is often portrayed as a risk-free way for politicians to build a national profile, de Blasio’s campaign is a cautionary tale that there can be major downsides as well.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-utahs-new-look-offense-lead-the-pac-12-back-to-the-playoff/,2019-09-20,,,features,"Sep. 20, 2019",Can Utah’s New-Look Offense Lead The Pac-12 Back To The Playoff?,Josh Planos,FiveThirtyEight,College Football,"The most realistic shot for the “Conference of Champions” to break its College Football Playoff drought rests on the shoulders of one of its newest and most unproven members. It falls on a coach who traditionally oversees .500 ball once the regular season passes the midway point and on a quarterback whose last two seasons have been derailed by upper-body injuries.
And with the Pac-12 Conference’s preeminent powers having already lost, Utah is perhaps the last team standing between the conference and a third consecutive season of missing the playoff.
But contrary to what the school’s trophy case might indicate, Utah is now more than just a powerhouse on the slopes. The Utes’ football team has made a convincing case to be taken seriously so far this season: They have three wins, with each decided by at least three possessions.1 Kyle Whittingham’s 15th full season at the helm in Salt Lake City opened with unprecedented expectations: They were ranked in the preseason top 15 for the first time, picked by the media and oddsmakers to win the Pac-12 and even deemed a national title contender by the lovably eccentric Lee Corso. And the prognostications were for good reason, too: Utah returns more than half of its starters on each side of the ball and features arguably the best defensive line in the nation. As Stanford coach David Shaw candidly put it at Pac-12 Football Media Day, “I think it’s great they’re not on the schedule for us this year.”
The program’s trajectory has reached an inflection point in recent years. From 1950 through 2013, Utah managed to crack the Associated Press Top 25 poll in just seven seasons. This year marks the sixth consecutive that the Utes have barreled into the top 20.
Since joining the Pac-12 eight years ago, the Utes have finished each season with a defense more efficient than its offense.2 The team’s average defensive efficiency over that time (73.3) grades out as tops among all defenses in the conference, while its offense (46.9) grades out as the second worst. This season, the two are within 2 points of each other, as the Utes feature a smashmouth offense that has vaulted the program onto the national scene.

In a conference marketed by speed and governed by spread offensive principles, Utah has been as deliberate as it gets. That’s the work of offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Andy Ludwig, who returned to Salt Lake City this offseason after previously serving in the former role from 2005 to 2008.3 Like many coordinators, Ludwig adapts his system to the personnel on hand. This season, that flexibility has arguably produced the kind of offense that, according to Utah backup quarterback Jason Shelley, will “smash you right in the face.”
Last season, Utah huddled on just 60.7 percent of snaps. Two seasons ago, only 27.5 percent of offensive plays involved that traditional gathering. But this year, Ludwig has the Utes huddling before 98.4 percent of plays, a rate outpaced by only a handful of teams. The Pac-12 averages a huddle rate of 52.2 percent, with six teams opting to huddle on less than 40 percent of snaps. In turn, Utah has gone almost entirely under center. While Arizona, Oregon and Washington State have used just two under-center snaps this season combined, Utah has racked up 78. By average time of possession per play and per drive, this is easily Utah’s slowest offensive cadence in at least 15 years — and it’s on pace to be the slowest Pac-12 offense over that same stretch.

And it’s working. Since 2005, only once has Utah had a more efficient start to the season offensively. Trailing only Mike Leach’s perennially magnificent Air Raid at Washington State, Ludwig oversees the conference’s second-best offense, which ranks in the top 25 nationally in expected points added on passes a season after it finished 96th. If maintained, the Utes’ 2.59 points per drive would be their best mark since 2008, when they went undefeated.
Starting quarterback Tyler Huntley reportedly spent the offseason packing on 25 pounds. Armed with a new physique, the senior leads the country in adjusted completion percentage (90), ranks fifth in yards per pass attempt (11.2) and is 12th in QBR (85.4). He hasn’t thrown an interception or been sacked.4 He has help in the backfield from Zack Moss, who is coming off consecutive 1,000-yard campaigns. Moss has accumulated more yards after first contact this season than all but two players in college football and will likely leave as the school’s all-time leading rusher.

— Utah Athletics (@utahathletics) September 7, 2019

These team performances have come via an abridged playbook. “Ludwig has done a very good job of just keeping things really basic,” Moss said after the Utes thrashed Idaho State. “We’ve just been running the first couple installs we did going into this year. If you can win with your basic stuff, that’s really good for your offense.”
Friday’s matchup at USC presents an opportunity for the Utes to allay fears that the moment will grow too big for them. It would mark a historic victory for Utah, which hasn’t beaten the Trojans in Los Angeles since 1916 (though in only nine attempts). Since arriving in the Pac-12 in 2011, Utah has never shown the flash of Oregon or the imagination of Washington State. It has even found itself in the shadow of Stanford, another program that bucks conference norms behind a conservative, play clock-drowning style. So it’s fitting that Utah, a program conventionally known for a stout defensive front, is gunning for contention behind an old face and a new offensive blueprint.

The Rays went to the World Series that season and made the playoffs in three of the five years that followed, creating a blueprint for other teams hoping to win on similarly microscopic budgets. Even this year, the Rays sit 10th in our Elo team rankings despite ranking 30th in payroll.
But for all of those wins, Tampa Bay has had some lousy luck in actually getting to the playoffs. The Rays have made only three postseason appearances this decade — and none since 2013. Only three teams in the expanded wild-card era (since 2012) have won 90 games but failed to play in the postseason: One of those was the 2013 Texas Rangers; the other two were Rays clubs, in 2012 and 2018. And this year’s team, on pace for 95 wins, has just a 54 percent chance of making the playoffs, according to the FiveThirtyEight model. What do the Rays have to do to get some postseason love around here?
Some of Tampa’s troubles simply have to do with playing in the cutthroat American League East, where the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox are together currently spending more than twice as much on players as the rest of the division combined. Whether in terms of the average victories necessary to win the division or even just the bare-minimum requirement, those numbers have consistently been higher for the AL East than any other division in baseball this decade:

In every division except the AL East and NL West, a 90-win team has had at least had some chance to come out in first place this decade. But in the AL East, no fewer than 93 wins have been required to win the division, and seldom fewer than 91 have been needed to make the playoffs, period.1 By my accounting,2 being in the AL East makes it 8 percentage points tougher for a 90-win team to make the playoffs than being in another division would make it, 10 percentage points tougher for an 89-win team and 12 percentage points tougher for an 88-win team.
That sweet spot around 90 wins happens to be where Tampa tends to often find itself, and it’s tough to make the playoffs from that zone when you’re in the AL East. Last year was a great example: The Rays went 90-72 but were precluded from winning the division (the Red Sox won 108 games) or even finishing in second place (the Yankees won 100 on the number). That left only one solitary playoff spot even up for the Rays to battle for, and it was snapped up by the 97-win Oakland Athletics. Baseball’s seventh-best team by wins above replacement,3 sporting a record that would normally earn a playoff slot 81 percent of the time in the double-wild-card era,4 ended up missing the playoffs by seven whole games.
But the Rays have found ways to miss the playoffs even when the Yankee/Red Sox hegemony was partially broken. Back in 2012, New York was good (95 wins) but hardly dominant, and Boston deteriorated completely under the not-so-watchful eye of Bobby Valentine, going 69-93. Meanwhile Tampa Bay had the fourth-most WAR in baseball, led by star seasons from Ben Zobrist (5.7 WAR) and David Price (5.5), plus solid years via players ranging from the expected (James Shields, Evan Longoria) to the out-of-nowhere (Jeff Keppinger??). By WAR, that was one of the most talented teams the Rays have ever produced. But they underperformed relative to the record their underlying stats say they “should” have had — according to BaseRuns, they should have made the playoffs with a 95-67 mark — wasting a red-hot 36-22 finish over the last two months of the season to end up three games shy of Texas and Baltimore for the wild card.
The disappointing Red Sox will miss the playoffs this season as well, possibly finishing as many as 10 games behind the rival Rays. Although the Yankees have dominated this season, tracking for 105 wins, you would think 95 wins could at least buy the Rays a wild-card appearance, in a wide-open year with Boston out of the picture.
And yet, here Tampa Bay is again, fighting for its playoff life on a nightly basis over the final few weeks of the season. Once again, the Oakland A’s — in many ways the West Coast mirror image of the Rays — are almost assured of one wild-card slot, putting themselves on pace for 97 wins by season’s end. And after the Minnesota Twins unexpectedly dominated the AL Central race, the Cleveland Indians’ only playoff hopes essentially rest on the same wild-card spot Tampa Bay has been eyeing all season. In the mega-top-heavy AL, one misfortunate team could win 95 games and still miss the playoffs entirely.5
If that team ends up being Tampa, it would obscure what has been maybe the most quintessentially Rays-y season of them all, in terms of doing more with less. The team’s best player by WAR (with 5.1) has been pitcher Charlie Morton, who had 1.5 career WAR to his name before joining the Astros in 2017; he is easily obliterating his previous career-best WAR (3.2 in 2018) this season at age 35. Left fielder Tommy Pham (3.9 WAR) had previously displayed his talent with 6.2 WAR in 2017, and shortstop Willy Adames had up-and-coming star potential. But the rest of Tampa Bay’s expected stars — such as pitcher Blake Snell and center fielder Kevin Kiermaier — have been merely OK, if also injured and/or underwhelming.
Instead, the Rays have succeeded with a mishmash of acquired prospects (Austin Meadows, Tyler Glasnow), unheralded youngsters (Brandon Lowe), seemingly random pitchers (Ryan Yarbrough, Yonny Chirinos, Emilio Pagan), retread veterans (Travis d’Arnaud) and other spare parts. They still use the opener, still shift a ton and still play relievers in the field before putting them back on the mound. They’ve fought through key injuries to rank fifth in the league in WAR per game, and through Sunday they were tracking to become just the eighth team since the 1994 strike to rank among MLB’s top 11 in WAR from every phase of the game — hitting, fielding, base-running and pitching (both starting and relieving):6

(Fittingly, the 2008 Rays — the team that started it all — are also in that club.)
If Tampa Bay does end up missing the playoffs, it would go down as one of the best teams ever to fit that criteria. Its current Elo rating of 1543 would tie last year’s Rays for the second-best among nonplayoff teams of the double-wild-card era (trailing only the 2012 Rays), and its 0.303 WAR per game would easily be the highest of any nonplayoff team since 2012. The last team to miss the postseason with as many WAR per game was the 2011 Red Sox, who fumbled away their playoff hopes with one of the most infamous collapses in baseball history.
But if the baseball gods know what they’re doing, they would maybe consider giving the Rays a break this time around. The franchise has already seen several of the hardest-luck nonplayoff seasons in recent history — and this year’s might be the cruelest postseason snub of all, given how many wins the Rays might rack up in vain. After so many years spent knocking on the door with records that usually belong in the postseason, it seems like it’s time Tampa finally gets in.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-christian-right-is-helping-drive-liberals-away-from-religion/,2019-09-19,,,features,"Sep. 18, 2019",The Christian Right Is Helping Drive Liberals Away From Religion,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,FiveThirtyEight,Religion,"A few weeks ago, the Democratic National Committee formally acknowledged what has been evident for quite some time: Nonreligious voters are a critical part of the party’s base. In a one-page resolution passed at its annual summer meeting, the DNC called on Democratic politicians to recognize and celebrate the contributions of nonreligious Americans, who make up one-third of Democrats. In response, Robert Jeffress, a Dallas pastor with close ties to Trump, appeared on Fox News, saying the Democrats were finally admitting they are a “godless party.”
This was hardly a new argument. Conservative Christian leaders have been repeating some version of this claim for years, and have often called on religious conservatives and Republican politicians to defend the country against a growing wave of liberal secularism. And it’s true that liberals have been leaving organized religion in high numbers over the past few decades. But blaming the Democrats, as Jeffress and others are wont to do, doesn’t capture the profound role that conservative Christian activists have played in transforming the country’s religious landscape, and the role they appear to have played in liberals’ rejection of organized religion.
Researchers haven’t found a comprehensive explanation for why the number of religiously unaffiliated Americans has increased over the past few years — the shift is too large and too complex. But a recent swell of social science research suggests that even if politics wasn’t the sole culprit, it was an important contributor. “Politics can drive whether you identify with a faith, how strongly you identify with that faith, and how religious you are,” said Michele Margolis, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “From Politics to the Pews: How Partisanship and the Political Environment Shape Religious Identity.” “And some people on the left are falling away from religion because they see it as so wrapped up with Republican politics.”
Liberal Americans are less religious than they used to be
Over the course of a single generation, the country has gotten a lot less religious. As recently as the early 1990s, less than 10 percent of Americans lacked a formal religious affiliation, and liberals weren’t all that much likelier to be nonreligious than the public overall. Today, however, nearly one in four Americans are religiously unaffiliated. That includes almost 40 percent of liberals — up from 12 percent in 1990, according to the 2018 General Social Survey.1 The share of conservatives and moderates who have no religion, meanwhile, has risen less dramatically.
The result is that today, most people’s political ideology is more tightly tethered to their religious identity. The overlap is far from complete — there are still some secular conservatives and even more religious liberals. In fact, the majority of Democratic voters are religiously affiliated. But the more liberal you are, the less likely you are to belong to a faith; whereas if you’re conservative, you’re more likely to say you’re religious.
To be sure, religious belief and practice can still exist without a label. Many people who are religiously unaffiliated still believe in God, or slip back into the pews a few times a year. But liberals are also cutting ties with religious institutions — since 1990, the share of liberals who never attend religious services has tripled. And they’re less likely to believe in God: The percentage of liberals who say they know God exists fell from 53 percent in 1991 to 36 percent in 2018.
Politics is shaping how some liberals think about religion
At first, it wasn’t clear why so many Americans were losing their faith — and of the available explanations, politics wasn’t high on the list. After all, there are lots of reasons why any individual person would stop attending church that have nothing to do with politics. A church scandal might spark a crisis of faith. You might begin to view a religion’s hierarchies or rules as antiquated, restrictive or irrelevant to your life. You might not have been that religious to begin with.
Social scientists were initially reluctant to entertain the idea that a political backlash was somehow responsible, because it challenged long-standing assumptions about how flexible our religious identities really are. Even now, the idea that partisanship could shape something as personal and profound as our relationship with God might seem radical, or maybe even a little offensive.
But when two sociologists, Michael Hout and Claude Fischer, began to look at possible explanations for why so many Americans were suddenly becoming secular, those conventional reasons couldn’t explain why religious affiliation started to fall in the mid-1990s. Demographic and generational shifts also couldn’t fully account for why liberals and moderates were leaving in larger numbers than conservatives. In a paper published in 2002, they offered a new theory: Distaste for the Christian right’s involvement with politics was prompting some left-leaning Americans to walk away from religion.
It was a simple but compelling explanation. For one thing, the timing made sense. In the 1990s, white evangelical Protestants were becoming more politically powerful and visible within conservative politics. As white evangelical Protestants became an increasingly important constituency for the GOP, the Christian conservative political agenda — focused primarily on issues of sexual morality, including opposition to gay marriage and abortion — became an integral part of the the party’s pitch to voters, but it was still framed as part of an existential struggle to protect the country’s religious foundation from incursions by the secular left. Hout and Fischer argued that the Christian right hadn’t just roused religious voters from their political slumber — left-leaning people with weaker religious ties also started opting out of religion because they disliked Christian conservatives’ social agenda.
At the time, Hout and Fischer’s argument was mostly just a theory. But within the past few years, Margolis and several other prominent political scientists have concluded that politics is a driving factor behind the rise of the religiously unaffiliated. For one thing, several studies that followed respondents over time showed that it wasn’t that people were generally becoming more secular, and then gravitating toward liberal politics because it fit with their new religious identity. People’s political identities remained constant as their religious affiliation shifted.
Other research showed that the blend of religious activism and Republican politics likely played a significant role in increasing the number of religiously unaffiliated people. One study, for instance, found that something as simple as reading a news story about a Republican who spoke in a church could actually prompt some Democrats to say they were nonreligious. “It’s like an allergic reaction to the mixture of Republican politics and religion,” said David Campbell, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame and one of the study’s co-authors.
Granted, the people who were leaving weren’t necessarily at the center of their religious community — they didn’t attend religious services often, perhaps dropping in once or twice a year. But the numbers began to add up, opening a rift between conservatives and liberals. According to Margolis’s research, while young people across the political spectrum tend to drift away from religion, liberals are increasingly unlikely to return.
Liberals seem likely to become increasingly secular
As a result, views about religion and its role in American society have become increasingly polarized. According to surveys by the Pew Research Center, the percentage of liberals who believe that churches and religious organizations positively contribute to society dropped from nearly half (49 percent) in 2010 to only one-third (33 percent) today. And according to 2016 data from the Voter Study Group, only 11 percent of people who are very liberal say that being Christian is at least fairly important to what it means to be American — compared to 69 percent of people who identify as very conservative.
And although the people who have left religion could return, it seems more and more unlikely. For one thing, conservative Christians are still a key part of the Republican coalition, where their agenda on issues like abortion and religious exemptions remains a high political priority within the party. This means liberals’ views of the association between conservative politics and religion could be hard to shake.
These patterns are self-reinforcing in other ways, too. Recent surveys show that secular liberals are more likely than moderates or conservatives to have spouses who aren’t religious. That’s critical because these couples are then often less likely to pray or send their children to Sunday school, and research shows that formative religious experiences as a child play a crucial role in structuring an adult’s religious beliefs and identity. It’s no coincidence then that the youngest liberals — who never lived in a political world before the Christian right — are also the most secular. “It’s very, very unlikely that a kid raised in a nonreligious liberal household would suddenly consider going to church,” Margolis said.
The political implications of this shift are already evident. As more liberals become nonreligious, the Democratic Party’s base is growing more secular, complicating the party’s efforts at reaching more religious voters. But what it means for religion is less clear. Paul Djupe, a political scientist at Denison College, said that the impact might be blunted by the fact that the people who are becoming nonreligious mostly weren’t that involved in religion to begin with.
But Campbell warned that this shift is already reducing churches’ ability to bring a diverse array of people together and break down partisan barriers. That, in his view, threatens to further undermine trust in religious groups and make our politics more and more divisive. “We have very few institutions left in the country where people who have different political views come together,” he said. “Worship was one of those — and without it, the list is smaller and smaller.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

After all, we live in a politically polarized era where most presidential elections are decided by relatively narrow margins (since 1988, in the single digits). Which means if the margins are as slim as they were in 2016, the race could come down to swing voters, or voters that tend to switch their support between the two major parties from year to year.
So we were curious: Just how many swing voters are there? A number of researchers have tried to tackle this question, and it turns out, there’s a pretty big range of answers.
That’s because defining who is and isn’t a swing voter isn’t easy, as it’s a small group. But estimates I previously made based on a couple of data sets suggest that there were around 10 million voters who shifted from voting for one major party in 2012 to the other in 2016, which accounted for roughly 7 percent of all votes cast. In the grand scheme of things, that’s not a lot of people, but these voters probably did play a role in helping President Trump get elected because around three-quarters of those voters swung toward him rather than Hillary Clinton.
One way to get at this question is to use the approach of Northeastern University political scientist William Mayer, who wrote a 2008 book on the subject. To identify swing voters, Mayer used a set of questions from the American National Election Studies that asked respondents before the election to rate their feelings toward the candidates in terms of degrees (like a thermometer scale), with 0 being very negative and 100 being very positive. Mayer then looked at how respondents actually voted. Unsurprisingly, someone who rated the Republican 100 degrees better than the Democrat was basically certain to vote for the Republican, and vice versa. But Mayer also found that people who had similar feelings about both candidates were also the swingiest — the voters most likely to switch which party they supported typically rated the candidates no more than 15 degrees apart.
So if we apply Mayer’s methodology to the electorate in 2016, voters who rated Trump and Clinton within 15 degrees of each other in the ANES survey made up 9 percent of voters for the two major parties.1 To be clear, that doesn’t mean every one of these voters switched their support, but in Mayer’s view, this was the group of voters most open to persuasion by the campaigns. So even if there is evidence that the overall number of swing voters is declining, we’re still talking about at least a tenth of the electorate who might be willing to switch parties — and the fact that they broke for Trump in 2016 mattered.

Respondents were asked to rate candidates on a scale of 0 degrees to 100 degrees, like a thermometer, with 0 being very negative and 100 being very positive. The difference in candidate ratings is simply the size of the gap between those ratings for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This analysis is limited to respondents who voted for one of the two major parties.

However, some political scientists, like Corwin Smidt, who studies vote choice at Michigan State, argue that the percentage of swing voters is, in fact, much lower and in decline — he estimated just 6 percent of all Americans voted for a different party in 2016 than the one they backed in 2012. Smidt uses a much narrower definition of what a swing voter is — someone who consistently votes, but switches back and forth between the two major parties.2 In other words, he excludes people who only occasionally vote, even if they don’t identify strongly with one party.
But what if you include more casual voters? Could the number of swing voters in the U.S. be much higher? A new study from the Kaiser Family Foundation certainly seems to suggest that’s the case, classifying 30 percent of registered voters as swing voters. Why is KFF’s number so much higher than our estimates using Mayer’s or Smidt’s approach? For one thing, KFF is trying to account for people who might not always vote but could turn out if motivated. Part of the problem with understanding just how many swing voters exist is that many potential voters don’t consistently turn out. They may vote only once in a while (what Smidt calls “surge and decliners”) or they may not vote at all (what Smidt calls “repeat nonvoters.”) KFF tries to capture some of this in its polling — 24 percent of its swing voters didn’t vote in the 2016 election, or about 7 percent of their overall sample.3
However, the number of truly persuadable voters is probably much smaller than the 30 percent top-line number in KFF’s report — just 16 percent of all voters told KFF either that they were undecided or that there was “a chance” they might vote for the other party’s candidate. As for the other 14 percent of respondents who were classified as swing voters, they said they were probably going to vote for one party and would not vote for the other side — but they also said they might not vote, period. This suggests that many off-and-on voters aren’t actually that “swingy” in their voting preferences. In his research, Smidt found that rates of swing voting among these more intermittent voters had also declined, telling FiveThirtyEight that, “Polarization makes party differences so clear to even non-voters or sporadic voters that the potential swing they could provide in an election is shrinking.”
So while not all 30 percent of the registered voters who KFF grouped into its “swing voters” category are actually open to being convinced by a good campaign, its polling does suggest that if turnout increases in 2020, there could be more swing voters than in 2016, since some of them spent the last presidential election cycle on the sidelines. As for who these voters might swing toward, KFF found that, on average, these voters were younger, less partisan and more moderate than voters who have already made up their minds. Additionally, they’re less politically engaged, with about one-third saying it “doesn’t matter” or “somewhat matters” who wins in 2020. This is in stark contrast to the more than 90 percent of decided voters who said that it “really matters” who wins. Notably, KFF’s data also found that swing voters were slightly more likely to identify as Republican or Republican-leaning than Democratic or Democratic-leaning, which is different from people who are not registered to vote, who tend to lean Democratic. (People who aren’t registered to vote also tend to be young, but are more likely to be nonwhite than KFF’s swing voters.) Still, Trump’s net approval rating among these voters was negative — 44 percent approved of his job performance compared to 53 percent who disapproved — so it’s not entirely clear which way the bulk of these voters might swing.
And of course, it is the Electoral College that decides presidential elections, not the popular vote, so where swing voters are based geographically can have huge electoral consequences. Catalist, a Democratic data firm, recently found that the shifts in vote margin from 2012 to 2016 in many swing states were predominantly driven by changes in vote choice rather than changes in turnout. According to their analysis, the change in vote margin in the three key states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin could mostly be explained by people shifting which party they voted for, rather than by changes in turnout. On the other hand, using data from the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a large nationwide survey that focuses on respondents’ political attitudes, other researchers have suggested that depressed voter turnout or votes for third-party candidates could also explain a big part of the national swing toward the GOP. So while estimating the number of swing voters is challenging — and the number will vary depending on what data and definitions you use — the importance of swing voters should not be understated. How they swing in 2020 could make all the difference.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

At least $184,000
Some Air Force crew members are getting nice, Trump-owned digs abroad. Since 2017, the Pentagon has reportedly spent at least $184,000 at Trump’s Scottish Turnberry resort. The bulk of the cost has gone to accommodations for several dozen flight crews making refueling stops. In the previous two years, the Defense Department spent far less at Trump Turnberry: $64,380.

More than $100,000 in donations
It started with a plea for beer money. Carson King attended an ESPN College GameDay rally in Iowa with a sign that read: “Busch Light Supply Needs Replenished” and listed his Venmo account. When a lot of money started coming his way, King pledged to buy one case of beer and donate the rest to the University of Iowa’s children’s hospital. After matching donations by both Busch Light and Venmo, the hospital will receive more than $100,000. Not all heroes wear capes — some just want a cold Busch Light. [Des Moines Register]

Heading into the 2019 season, the NFL competition committee mandated that referees enforce offensive holding more strictly than they have in the past. The points of emphasis document published by the NFL states that “back-side” holding — action that occurs behind where the ball carrier is running — will be more closely monitored.
A play from the Cleveland Browns’ and the Tennessee Titans’ matchup in Week 1 helps illustrate what the NFL is trying to prevent. The play shown below is a counter run to the left, away from the “strong” side of the offensive line. The idea is to fool the defense into thinking that because there’s an extra blocker to the right,2 you’ll run that direction. To help sell the deception, Cleveland running back Nick Chubb takes a false step toward the right and then quickly cuts across the field in front of the quarterback and heads left, looking for a hole.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/holding.mp4
Chubb ends up finding some room to run, but only because the majority of his linemen were breaking the rules. While the actions of No. 85 David Njoku best match the description of backside holding, the referee probably could have thrown flags for a number of penalties on this run. There’s an old saying in football that you can call holding on any play, and officials now appear to want to. Refs are calling these fouls at a rate that is unprecedented in recent NFL history.

Offensive holding penalties in the first two weeks of the season rose 78 percent this year, from 82 in 2018 to 146 in 2019. If the current rate of holding penalties called continues over the course of the entire year, we might wonder: Are there winners or losers from the new rule emphasis?
If we look at the number of holding penalties called on each NFL team year-over-year since 2009, there is some evidence indicating that teams take a portion of their holding penalties with them from one season to the next.3 Teams with many holding penalties called on them in 2018 — such as Washington, Cleveland, Tampa Bay, Denver and Indianapolis — might be negatively impacted by the new rule emphasis the most.

Meanwhile, teams such as Chicago, the L.A. Rams, Pittsburgh and San Francisco were largely able to avoid holding penalties last season and may be in better shape than others if they continue their by-the-book performances.4
Of course, it could also be the case that all teams will be similarly affected by the increased number of holding calls. The year-to-year stability of the penalty at the team level isn’t terribly strong, and the league is now cracking down on a very specific type of holding. But even if the increase in holding calls is relatively constant across the league, there may be another way for teams to gain an edge in light of the new rules emphasis.
It turns out that holding is more likely to be called on a running play. From 2009 to 2018, holding was called on 2636 rushing attempts and 1673 passing attempts,5despite the fact that the majority of plays over that period were passes. Since 61.2 percent of holding calls on these plays occur when rushing, it suggests that running is more risky, and therefore less valuable.
NFL teams hardly need further incentive to call more pass plays, but nevertheless, here is potentially another reason to move away from the run game. Teams that pass more often than they run would stand to benefit the most from the new emphasis on back-side holding. Perhaps the officials will do what analysts have been unable to do all these years; that is, finally convince the NFL to reevaluate the frequency with which they run the ball.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Twenty-four major-conference teams (so, the Power Five plus Notre Dame — more on the Irish later) are currently undefeated, and 29 more have only one loss. Although we may be headed for yet another Clemson-versus-Alabama rematch in the national title game, that’s not set in stone … yet.
To help make sense of the postseason picture from this early stage of the season onward, we built a model that predicts every team’s chance of making the playoff and winning the national championship. You can read more about how it works here — and we’ve made some tweaks this year — or scroll on to see the current rankings and how they might change going forward.
The usual suspects are indeed at the top of this year’s projections as well, with Clemson, Alabama, Oklahoma, Ohio State and Georgia forming the top 5 most likely playoff teams. And yes, the two most likely championship-game contestants are — you guessed it — Clemson (45 percent chance of making the title game) and Alabama (30 percent). Those odds imply that there is a 62 percent chance at least one of the Tigers and Crimson Tide make the playoff and a 14 percent chance we see yet another Clemson-Bama tilt in New Orleans next January.
But that means there’s an 86 percent chance we don’t get Swinney-versus-Saban Part IV in the national title game. It’s still a wide-open battle. Our model currently gives 40 teams at least a 1 percent chance to make the playoff, 30 teams at least a 1 percent chance of making the title game and 21 teams at least a 1 percent chance of winning it all.

*A team’s most dangerous opponent is the team on its remaining schedule with the highest probability of beating it, according to the FiveThirtyEight model.
The big change we’ve added to the model this season involves one of those teams: Notre Dame. We believe we were systematically underrating the Fighting Irish’s chances of making the playoff in past seasons — as evidenced by the paltry 62 percent CFP probability we gave them heading into selection day last year. (They ended up making it, while a team we gave better odds to — Ohio State at 69 percent — missed out.)
As an independent, Notre Dame was ineligible for the conference championship bonus in our model, which made its résumé look weaker in comparison with teams that had won their conferences. This year, however, we assign some fraction of the bonus to independents, based on their W-L record and how often the record tends to be enough to win a conference. That should help the Fighting Irish’s odds this year, provided they keep winning; if Notre Dame wins out, we give it a 97 percent chance of making the playoff.
Of course, the biggest obstacle to that comes this weekend, when Georgia — an intriguing dark horse championship pick — hosts the Irish in a game that our model gives UGA a 65 percent chance of winning. This is by far the most important game of Week 4 in college football, with nearly 40 total points of playoff probability (across all FBS teams) riding on the outcome of the contest:

Naturally, both UGA and Notre Dame would see their playoff odds rise by quite a bit with victories (and fall with losses). But an Irish win would shake things up most of all — Notre Dame’s chance of making the playoff will improve by about 27 percentage points if it wins, and UGA’s will fall by about 16 points. That’s a pretty huge impact for a game this early in the season.
But although UGA-Notre Dame is the biggest game of Week 4, most top contenders’ fates will potentially be sealed much later in the year. Among the top 5 teams in our championship odds, four of them (Clemson, Alabama, Ohio State and Oklahoma) face their highest remaining chance of losing any given regular-season game in Week 14 — the final weekend before conference championships. (And even Georgia faces its most dangerous remaining regular-season opponent in Week 12 at Auburn, not this weekend against Notre Dame, in large part because UGA is at home against the Irish.)
That means there will be plenty more drama to unfold as the season goes on. And you can use our playoff predictions to help follow it — and play with the implications of each game — every step along the way.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Is “cancel culture” coming for Justin Trudeau? The Canadian prime minister landed in hot water after Time reported that he wore brownface makeup to an “Arabian nights”-themed gala in 2001. The photo shows a 29-year-old Trudeau with his skin darkened, wearing a turban and robes. He has apologized for the incident, but also admitted to wearing blackface in high school to sing “Day-O,” a Jamaican folk song, in a talent show. “I shouldn’t have done that,” Trudeau said. “I should have known better and I didn’t. I’m really sorry.” [Time]
$100 million in aid
The State Department cut $100 million in aid money that was originally destined for Afghanistan. The move comes after failed attempts to bring the 18-year war to an end by making a deal with the Taliban. A written statement from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that “Afghan government corruption and financial mismanagement” contributed to the decision. The funds were meant for a hydroelectric project to provide power to two cities in southern and southeastern Afghanistan. The money will now be returned the Treasury. [The New York Times]
29 percent of birds
Birds are dying out in drastic numbers and humans are to blame, researchers say. Research published in the journal Science reveals there’s been a 29 percent population decline among birds in the U.S. and Canada since 1970. That’s a net loss of nearly 3 billion birds, scientists said. Most of the losses came from common species like sparrows, blackbirds and grackles. Researchers said that the loss of so many birds could upset a number of ecosystems, and while climate change was not the main reason for the decline, it will likely make things worse. [Reuters]
Nearly 2,500 schools
Forest fires in Indonesia are spewing toxic smoke into heavily populated areas. Nearly 2,500 Malaysian schools were ordered to suspend classes due to health concerns about the smog caused by the blazes, which have spun out of control. In Kuching, the air pollution was so intense that it rendered the Malaysian city one the most polluted areas in the world, according to the World Air Quality Index. Nearly 2 millions students are affected by the school closures in Malaysia. [Al Jazeera]
Area 51
There’s an invasion happening in the Nevada desert, but it’s just tourists. The tiny towns of Rachel and Hiko near the secretive military base are preparing for a rise in visitors due to an internet joke that sparked the “Storm Area 51” craze. A number of events are taking place this week in the region, prompting military warnings not to approach the protected site. The events are attracting people from all over the world — two Dutch tourists were arrested there last week. [Yahoo/Associated Press]

But this year, there might be a challenger to rivalry week’s throne: There may be no more pivotal slate of games this season than that of Week 10, with three games on the Nov. 3 docket with critical consequences for the College Football Playoff.
Our playoff model simulates every game of the season, extracting the likelihood of each outcome as well as the probability of every team to reach the final four. To help you prepare for Week 10, here are the games that matter most, as defined by their potential cumulative effect on the entire nation’s playoff chances.


No. 1 Alabama (8-0) at No. 3 LSU (7-1)
Favorite: Alabama (69.4 percent)Total potential CFP swing: 43.6 points
The stakes: With both programs having two weeks to prepare, the Crimson Tide and Tigers will clash in a matchup that has often decided the SEC West division. This year’s installment pits one of the best LSU defenses in recent years against potentially the best offense Alabama has ever fielded.
After losing to then-No. 22 Florida in Gainesville, LSU rebounded with consecutive wins over ranked opponents: a 36-16 disposal of then-No. 2 Georgia and a 19-3 thrashing of then-No. 22 Mississippi State. Four wins over ranked opponents charmed the College Football Playoff committee into putting the Tigers third in the first iteration of its rankings.1
Behind Heisman front-runner Tua Tagovailoa and offensive coordinator Mike Locksley’s run-pass option attack, Alabama’s point margin is plus-252 in first halves this season, nearly 100 points better than any other team, according to ESPN Stats & Information Group. In most seasons, it would be absurd to label a team as two-touchdown favorites against the third-ranked team in the nation, a team with a 1-in-5 chance of reaching the playoff — but that’s how good Alabama is. It’s been 21 years since LSU was this big of a home underdog.
Even though the Tide have been unquestionably the most dominant team this season, a loss would still hurt — dropping their likelihood of reaching the playoff by nearly 30 points. An LSU win would give the Tigers nearly coin-flip odds (49.8 percent) of reaching the playoff, and it would provide a bump for Georgia (from 32.2 percent to 35.9 percent) and Kentucky (from 6.8 percent to 8.1 percent) because it would likely mean that neither of those SEC East leaders would face Alabama in the conference championship game. Should Alabama win, the Tide’s odds of reaching the playoff would spike to 79 percent. A loss for LSU would drop the Tigers’ chances to 7.1 percent, effectively removing the team from contention.

No. 6 Georgia (7-1) at No. 9 Kentucky (7-1)
Favorite: Georgia (70.8 percent)Total potential CFP swing: 36 points
The stakes: For the better part of three decades, Kentucky has served as the doormat of the SEC East, while Georgia has routinely contended for conference championships. So while it’s no surprise that the loaded Bulldogs have a 1-in-3 chance of returning to the playoff, few preseason prognosticators would have guessed that the Wildcats would be relevant this late in the season. But here we are, with coach Mark Stoops crowd-surfing in locker rooms as his team rattles off victories. The winner of Saturday’s ground-and-pound clash is guaranteed a spot in the SEC title game.
Bulldogs quarterback Jake Fromm, who last season led Georgia to the national championship game as a true freshman, has withstood ample criticism and an eye-gouging in his sophomore campaign. As it stands, the Justin Fields experience is on hiatus. Across the field, Kentucky quarterback Terry Wilson is largely tasked with getting the ball to Benny Snell Jr. ad nauseam. The sophomore has attempted only 153 passes this season — one more than Tagovailoa, who largely sits the second half of games.
Saturday should be a blistering defensive fight. Kentucky has held seven consecutive opponents to fewer than 20 points, a feat last accomplished by the Wildcats nearly six decades ago. Both teams rank in the top 20 in opponent adjusted quarterback rating and in the top eight in defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information.
Whoever loses this game will see the near-annihilation of its playoff hopes: Kentucky’s odds would drop to 0.1 percent, and Georgia’s odds would drop to 2.1 percent. A win would improve the Wildcats’ odds to 16.2 percent, while Georgia’s odds would spike by 12.4 points to 44.5 percent. Kentucky toppling Georgia would greatly benefit just about every other team in the running: Alabama’s odds would jump to 73.2 percent, Notre Dame’s to 51.1 percent, Oklahoma’s to 36.7 percent, Ohio State’s to 25 percent and LSU’s to 22 percent.

No. 4 Notre Dame (8-0) at Northwestern (5-3)
Favorite: Notre Dame (70.7 percent)Total potential CFP swing: 31.4 points
The stakes: Few teams can challenge Northwestern for the national lead in inconsistency. The Wildcats have pirouetted to double-digit victories over two ranked opponents and come within fourth-quarter scoring drives of losses to upset-minded-but-inferior Nebraska and Rutgers. After dropping three of its first four games — including home losses to Duke and Akron — Northwestern responded by winning four straight Big Ten contests to occupy the driver’s seat of the Big Ten West.
Notre Dame has handled its business — and still had to watch as one-loss LSU was ranked ahead of it on Tuesday night. Through no fault of its own, Notre Dame’s victories over then-No. 7 Stanford and then-No. 24 Virginia Tech haven’t exactly aged well. Now under the guidance of dual-threat quarterback Ian Book, Notre Dame’s offense has improved substantially, and Brian Kelly is shepherding one of his top defenses since his arrival in 2010.
Considering that no team with three losses has qualified for the College Football Playoff in its four-year history, Northwestern faces long odds. But because of the imbalance in the Big Ten, the Wildcats have a clear path to the Big Ten championship and a resume-boosting opportunity to play a top-tier opponent, likely either Michigan or Ohio State, at the end of the season. So a loss this weekend would serve as a death knell, but a win keeps those slim hopes alive at 1.4 percent.
Every team on the outside looking in is pulling for Northwestern, who could provide a huge odds boost to the other contenders with a win. Notre Dame controls its destiny, with a win improving its odds to 61.1 percent. But a loss would drop the Irish’s chances to 23.3 percent, suggesting that even with only one loss, it would need serious help to maintain its spot in the top four.

In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew breaks down what we know about the winners and losers of last week’s debate and talks about how the race has changed — or hasn’t — as a result.
The team also discusses another primary race — the Republican primary. President Trump now has three challengers: Former congressman and South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, former Rep. Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. Considering the president’s high approval rating among Republicans, the crew debates whether any of the challengers will affect Trump’s chances.

20 miles of border fencing
President Trump’s border wall construction has hit a roadblock — again. The Defense Department will not move forward with three border wall projects in California and Arizona, citing “insufficient contract savings.” The move comes after Trump faced backlash for tapping into Pentagon funds to build part of the wall. A Monday court filing, however, reveals that there were not enough funds to cover the costs of these three projects. As of late August, about 60 miles of wall along the southern border had been updated. [CNN]
More than 150 countries
Swedish teen Greta Thunberg has become the face of a global movement to fight climate change, and on Friday, she and advocates in more than 150 countries will participate in the Global Climate Strike. In the U.S., the event is expected to draw thousands of strikers in New York City, Minneapolis, Denver and Washington, D.C., among others. This comes ahead of the U.N. Climate Action Summit, at which countries are supposed to offer concrete plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions. [Vox]
No. 33
A female athlete gets a big-time honor in Texas. The University of Texas will retire the jersey of basketball player Kamie Ethridge, who wore No. 33. This is the first time the university has done this for a female athlete. Ethridge lead Texas to the 1986 NCAA championship and won a gold medal for the U.S. at the 1988 Olympics. Her jersey will be retired during halftime of Saturday’s football game between Texas and LSU. [Associated Press/WTOP]
8 years of tax returns
The battle over President Trump’s tax returns is shaping up to be a never-ending saga. This week, state prosecutors in Manhattan subpoenaed eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns. The subpoena was issued shortly after the Manhattan district attorney’s office opened a criminal investigation into hush-money payments made leading up to the 2016 election. This subpoena is one of several attempts to obtain copies of the president’s tax returns, which the president said he would make public on the campaign trail. He has yet to do so. [The New York Times]
75 years old
ABC News journalist and political commentator Cokie Roberts has died at the age of 75. The veteran journalist began her career at NPR in 1978, where she established herself as a leading voice and pioneering woman in public broadcasting. She joined ABC in 1988. Roberts died Tuesday due to complications from breast cancer. [NPR]
40 percent of Democratic voters
Democrats really want to beat Trump. About 40 percent of respondents said after the third Democratic debate that a candidate’s ability to beat Trump was the most important factor in determining their primary vote. Eleven percent of voters listed health care as their top concern and about 9 percent said the economy. Former Vice President Biden scored better among voters who said beating Trump was their top priority than the broader respondent pool; however, Sen. Elizabeth Warren exited the debate with the highest overall numbers. [FiveThirtyEight]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/down-at-halftime-in-a-soccer-game-use-your-subs/,2019-09-18,,,features,"Sep. 18, 2019",Down At Halftime In A Soccer Game? Use Your Subs.,Tim Wigmore,FiveThirtyEight,Soccer,"It is halftime in a soccer game. One side is losing. Most of the time, that team’s manager decides to persist with the 11 players who started the match until well into the second half.
That lack of action actually damages the team’s prospects of making a comeback in the game. And despite the data that lays out a more prudent approach, holding on to substitutions remains commonplace in top level soccer. But it is also becoming less frequent.
Since Unai Emery became Arsenal manager at the start of the 2018-19 season, the Gunners have used all three of their substitutes in 41 out of 43 Premier League games — the third-most of any team. Under Emery, Arsenal typically makes its first substitution after 52 minutes — earlier than any other Premier League team last year. Emery’s halftime changes contrast with those of his predecessor, Arsène Wenger, who had his first substitution on average in the 60th minute from 2010 to 2018, according to the football consultancy 21st Club. In his first North London derby, at home against Tottenham in December, Emery took the unusual step of bringing on two substitutes at halftime, and both proved crucial in turning a 2-1 deficit into a 4-2 win.
Emery’s fondness for using all of his available substitutes is a snapshot of a broader change in the Premier League. The proportion of teams using all three substitutions rose from 73 percent in 2012-13 to 83 percent in 2018-19.
This rise has coincided with increased research into the potential advantages gained by teams that use their substitutions earlier. In 2012, Bret Myers, a professor at Villanova University as a professor who also works as an analytics consultant for the Columbus Crew of the MLS, published a paper based on an analysis of the top-tier leagues in England, Spain, Germany, Italy and the U.S. along with the 2010 World Cup. Myers found that if a team was losing, a manager should make the first substitution before the 58th minute, the second before the 73rd and the third before the 79th minute. The position of the substitutes didn’t matter. Additionally, if a team was ahead, the timing of its substitutes seemed to make little difference.
Teams that followed Myers’s approach to making substitutions improved their result in the match — narrowing their goal deficit — 42.3 percent of the time. Teams that did not follow his rule improved their performance only 20.5 percent of the time — so, from the same position in games, they were less than half as successful as the sides who followed this substitution pattern, and made all three substitutions before the times Myers advocated.
Players coming off the bench tend to be markedly more productive than the players they replace, as well as the players who stay on. On Statsbomb, Colin Trainor analyzed regular goalscorers in the Big Five European soccer leagues in the 2012-13 season and found that when players were substituted onto the field, they scored at comfortably the highest rate — 0.65 goals per 90 minutes — of the sample of 268 players. The rate was 50 percent more than for the players who were subbed off (0.42) and even more than for players who played the full 90 minutes (0.38). This implies not only that fresh players are significantly more likely to score than tired ones, but also that players are simply not as effective at scoring when they play the full match.
Sometimes, an element of pre-planning in substitutions may be advantageous. For instance, if forwards are told they are likely to be taken off at halftime, that may encourage them to run even more in the first half and pressure opposing defenders, rather than worrying about conserving their energy. “To turn substitutions into a proactive strategical decision rather than the reactive or habitual practice we see so often is certainly an area which teams should look to exploit,” said James Yorke, a senior analyst at StatsBomb. “The game gets ever faster, so prepping for a guy to give you all his running for 45 minutes… is just a logical idea to implement.”
Myers believes that managers don’t use their substitutions earlier because of defensive decision-making — and being too egotistical to admit their mistakes. “For the most part, the starting 11 is the perceived ‘best foot forward’ for the squad with respect to the matchup, so an early substitution is typically viewed as a plan B rather than a proactive plan A approach,” he said. “Managers also may fear backlash when pulling starters early who expect to play longer.”
Coaches might fear criticism that early substitutions, rather than being lauded as proactive, will amount to a tacit admission of their original error in picking their starting 11. After Liverpool’s manager, Jürgen Klopp, substituted a fresh Dejan Lovren following just 34 minutes of a game against Tottenham two years ago, The Times of London wrote that “Klopp must take blame for Liverpool’s comedy of errors,” and, “It comes to something when, with Liverpool 2-1 down after half an hour, Jürgen Klopp felt the need to substitute his £20 million central defender.” Managers also invite criticism if they use their third and final substitution relatively early and a player subsequently gets injured, meaning that their team will be forced to play the remainder of the match with only 10 players.
The economist John Maynard Keynes once observed that for your reputation, it’s better to “fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.” In such a volatile industry — the average manager in the top four divisions of English soccer lasts barely a year in each job — perhaps it is understandable that managers use their substitutes conservatively — in order to minimize criticism. But those with the courage to substitute earlier may stand to gain extra points for their team.

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Last Thursday, the 2020 Democratic candidates covered a wide range of topics during the three-hour debate, including health care, race and criminal justice, immigration, gun control and climate change.
But what issues do voters care most about? In our FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll, conducted using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, we surveyed the same set of respondents both before and after the debate to find out what issue was most important in determining their vote in the primary. And what we learned was Democrats are most concerned about defeating President Trump — nearly 40 percent of respondents said this was their top issue. For reference, the next-most-common top issue — health care — was picked by just 10 percent voters before the debate and 11 percent after.
So what issues should the candidates be talking more about? Less about? And if Democrats care more about winning this year, what’s the best way to talk about beating Trump?

From a survey of 4,320 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed between Sept. 5 and Sept. 11. The same people were surveyed again from Sept. 12 to Sept. 16; 3,473 responded to the second wave.
nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): Well, to state the obvious, the candidates should be talking about their ability to beat Trump.
It’s important to a ton of Democratic voters.
And the more it goes untalked-about, the more other candidates are ceding that ground to Joe Biden, IMO.
Electability is a very fuzzy concept without a ton of data behind it, so pretty much any candidate can make a plausible argument for their “electability.”
sarahf: What are some ways candidates can do that, though?
I know Biden has leaned into his performance in head-to-head polls against Trump, but as we know … general election polls don’t really tell us that much about the strength of candidates in the primary.
natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): I mean, it’s a little tricky. If you talk too much about electability, you raise the salience of the issue, which might work to Biden’s benefit.
ameliatd (Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, senior writer): On the other hand, the fact that electability is a fuzzy concept can also be difficult for the candidates to address directly — for example, the female candidates.
nrakich: Amelia, if you ask me, the female candidates should be trotting out the studies that show women do just as well as men when they run for office!
ameliatd: Well, but those studies aren’t about presidential candidates! Most political scientists agree that people don’t cross the aisle to vote against a woman (or for that matter, to vote for a woman) — party loyalties are stronger than gender bias. But that’s not an easy sound bite, and it also may not be especially reassuring to voters who think sexism was a factor in Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016.
natesilver: In particular, I think it’s risky (by which I mean dumb) for any candidate other than Biden to talk much about his or her head-to-head polls against Trump, because Biden still does better than any other Democrat in those polls by some margin.
sarahf: But is that what will convince voters someone is electable?
nrakich: Amy Klobuchar is pointing to her past election results, where she really ran up the score in the swing state of Minnesota, as evidence that she’s electable. The problem is that she just hasn’t gotten a lot of attention for it (although voters in our poll thought she was slightly more likely to beat Trump after the debate).
sarahf: How else can candidates talk about their ability to defeat Trump without getting into their performance in head-to-head polls?
natesilver: I thought Warren’s response to Delaney in the second debate was good. Basically, like, if you’re not running on ideas, then why are you even running?
nrakich: If you’re Klobuchar, you can also argue that a moderate candidate is better positioned to win over swing voters. Or if you’re Kamala Harris or Cory Booker, you can argue that a black candidate will have the most success increasing black turnout (which could help Democrats win back Midwestern states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and might put new states, like Georgia, in play).
natesilver: I’m not sure that the candidates themselves do a lot of good by litigating more complex points about electability with the public. Their campaigns might do it on background with journalists, but it’s probably best left there.
ameliatd: I agree with that, Nate. One recent study did show that people were more likely to rate female candidates as electable when they were first reminded about how many women won in 2018 — but I don’t think having the candidates make that pitch will necessarily work.
sarahf: But if the best way for a candidate to run is on their ability to beat Trump, how can their stances on other issues help them accomplish that? Or make them seem more electable?
Let’s start with an issue that a lot of voters also care about (it was the second most popular pick for top issue in our Ipsos poll) — health care.
Should Democrats talk about health care more?
Less?
nrakich: Exit polls showed that health care was the most important issue to voters in the 2018 midterm elections, which obviously worked out well for Democrats. So I think that’s good ground for the candidates to focus on for the general election.
For the primary, maybe less so — it depends on their position on health care!
natesilver: I remain convinced that health care is the best issue that Sanders has going for him.
Although, according to our poll, Biden actually gained ground with voters who prioritized the issue. Warren and Harris have been somewhat stuck in the middle on health care, though, and I think it’s a real problem for them.
nrakich: But Nate, what about those polls that show that a single-payer health care system is less popular, even among Democrats, than building on Obamacare (with, say, a public option)?
natesilver: At least Sanders has leadership on the issue. True, Biden has the most popular position. But Harris and Warren got nothing.

Poll was conducted from Sept. 5 to Sept. 11 among a general population sample of adults, with 4,320 respondents who say they are likely to vote in their state’s Democratic primary or caucus
Yeah, going into the debate, Sanders had the lead among voters in our poll who prioritized health care. (But Sanders wasn’t the only candidate to gain potential supporters among voters who prioritized health care after the debate — Biden, Yang, Warren and Buttigieg all made bigger gains.)
ameliatd: Part of the challenge, too, is that people still don’t understand the details of all of these plans — for example, Medicare for All, as Sanders and Warren talk about it, involves getting rid of private insurance. That could be more and more of an issue for the candidates on the left. Warren and Sanders keep saying people don’t like their insurance — but that’s not really true.
The health care debate is hard because people want something better, but they’re also afraid of losing what they have.
sarahf: Yeah, the branding of “Medicare for All who want it” that Buttigeig and others are pushing is pretty ingenious, even if it’s just as difficult or costly to pull off as the version of Medicare for All that Sanders and Warren are pitching.
ameliatd: It is weirdly off-brand for Warren to not have a detailed plan on health care. But maybe she’s trying not to get beaten up in the fight over Medicare for All.
natesilver: It’s very off-brand. And, sure, there might be tactical reasons for it. All of which goes to my theory that Warren is more of a politician than she’s assumed to be, which you’d think is a pretty normal thing to say about someone who’s a professional politician but will probably come across as something of a hot take.
I dunno, sometimes Warren’s strategy seems predicated on the idea that she doesn’t need to throw a lot of elbows or make a lot of tight pivots to beat Sanders.
sarahf: Well, if part of the primary is to pitch voters on big ideas, it makes sense to me that Warren isn’t curtailing her vision for Medicare for All just yet.
ameliatd: I wonder also if she thinks there’s too much competition on health care. It can be pretty difficult to follow which candidate is proposing what and what the actual differences are. It’s simpler to just say she’s with Sanders.
nrakich: I do find it interesting that Warren is doing so well in the polls despite not really emphasizing the top two priorities that Democratic voters cited in our poll (electability and health care).
sarahf: In its analysis of swing voters in 2020, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in addition to having a big advantage on health care, Democrats have a whopping advantage (38 percentage points) on climate change.
So … should the candidates be talking about climate change more?
(According to an analysis by Bloomberg, only 6 percent of the third debate was devoted to it.)
nrakich: I think you have to draw a line between the primary and general election for a lot of these.
As you alluded to with that poll, Sarah, I think the eventual Democratic nominee could have success by talking a lot about climate change next year.
But the differences between the primary candidates on climate change are pretty in the weeds, so I’m not sure whom it would help to talk about it more.
I also think the failure of Jay Inslee’s campaign to win on climate change showed that the issue just wasn’t a big differentiator either (although IMO he had other problems too, like not being very inspiring on the stump).
sarahf: That’s interesting, Nathaniel. So unlike health care, where there’s an incentive for the candidates to hash out their differences, maybe something like climate change should be saved for the general?
nrakich: Yeah, I think there are pretty major differences between the candidates on health care. And having a nominee run on single-payer vs. a public option could be important to swing voters in the general. But I don’t think Republicans will attack a nominee any harder if he or she is trying to get the U.S. to net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 instead of 2050.
ameliatd: Well, another difference between health care and climate is that they’re both fairly technical, complicated issues, but one has a direct and personal impact on people’s health and bank accounts, while the other is more diffuse. It’s harder to get concrete on climate change, too. Which is sometimes why you end up with candidates talking about banning plastic straws.
natesilver: Also on climate — the political willpower to get things done when Joe Manchin is the median vote in the Senate is far less than any of the Democrats’ plans would like.
In some ways, I’m surprised Democrats haven’t spent more time talking about structural issues, like gerrymandering, adding new states (Puerto Rico, D.C.) and things of that nature.
sarahf: I mean, they did wade into blowing up the filibuster in the last debate.
Do you really think that’s good politics for the candidates, though?
natesilver: Oh yeah, sure. I think it’s a good way for Warren to differentiate herself from Sanders, for instance.
ameliatd: Blowing up the filibuster seems like it’s become a way for candidates to say they’re serious about passing their agenda. So it’s kind of a proxy for how far the candidates are willing to go, and how much they care about compromise.
nrakich: I think it has the potential to be good politics, Sarah. People don’t like it when they perceive the system to be unfair, and Democrats can pretty easily make the argument that the system is currently biased against urban dwellers, people of color and others.
Gerrymandering is a good example of something that few people defend. But no Democrat is out there shouting about it from the rooftops.
Voting rights also don’t register very high on the priority list when voters are asked what issues they care about, but there is a lot of political science research that says that politicians can influence what voters care about. And I bet the issue would become more salient if a top-tier candidate talked about it more.
ameliatd: I have also wondered why the Supreme Court hasn’t been a bigger issue so far — it is more unpopular with Democrats than it has been in 20 years, and progressive activists are advocating for some pretty big court reforms, like increasing the number of justices on the bench. And if you’re talking about roadblocks for your progressive agenda — a Supreme Court with a conservative majority is certainly at the top of that list.
nrakich: Maybe it hasn’t been very salient in the primary because it’s assumed that every possible nominee would appoint pro-choice, pro-voting-rights, generally liberal justices?
ameliatd: But there are differences between the candidates on how to approach the Supreme Court — big ones! At least seven candidates still in the race are open to the idea of adding justices to the court, according to The Washington Post. And some have talked about changing its structure in other ways (adding term limits, for example) which would also be quite dramatic.
nrakich: Good point. Maybe Democrats aren’t bringing it up, then, because the issue risks activating Republican voters in the general election?
ameliatd: It is definitely true that the courts historically have been a motivating issue for Republican voters and not really for Democrats. But I think there’s potential for the Democrats to make the Supreme Court into an issue that their voters care about.
natesilver: And I think after Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination last year, there’s still an open question about whether which party gets most motivated by the Supreme Court has shifted. In a Gallup poll just before the midterms, roughly as many Democrats as Republicans called Kavanaugh an important issue in deciding their vote.
That said, I don’t think calling for Kavanaugh’s impeachment is a very wise general election position.
ameliatd: No, I agree — a focus on impeaching Kavanaugh seems tailor-made to rile up Republicans. Part of the issue is that there just isn’t a clear message among Democrats about the Supreme Court or the judiciary in general. Some people want term limits. Others want court-packing, or they want more talk about the type of judicial nominees the candidates would nominate.
sarahf: But what about an issue where Democrats don’t have an advantage (like the economy) and are in a weaker position among voters than Trump? In that same poll on swing voters, KFF gave Trump a 12-point advantage for his handling of economy. And in our Ipsos poll, we found that economy-focused Democrats gave candidates worse marks across the board than voters focused on four other top issues, suggesting that economy voters were maybe unsatisfied by what they heard in the debate.
nrakich: Yeah, Democrats could stand to talk more in the primary about the economy in the traditional sense, like jobs.
For the general election, though, that does seem to be a good issue for Republicans (for now).
natesilver: Isn’t the obvious way for Democrats to talk about the economy to talk about inequality and how the economy ain’t workin’ for some people?
Unless the economy actually goes way south, in which case you have a lot more things you can say.
nrakich: Yes, but we did offer “wealth and income inequality” as an issue in our poll, and those voters seemed to have different perspectives than the “economy” voters.
If we’re talking about the primary, Warren and Sanders have gotten pretty far by talking about inequality, but our poll does suggest there’s a subset of voters for whom that isn’t what they want to hear about the economy.
sarahf: And while trying to motivate voters around economic inequality sounds good in theory, in practice, I don’t think it actually moves the dial much. Although, there is evidence that voters are keen on a tax on the uber-wealthy, so maybe that’s a good tack for Democrats to take in talking about the economy more?
ameliatd: Right, talking about making the wealthy pay their fair share seems like a smart way for Democrats to approach this.
But what do you think voters want to be hearing on the economy front, Nathaniel? In our poll, “jobs” was listed as a separate option and not that many people seemed interested in hearing about that.
nrakich: Yeah, Amelia, I’m not quite sure. Given their candidate preferences (i.e., voters who prioritized the economy also liked Biden and were much less likely to be considering a vote for Warren or Sanders), maybe those are the fiscally minded voters who oppose Warren and Sanders’s efforts to redistribute wealth.
In other words, business-friendly Democrats?
natesilver: Yeah, Democrats need to be careful on this issue.
Socialism is still not a popular concept with swing voters. Maybe it will be once the millennials and zoomers take over. But for now, it’s a big general-election vulnerability for Sanders, for instance.
nrakich: Wait, this is the first time I’ve heard zoomers as a nickname for Generation Z and I love it.
natesilver: “Let’s get the economy workin’ for workin’ people and make the rich pay their fair share” is probably fine for a general election message. “Let’s topple the entire system” maybe isn’t.
sarahf: But as Nathaniel said earlier … this is the primary. And isn’t socialism more popular than capitalism among Democrats?
So, similar to some of the candidates being more radical on health care, isn’t there an argument to be made they should dream bigger on the economy, too?
natesilver: Well, yeah, but part of what smart candidates do is avoid driving wedges on issues where it might give you a slight advantage in the primary but a big disadvantage in the general election.
nrakich: And while it’s true, Sarah, that Democrats think more highly of socialism than of capitalism, their views of capitalism are still mostly favorable, according to the Pew Research Center. We’re also forgetting that 40 percent of Democrats think the most important thing is to beat Trump! I can imagine plenty of pro-socialism Democrats being persuaded to tone down the rhetoric (but maybe not the policies — Warren is basically doing this) in order to avoid being general-election poison.
ameliatd: Also, isn’t Warren’s wealth tax, which would be applied to rich people’s accumulated fortunes rather than just their income, be an example of Democrats dreaming big? She seems to be doing a good job of selling it as “just making the rich pay their fair share,” but it’s still a pretty radical change from the status quo.
sarahf: That’s fair, Amelia.
And to wrap, if candidates could run on only one issue — and it isn’t beating Trump, because let’s treat that as the overarching argument of everyone’s campaign — what would it be?
nrakich: I think it’s got to be health care, especially if you’re not a single-payer Democrat. Follow the playbook that worked in 2018.
natesilver: It depends on the candidate. For Biden, it’s electability. For Sanders, it’s health care. For Warren, it’s … I’m not sure, exactly? But I think probably inequality.
nrakich: Breakin’ Sarah’s rules (“and it isn’t beating Trump”), Nate …
Intriguing side question: Is it a problem for Biden if he runs on an electability argument during the primary and then doesn’t have a clear rationale for running come the general?
sarahf: What other issue does Biden have to lean into? Health care, maybe?
natesilver: Maybe Biden could adopt a signature issue — or two.
I’m not sure what it would be, though. Guns, maybe?
ameliatd: We didn’t talk about gun policy, but I’ll be interested to see if that has sticking power as the primary moves forward. That’s a big priority for voters right now, but maybe it’s also an issue like climate change where the candidates struggle to differentiate themselves.
Also, I am shamelessly dodging the question, but personal characteristics are also important to voters. A Pew survey from last month asked Democrats to name the most important factor for deciding which candidate to support, and 28 percent named something like honesty or competence. About the same share pointed to a policy. So … maybe policy just matters less than we assume?
nrakich: Great point, Amelia. We basically just did a whole chat on issues while ignoring the fact that people mostly don’t vote on issues!
ameliatd: Shut it down, guys.
natesilver: But you can still vote on the aesthetics of a candidate’s policy positions even if you don’t care about policy per se.
Like, people can like the idea that Warren has a plan for things, even if they don’t know what those plans are, exactly.
nrakich: Right, but to the original chat prompt, does it matter, then, what issues are and aren’t being discussed?
As you pointed out, Warren doesn’t have a meaty health care plan but still gets credit for being issue-driven.
ameliatd: I wonder if Warren’s focus on an overarching theme like corruption can also help with the perception that she’s honest, or something like that.
But then it does make you wonder how much the details matter, as opposed to how the issues fit into a candidate’s overall brand.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Copyright © 2019 by Randall Munroe. All rights reserved. No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher.


Winning elections is hard. The truth is, people are complicated, there are a lot of them, and no one is ever 100 percent sure why they do what they do or what they’re going to do next.
But if your goal is simply to win an election, then as a general rule you should be for things that voters like and against things they dislike. To do that, you’ll need to figure out what the voters like and dislike. One of the most popular tools for figuring out what the public thinks is opinion polling — talking to a bunch of people, asking them what they think and tallying up the results. The website FiveThirtyEight has conducted an exercise in which they had professional speechwriters write a speech that simply pandered as much as possible — only making statements that most voters support, to pander either to one party or to the electorate in general.
But what do we agree on the most? If your goal is simply to be in favor of popular things and against unpopular things, what should you campaign on? What are the least controversial issues in the country?
To help figure this out, I reached out to Kathleen Weldon, director of data operations and communications at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University, to commission a poll of their polls. The Roper Center maintains a tremendous database of opinion polling data — over 700,000 polling questions spanning almost a century of opinion polling, collected from virtually every organization that has ever conducted a public poll in the United States.
I told them I was looking for the most one-sided questions in their polling database — the questions where virtually everyone gave the same answer. In a sense, these would be the least divisive issues in the country.
The Roper research staff sifted through their database of 700,000 questions and assembled a list of those questions for which at least 95 percent of respondents gave the same answer.
It’s pretty rare for that many respondents to agree on anything in a poll. A small percentage of respondents will often choose ridiculous answers because they’re not taking the poll seriously or because they misunderstand the question. But one-sided questions are also rare because no one bothers to conduct polls on uncontroversial topics unless they’re trying to prove a point. Since everything in the Roper database is something that some person or organization bothered to commission a poll to ask, it means it’s at least potentially controversial, if not actually so.
Here is a selection of the most one-sided issues in the history of polling. If you want to run for office, these are views you can safely espouse, secure in the knowledge that at least one scientific survey puts the people squarely behind you:
95 percent disapprove of people using cell phones in movie theaters. (Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel Poll, 2014)
97 percent believe there should be laws against texting while driving. (The New York Times/CBS News Poll, 2009)
96 percent have a positive impression of small business. (Gallup Poll, 2016)
95 percent believe employers should not be able to access the DNA of their employees without permission. (Time/CNN/Yankelovich Partners Poll, 1998)
95 percent support laws against money laundering involving terrorism. (Washington Post Poll, 2001)
95 percent think doctors should be licensed. (Private Initiatives & Public Values, 1981)
95 percent would support going to war if the United States were invaded. (Harris Survey, 1971)
96 percent oppose legalizing crystal meth. (CNN/ORC International Poll, 2014)
95 percent are satisfied with their friends. (Associated Press/Media General Poll, 1984)
95 percent say that “if a pill were available that made you twice as good looking as you are now, but only half as smart,” they would not take it. (Men’s Health Work Survey, 2000)
98 percent believe adults should watch swimmers rather than reading or talking on the phone. (American Red Cross Water Safety Poll, 2013)
99 percent think it’s wrong for employees to steal expensive equipment from their workplace. (NBC News Poll, 1995)
95 percent think it’s wrong to pay someone to do a term paper for you. (NBC News Poll, 1995)
98 percent would like to see a decline in hunger in the world. (Harris Survey, 1983)
97 percent would like to see a decline in terrorism and violence. (Harris Survey, 1983)
98% would like to see an end to high unemployment. (Harris Survey, 1982)
95 percent would like to see an end to all wars. (Harris Survey, 1981)
95 percent would like to see a decline in prejudice. (Harris Survey, 1977)
95 percent don’t believe Magic 8 Balls can predict the future. (Shell Poll, 1998)
96 percent think the Olympics are a great sports competition. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution Poll, 1996)
You can use this list to assemble a campaign platform. For example, you could stand firmly against hunger, war and terrorism; for friendship and small business; and against texting while driving. You could support laws that ensure doctors are properly licensed and oppose allowing other countries to invade.
On the other hand, if you wanted to lose an election as spectacularly as possible, this list could be even more helpful as a blueprint. By taking the opposing position on each issue, you could potentially run the most unpopular political campaign in political history. You’d probably lose, but who knows!",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

They have few household names on their roster, and they’re the No. 2 team in a West Coast market in a stadium that they’re trying to leave as soon as possible. Even as the A’s have climbed to rank as the fourth-best team in the majors by FiveThirtyEight’s Elo ratings, in recent weeks the club might be most known for the G-shaped beard of Mike Fiers that captured the public’s attention. But Oakland should be able to keep baseball’s attention now, as it is again on the cusp of securing an American League wild-card spot, one of the few unsettled postseason races in the majors. Despite owning just the sport’s 25th-ranked payroll, Oakland has a 96 percent chance of making the playoffs.
Prior to last season, we saw the A’s as a 76-win team, FanGraphs had the A’s at 78 wins, and Vegas placed the over-under at 74.5 wins. The A’s would win 97 games. This spring, we pegged the A’s as an 83-win team, FanGraphs made an 85-win call, and Las Vegas placed the club’s over-under win total at 83.5. The A’s are on track for another 97-win season. How are they again exceeding expectations? It’s a formula similar to last year’s — with a few different players leading the charge and a new unconventional strategy.
The A’s have already changed baseball once: In the early 2000s, they helped accelerate the embrace of analytics in baseball by exploiting market inefficiencies. And now, they’re arguably at the forefront of major shifts in the sport once again. Last season, they got ahead of other teams in keeping balls off the ground on offense and leaned on a strong bullpen that combined for the second-most innings in the majors. This year, the A’s again have a strong bullpen and an offensive lineup with one of the lowest ground-ball rates in baseball.
The A’s position players are again excellent, ranking fifth in the majors in wins above replacement1 and offensive efficiency (107 weighted runs created plus)2 entering Wednesday. The team has already set a franchise record for home runs in a season, but they’re also fourth in baseball in defensive efficiency, which is the share of balls put in play by opponents that are turned into outs.
After five A’s players posted at least 3 WAR last year, they’ve already matched that this season. The A’s have five of the 66 players who have produced at least 3 WAR this year; only the division rival Astros have more, with six.
Sluggers Matt Chapman and Matt Olson have been standouts for multiple years, but the best player on the A’s this season has been shortstop Marcus Semien, who has broken out for 6.8 WAR. He ranks seventh among the most improved players by WAR this season. He’s reduced his strikeouts while adding power, and he’s also gone from being a below-average defender earlier in his career to an above-average one, according to advanced metrics like ultimate zone rating. Outfielder Mark Canha is another unlikely star — acquired by the A’s with a Rule V draft selection — who has become a middle-of-the-order slugger, and outfielder Ramón Laureano is yet another improved hitter who also boasts a tremendous throwing arm.3
The A’s pitchers are also zigging in another area where clubs have zagged. Teams are favoring four-seam fastballs up in the zone, and the league, as a whole, has moved away from throwing sinkers. But the A’s lead baseball in sinker usage, which has perhaps helped them sport the lowest home run-to-fly ball ratio in the majors, as well as the fourth-best differential in home runs hit versus allowed (55), through Sunday.4
And while the A’s have dominated this season without a rotation ace, they did recently welcome back Sean Manaea, perhaps their most talented arm, who has been excellent in his return from shoulder surgery. Maybe Manaea and the rest of the relative unknowns can keep up momentum going into where A’s haven’t exceeded expectations: the playoffs.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/eli-manning-was-an-all-time-average-qb/,2019-09-18,,,features,"Sep. 18, 2019",Eli Manning Was An All-Time Average QB,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"The end of Eli Manning’s stint as starting quarterback for the New York Giants appears to be at hand. The team announced Tuesday that it was moving on from its longtime fixture under center, naming rookie Daniel Jones as starter going forward. With that, one of the greatest — and weirdest — runs that any iconic franchise leader ever had is coming to an end.
As we’ve detailed before, the youngest Manning brother has been a very average quarterback over the course of his NFL career. In fact, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com’s advanced passing index, he is one of the most average QBs ever, checking in with a lifetime adjusted net yards per attempt (ANY/A) index of 101 (where 100 is dead-average for the era). Manning’s durability has managed to keep him in the lineup longer than most other passers — more on that later — but on a rate basis, there hasn’t been much special about Manning’s career passing efficiency numbers.
The way Eli got to average, however, was anything but. Among qualified QBs since the merger, Manning is the only one to grade out as average or better by ANY/A while simultaneously rating below average in completion percentage, yards per attempt and interception percentage. He pulled off that feat by being better than average at throwing for touchdowns — and he’s had plenty of memorable TD strikes over the years — while ranking as one of the best in history at avoiding sacks (something else that shows up in his signature moments). Unlike his brother Peyton, who became an all-time legend by excelling in basically the same categories as other great QBs did, Eli did it his own way, as always.
And then there are the epic highs and ignoble lows of Manning’s tenure in New York. Although his yearly efficiency marks have — somewhat surprisingly — not bounced around too much more than those of his peers, Manning has compounded his regular-season performances with playoff numbers that have been all over the place. When he was leading the Giants to a pair of Super Bowl victories after the 2007 and 2011 seasons, Manning went a perfect (by definition) 8-0 with a passer rating (100.1) nearly 7 points higher than he ever had in any single regular season of his career. In all of his other postseason appearances combined, he went 0-4 with a rating (61.8) about 8 points worse than any regular season he’d had after his rookie campaign.

For such an average quarterback, Manning became a much more extreme version of himself in the playoffs — which worked wonders twice and failed badly on four other occasions. Now, you might expect most Super Bowl-winning QBs to have such a split; after all, the team is also much more likely to win when its starting QB plays better. But even relative to other multi-time Super Bowl winners, Manning stands out. None of them were worse by quarterback rating in their non-Super Bowl winning playoff runs, and only Troy Aikman had a bigger split in QB ratings between years when he won the Super Bowl and years when he didn’t.

There’s also Manning’s penchant for staying in the lineup week in and week out. Manning is tied for 23rd in NFL history in games started (at any position) and had the second-longest consecutive QB starts streak ever going until 2017, when former N.Y. coach Ben McAdoo bungled literally everything about the Giants’ season. Manning is — once again — so different from his peers on the quarterback durability list.
For all his success, Eli is exceptionally average

He’s 12th in all-time QB wins, just ahead of four-time Super Bowl winner Terry Bradshaw, and right behind four-time winner Joe Montana. Among the top 10 in wins, every QB had a career passing index1 of at least 106; all but two (Brett Favre and John Elway) have an index of at least 110. Bradshaw and Montana also crack 106. But then there’s Eli, at 98, the winningest truly average QB in pro football history. (Or the most average winning QB ever, depending on how you look at it.) Manning might stand out as mediocre among that group of legends — but you still have to give him credit for being in the group in the first place.
Add it all up, and Eli — the super-average QB, the mega-durable starter, the multi-time champion — has had one of the most interesting career arcs of any quarterback ever, if not any athlete, period. I went looking for other players in the NBA or MLB2 who ranked among the top 50 in all-time career value (Manning was 36th in lifetime Approximate Value going into 2019) who also were basically average on a rate basis and won multiple championships:
Among the Top 50 in NBA Win Shares, Elvin Hayes was closest to average on a per-minute basis, and he also led the 1978 champion Washington Bullets in WS, though that was the only title he won.
In baseball, Pete Rose is probably the most average hitter to crack the Top 50 in Baseball-Reference.com’s wins above replacement, and he won three World Series (including being named MVP in 1975). Rose, however, had a career OPS+ of 118, so he was better at hitting than Manning has been at efficient passing.
Among pitchers, Tommy John was the most average in the WAR Top 50, but he never won a title. Going down the list, the closest Eli analogue might be Don Drysdale, who won three World Series with the Dodgers from 1959 to 1965. Like Rose, though, Drysdale might have been too good: His career ERA+ was 121, which was also a fair amount better relative to average than Manning has been at QB.
The difficulty in finding exact comparables for Manning from other sports underscores how singular his career has been in its ups, downs and, in the end, its average-ness. I shouldn’t talk about Eli’s career in the past tense, of course. He’s 38 years old, but this is an era when top QBs play well into their forties. There even remains some chance that Jones falters (or is injured) and Manning is reinstalled as starter by season’s end — though once teams hand the keys to a young starter, they don’t tend to reverse course on that decision.
Ironically, after years of Manning being worse than the perception of him, his numbers last season weren’t as terrible as they might have seemed. His ANY/A index of 101 matched his career average exactly. But this year, that number has dropped to 93. Though he is still 23rd in our starting QB rankings, ahead of such QBs as Derek Carr and Andy Dalton, his 62.3 quarterback rating in Sunday’s loss to Buffalo was apparently too much for New York coach Pat Shurmur to bear.
Once beloved by fans at the Meadowlands, Manning has largely seen Giant backers turn on him, or at least pity him, even if they’ll always appreciate the pair of Super Bowls he helped bring to the franchise. Such is the nature of the what-have-you-done-for-me-lately NFL. But while it lasted, there was no denying that Manning’s run with the Giants was one of the strangest, most impressive (and simultaneously unimpressive) careers we’ve seen in sports.
Looking Ahead: Week 3
Best matchup: No. 3 L.A. Rams (-3) at No. 18 Cleveland, 8:20 p.m. ET Sunday
Matchup quality: 83rd percentile3
Matchup evenness: 61st percentile
For the second week in a row, the Rams are involved in our top matchup of the week. Last Sunday, their big showdown with the Saints was obscured by an injury to New Orleans QB Drew Brees before L.A. cruised to a 27-9 victory. This time, they’ll face the Browns in Cleveland on Sunday Night Football. Rams quarterback Jared Goff improved his QB Elo rating with a solid game against the Saints, though he still checks in at No. 19 in our rankings. As for Cleveland, it rebounded from a disappointing opening-week thrashing by the Titans at home to beat the hapless Jets on Monday night. QB Baker Mayfield has started the season slow, and our ratings slot him lower in the NFL pecking order than Goff. But Cleveland’s Elo is still the highest it’s been since October 2008.

Biggest playoff implications: No. 15 Houston at No. 6 L.A. Chargers (-4.5), 4:25 p.m. ET Sunday
Potential shift in playoff odds: 25.1 total percentage points
Week 3 games between 1-1 teams can have a surprisingly large effect on each club’s eventual fate. The best example this season is Sunday’s tilt between the Chargers and Texans, which will solidify the winner’s playoff position but leave the loser with far less than a coin flip’s chance at the postseason. A Houston win would create especially large swings, with the Texans’ playoff odds improving by 18 percentage points (from 42 percent to 60 percent) and the Chargers’ chances dropping by a whopping 19 points (from 59 percent to 40 percent). By comparison, a Chargers win would improve L.A.’s playoff odds by 10 percentage points and reduce Houston’s by 9 points. Texans QB Deshaun Watson is looking to bounce back from a subpar effort last week against Jacksonville, but our model gives Philip Rivers and the Chargers a 66 percent chance of winning at home.

Home teams are in bold.
The scoring system is nonlinear, so readers’ average points don’t necessarily match the number of points that would be given to the average reader prediction.
Even with Sam Darnold sidelined, Elo thought Monday night’s Jets-Browns contest was a pick-’em. Whoops! That was the model’s biggest whiff of Week 2, and it cost Elo 7.0 points as compared with the average FiveThirtyEight reader. There were also a few other games where Elo was too confident in the eventual loser (Tennessee against Indy, Pittsburgh against Seattle) or not confident enough in the eventual winner (Dallas vs. Washington, Chicago vs. Denver). But the algorithm gained back some points by hedging on the Lions’ chances against the Chargers and a few confident picks such as Green Bay over Minnesota and the Rams over the Saints. All told, Elo beat the average FiveThirtyEight picker by 13.6 points in Week 2, bringing its season tally to a pair of wins and no losses.
Among individual readers, congrats to Spencer Coster, who led all (identified) readers in Week 2 with 170.4 points, and to Nolan Lissman, whose 326.8 points leads the seasonlong contest. Thanks to everyone who played — and if you haven’t, be sure to get in on the action! You can make picks now and try your luck against Elo, even if you missed Week 2.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/highly-touted-qbs-dont-usually-flunk-out-of-the-nfl-right-away/,2019-09-17,,,features,"Sep. 17, 2019",Top QB Draft Picks Don’t Usually Flunk Out Of The NFL Right Away,Ari Levin,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"Kyler Murray had a rough start to his NFL career. Facing the Detroit Lions in Week 1, the No. 1 overall draft pick of the Arizona Cardinals threw an ugly interception in the first quarter, was sacked by his own lineman and entered the fourth quarter with a stat line of 9-26 for 70 yards.
But the rookie did not give up when faced with adversity. Down 24-6, Arizona’s hope for the future hit a groove. He led a field-goal drive and then threw two touchdowns to bring the game to overtime. After Murray produced another field-goal drive in the extra period, the Lions marched back to tie the game, but he led a long enough drive to secure a tie for his team. Considering the circumstances, it was not a bad debut for the former Heisman winner.
These days, it seems like every rookie quarterback drafted in the first round enters the NFL ready to play immediately, even if they sit out for a while, as Patrick Mahomes did. But the one thing you can almost guarantee is that once they get the starting job, barring injury, they won’t give it up for a while — at least for the first two years.
The 2019 rookie quarterback status — with the top pick starting out of the gates and a couple others waiting for their chance1 — is fairly typical based on recent history. Since the 2010 draft, 40 percent of first-round quarterbacks (12 of 30) have started Week 1. That’s an increase from 23 percent (six of 26) the previous decade.
But it’s the 2018 quarterback class — the famed five-member first round — that shows a different story. Even though No. 3 pick Sam Darnold was the only Week 1 starter, all five started at least seven games during their rookie seasons, played in at least 122 and started each of the last four weeks. Four of those five were the clear-cut 2019 starters for their respective teams.3 The other was Josh Rosen.
Rosen struggled in 14 games as a rookie on a Cardinals team with a rookie head coach, an offensive line ravaged by injuries and a poor defense. He was ultimately shipped to Miami this offseason, where he has thus far failed to win the starting job and looked overmatched in his brief game action.

It’s rare for a team these days to move on from a young quarterback so quickly. Of the 22 first-round quarterbacks drafted between 2010 and 2017, only six didn’t start Week 1 of their third year in the league. Two (Carson Wentz and Teddy Bridgewater) would have started if not for injuries. The other four all were picked lower than Rosen, all are currently out of the NFL, and all are now seen as busts.
Brandon Weeden, pick No. 22 in 2012 for the Cleveland Browns, started the first 15 games as a rookie and went 5-10 (which is pretty good by Browns standards). He was replaced by Thad Lewis for the final game after a shoulder injury. In 2013, he began as the Browns’ starter but hurt his thumb in Week 2 by hitting an offensive lineman’s helmet. He was replaced by Brian Hoyer, but an injury to Hoyer in Week 4 put Weeden back as the starter for three more weeks until he was benched for Jason Campbell. He had one more start after Campbell suffered a concussion, but Campbell finished the season. Weeden was cut that offseason at the age of 30, right before the Browns drafted another first-round quarterback…
Johnny Manziel, pick No. 22 in 2014 for the Browns, wasn’t expected to start right away. Behind a surprisingly effective Hoyer, the Browns at one point even led the division. Then, Hoyer went through a three-game stretch of no touchdowns and seven interceptions, and it was Johnny Football’s time to shine. A hamstring injury forced Manziel out of his second start, and rumors spread about his work ethic and lack of professionalism. Manziel started one game early in 2015 but was soon behind Josh McCown, until McCown’s injury gave him another chance in Week 9. After starting the next week, he lost his job after posts surfaced of him partying in Texas, but he got one last chance in Weeks 15 and 16 after McCown was injured a third time and Austin Davis was benched. Manziel famously struggled both on and off the field, and he was out of the league by 2016.
EJ Manuel, pick No. 16 in 2013 for the Buffalo Bills, started on opening day and for five straight weeks before a knee injury, and then he started five more before another knee injury cost him the final two games. He managed to keep his job for 2014, but after a poor performance in Week 4, he was benched for Kyle Orton, who finished the season. In 2015, Manuel lost the starting role to Tyrod Taylor in training camp, though he did make two starts that year when Taylor battled injuries.
Paxton Lynch, pick No. 26 in 2016 for the Denver Broncos, lost the starting job in training camp to second-year starter Trevor Siemian.4 The 6-foot-7 Lynch played in Week 4 and started games 5 and 12 — but only in place of an injured Siemian. The next season, Lynch suffered a shoulder injury in the preseason and again found himself behind Siemian and now Brock Osweiler. He made his third career start in Week 12 after the others flopped, but that went poorly and ended with an injury. He was back once more for the regular-season finale, throwing two touchdowns and two interceptions. The Broncos released Lynch before the 2018 season after he failed to beat out any of Case Keenum, Chad Kelly and Kevin Hogan for a roster spot.
Basically, something has to go very wrong for a quarterback drafted in the first round not to get an extended stint across years as a starting quarterback in the modern NFL, and Rosen is in line to join their company. Rosen has already lost his job once, but he’s slated for another chance; current Miami starter Ryan Fitzpatrick has played every game in a season only three times in his 15-year career.
If Rosen doesn’t get that chance this year, it would be unusual — and would put him alongside names that some fans would rather forget. The question is whether Rosen will ever get a fair chance to prove himself, especially considering the lack of talent around him in Miami. But perhaps Rosen, like Weeden and those before him, had to fail so others could succeed.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/charles-leclerc-has-gone-from-ferraris-future-to-its-present/,2019-09-17,,,features,"Sep. 13, 2019",Formula One Has A New Top Contender,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,Formula One,"In recent years, Formula One’s defining rivalry has seemed clear: Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes (and before that, McLaren) vs. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari (and before that, Red Bull). The two have combined to win nine of the past 11 world driver’s championships, with the only interlopers being Jenson Button in 2009 and Nico Rosberg, another of Hamilton’s most bitter rivals, in 2016. Hamilton and Vettel finished 1-2 in each of the previous two seasons’ standings, so the path to the F1 title seemed very likely to go through them in 2019 as well.
This year, though, only one of the two has held up his end of the bargain. Hamilton currently leads the championship, 63 points clear of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas. But instead of vying for the title as well, Vettel is all the way back in fifth place, 115 points behind his English archrival. The German hasn’t finished so low in the standings since 2014, his tumultuous final season with Red Bull.
With the recent breakout of Vettel’s Ferrari teammate, Charles Leclerc — the 21-year-old rising star who just grabbed his first two F1 career wins in back-to-back races — there are legitimate questions as to which driver Hamilton should be more concerned about as a rival going forward. In fact, Leclerc has done so well in his second F1 season that the four-time world champ Vettel might not even be the No. 1 driver on his own team anymore.
That this is up for debate speaks volumes about Leclerc’s meteoric ascent. The Monégasque phenom was a teenager in Formula Two just a couple of years ago, impressing as a test driver but failing to nail down a seat at a prestige team for his rookie F1 season. Leclerc joined Alfa Romeo-Sauber for 2018 instead and flashed his potential with a very strong qualifying performance against teammate Marcus Ericsson, whom he started ahead of on the grid 17 times in 21 races (81 percent) last season. But on race days, Leclerc finished slightly worse than he started,1 beat Ericsson only 57 percent of the time (after adjusting for grid position)2 and notched only 39 points in the championship, finishing a distant 13th.
(Besides, Ericsson wasn’t exactly the toughest competition; he didn’t secure an F1 ride in 2019 and currently competes in the IndyCar series.)
Still, Ferrari saw the talent evident in Leclerc’s performance and pegged him to replace folk hero Kimi Räikkönen as Vettel’s No. 2 going into 2019. But Vettel’s place atop the pecking order seemed secure. He had spent most of the previous four seasons driving circles around Räikkönen, beating the 2007 world champion in 67 percent of qualifying runs and 73 percent of races. Although he couldn’t quite outduel Hamilton, finishing an average of 101 points behind him in the overall standings during those seasons, Vettel was still very competitive — and hopeful that a new 2019 design package would bring the Prancing Horse its first championship (as either a constructor or for its drivers) since the late 2000s.
The early returns seemed like business as usual. Although Mercedes opened the season with an eight-race winning streak, as Hamilton took six of those checkered flags himself, Vettel had also outdriven Leclerc 12 times in 14 chances (including both qualifying and races) over the first seven events on the schedule. (The only exception was the Bahrain Grand Prix, where Leclerc won the pole and finished third to Vettel’s fifth.) Vettel even technically crossed the finish line first in Canada, only to see Hamilton be awarded the win because of a controversial penalty assessed when Vettel swerved back onto the track after a missed turn.
Ever since that moment, however, Leclerc has surged past his older, more decorated teammate at a breathtaking pace. If we build an Elo rating using the same head-to-head approach that I used in this story about Fernando Alonso from last summer — which just compared teammate performances with each other (to control for differences in constructor quality) and gave qualifiers half-weight as compared with races — Leclerc moved past Vettel for the very first time in his career when he won the Italian Grand Prix last Sunday:
This teammate-versus-teammate approach isn’t perfect, particularly when it involves drivers who haven’t changed teams much. But it is able to infer one driver’s performance from how often he beats another driver of an established ability level. And Vettel is certainly established; he went into the season (and his partnership with Leclerc) with the third-best rating of any driver in the 2019 field, trailing only Hamilton and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen — another Leclerc-esque wunderkind (also 21 years old) trying to end the Hamilton-Vettel hegemony atop the F1 standings.
For Leclerc’s part, he has risen from a relatively mediocre head-to-head Elo of 1454 after the Canadian Grand Prix on June 9 to a 1529 mark (fourth-best in the field) after back-to-back victories in Belgium and Italy these past two weeks. He has now outperformed Vettel in each of the past seven qualifying sessions and five of the past seven races (the only exceptions being Germany and Hungary). By coolly fending off the best attacks Hamilton and Bottas could throw at him, the “unflappable” Leclerc gave Ferrari a win at Monza — its home race — for the first time since Alonso did it in 2010. Along the way, he has given Vettel more fits than just about any teammate in his entire career:

Despite the back-to-back losses, Mercedes isn’t exactly worried about Leclerc chasing Hamilton down for the title. The quick circuits of the past two races probably favored Ferrari, with the superior straight-line speed of its SF90 car. And even after Leclerc’s big breakthrough, he remains 102 points behind Hamilton (and 39 behind Bottas) in the standings, with Ferrari running 154 behind Mercedes in the team tally as they look ahead to the season’s final seven races.
But although Leclerc’s wins didn’t make much impact on the overall championship picture, they may have represented something of a turning point in F1 history. Going into 2019, Vettel had outqualified his teammates — a strong group that included Räikkönen, Daniel Ricciardo and Mark Webber — 69 percent of the time and outraced them 66 percent of the time in his career. Against Leclerc this season, those numbers are only 43 percent and 57 percent, respectively, and getting worse by the moment.
Vettel entered the season as a championship contender and the clear standard-bearer for the sport’s most storied team. Now his place is in doubt. With another year left on his contract, Vettel probably isn’t going anywhere (despite tabloid rumors to the contrary), but it’s hard not to juxtapose Leclerc’s recent surge against Vettel’s growing tendency toward crucial errors and on-track decisions that put other drivers at risk. So the biggest question for the season’s home stretch isn’t whether Leclerc is the future of the sport — that now seems established — but rather, it’s whether Vettel can avoid being left in the past.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

And boy, did it have it all. Inexplicable replay decisions! Calls blown dead that should not have been! Fires on the sidelines!


Our team is ON FIRE!! 🔥 ⚔️ @Titans #TitanUp pic.twitter.com/cQOXluTcvu
— Holly Turner (@tittleturner) September 15, 2019

So let’s get into it. How about the replay situation? Who could have possibly foreseen this being a huge mess?
joshua.hermsmeyer (Josh Hermsmeyer, NFL analyst): It’s funny — I was watching Tony Dungy on the Sunday Night Football halftime show going over plays that he deemed clear and convincing evidence of pass interference, and I disagreed with every one of them.
neil (Neil Paine, senior sportswriter): 😬
Salfino (Michael Salfino, FiveThirtyEight contributor): The cost of replay is being able to live the game you’re watching in the moment. And since replay is far from perfect and can never be perfect, why do we tolerate it?
neil: Because the alternative is missed calls! Except now you can inject questionable calls where there originally were none.
Take Sunday’s Seahawks-Steelers game. Trailing in the fourth quarter, Pete Carroll was able to successfully challenge this no-call, and it set up a go-ahead score. In real time, that didn’t look like pass interference. But in slow motion it did, and that is one of the big gray areas for this rule: How much contact is allowed before it becomes a “clear and obvious” hindrance to the receiver? In slow motion, things tend to look more “clear and obvious” than perhaps they were at game speed.
sara.ziegler: I’m reminded yet again that football is so arbitrary in so many ways.
Salfino: If you’re a coach, how do you know when to challenge? There is some kind of contact on most contested catches, if we’re going to Zapruder things.
neil: Yeah, so do you basically save it for any crucial incompletion in traffic late in a game, and just challenge no matter what on the off chance it works?
Salfino: Think of how bizarre things are in the NFL now, when the most game-changing events in games often involve replay rather than the live action on the field.
joshua.hermsmeyer: The live action has its own set of flaws, though. I think there’s a fundamental principle of fairness that people also enjoy and want in a sporting event.


I've always wondered how well NFL refs spot the ball so I went back using #BigDataBowl data and looked at the distance from where the ball actually stopped to where the refs spot the ball on the next play. Pretty satisfying results. @StatsbyLopez pic.twitter.com/uWHyiV8zlc

The refs, as we saw Thursday night, aren’t even all that great at spotting the damn ball.
Salfino: I guess it depends on whether you view refereeing a game as something that should be almost automated and perfect, or whether it’s just an organic part of the game with its variation in performance, just like the players. I totally get wanting 100 percent justice on the field, but it seems like it’s just never going to happen, for structural reasons. It’s not like the system can really be improved. It’s all one step forward and at least one step back.
joshua.hermsmeyer: The replay system and refs in general certainly aren’t helping Sean Payton and the Saints.
neil: That much is for sure, haha.
sara.ziegler: I don’t want to hear about it from the Saints, ever.

neil: To err is Favre-ian. Or referee-ian.
sara.ziegler: 🤣
Salfino: It’s incredible that the Saints again got screwed by a rule that made it impossible to fix the injustice we just witnessed on the field.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Al Riveron now posts an instant home office analysis on Twitter. They cut out the part where Cam Jordan runs it all the way back for a TD.

😂
neil: Can’t they just, as a rule, err on the side of waiting to blow the whistle?
Let it play out, and if you have to bring it back, bring it back.
sara.ziegler: That was incredible. I thought that’s what they’re told to do?
Salfino: If you wait for the whistle, you’re going to have guys getting blasted on many plays that should be dead.
joshua.hermsmeyer: If it’s close, they are told to let it play out on the field, but in practice it seems that rarely happens.
sara.ziegler: So on replay, what are our options? What can — or should — the league do?
joshua.hermsmeyer: I think the smartest thing to do — given the mountain of evidence that what’s driving a lot of the issues is the faulty original ruling on the field, and the deference given to those calls by the rule book — is to not privilege any evidence before review.
Salfino: I really want to go back to watching live action. I’d just scrap the entire thing. It was done before. Replay just can never be perfect, and perfection is its reason for existing.
neil: One of things coaches and commentators always beg for is consistency. Especially with regard to the PI challenges, which coaches are still trying to figure out, make what is “clear and obvious” consistent from week to week. Maybe this is just based on a few plays, but on Sunday it seemed like it was easier to overturn a PI non-call than it had been in Week 1.
Salfino: Short of scrapping it, I’d make the booth responsible for all reviews. There should be no limit on things. No strategic component to it.
sara.ziegler: The limit is frustrating, for sure, given how arbitrary it all seems now.
I guess it comes down to what the goal is. Is it to get the call perfectly right, every time? If it is, then the booth needs to be a lot more involved.
I don’t think that is the goal, FWIW, but I’m not sure exactly what the goal is.
neil: The goal is to avoid media and fan criticism. And it always fails.
sara.ziegler: LOL
joshua.hermsmeyer: Yeah by that measure, just delete the account.
Salfino: I thought overturning the Stefon Diggs touchdown was absurd. And there was an outbreak of questionable calls on Sunday besides that, most for very ticky-tack reasons.
sara.ziegler: Don’t even get me started on the Diggs TD.
Salfino: By the way, what the heck is wrong with Kirk Cousins? That game-losing interception was such a horrible decision. It was first down. Cousins is conservative when the situation calls to be desperate and desperate when conservatism is warranted. Sorry, Sara.
Also, Diggs doesn’t take off his helmet on what should have been the second TD if he doesn’t get robbed of the first TD, I would bet. That’s bad by Diggs, but it sure didn’t feel like justice was carried out on replay.
sara.ziegler: Yeah, that was just a whole mess.
neil: The Vikings really just did Vikings things to lose that one.
sara.ziegler: All right…..
neil: (Sorry.)
sara.ziegler: LOL
joshua.hermsmeyer: The Vikings running back is leading the league in rushing yards, so clearly these kinds of losses are just variance.
Run to win!
sara.ziegler: Dalvin Cook is a GENERATIONAL TALENT, Josh.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Glorious.
neil: 75-yard runs will really pad the totals.
sara.ziegler: ANYWAY.
Let’s move on to the other big issue of the weekend: injuries. We had two big injuries to older star quarterbacks — Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger. Roethlisberger is out for the season with an elbow injury; Brees will have thumb surgery and miss at least six weeks.
Salfino: Yeah, there was video on the sideline of Brees trying to pick up the ball. Imagine trying to do that without a thumb, and that’s how that went.
sara.ziegler: Ooof
joshua.hermsmeyer: There was something deeply sad about that footage. He tried to play it all off, and just walked away with his head down looking at his hand.
neil: One of the cool new features in our quarterback-adjusted NFL Elo prediction model is that we can quantify the effect of losing a star QB. And these are very damaging injuries. Roethlisberger and Brees are currently the fifth- and sixth-best starting QBs in our model, trailing only Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott, Tom Brady and Matt Ryan.
Our model instantly had the Steelers’ playoff odds dropping from 31 percent to 8 percent with the news about Roethlisberger:

The effect of Brees’ injury was a little bit less, because he could potentially come back for most of the second half of the season. New Orleans’s playoff odds dropped from 58 percent to about 51 percent, with Tampa Bay being the primary beneficiary of that dip. But in both cases, we’re talking about drop-offs that cause these teams’ chances of winning their next game to fall by 10 to 15 percentage points with the backup having to start.
sara.ziegler: Are injuries what will finally do these guys in?
neil: Injuries do seem to be what spells the end for old, productive QBs.
Salfino: It seems like Roethlisberger’s injury was likely wear and tear, while Brees’s was a fluke and not age-related. But playing through the injury, if that’s what Brees opts to do, is likely going to be much tougher at his age than it would have been at his peak.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Brees looked like he lost his fastball — or what was left of it — last year. There was a phantom/unreported injury in November where he took a big hit and stopped throwing deep. He didn’t appear to have much zip on it this year either. He attempted just one pass over 20 yards in Week 1. So I guess my money would be on Brees being the most impacted by this accumulation of injuries. He’s also older than Roethlisberger.
neil: People like our friend Bill Barnwell were already speculating before the season about Brees’s performance potentially collapsing this season after his struggles late last year.
Salfino: Do you go to the unknown with Taysom Hill or the known with Teddy Bridgewater? I would do the former: Try to inject athleticism and explosiveness into the position and worry less about floor.
joshua.hermsmeyer:

The drop off from Brees to Bridgewater was steep.
I think trying Hill — if Payton really believes he has some “Steve Young” in him — is the right move.
neil: Here’s a little bit more on the drop-offs between Brees/Roethlisberger and their backups. According to our model, replacing Brees with Bridgewater (who is roughly as good as Indy’s Jacoby Brissett, so the 29th-best starting QB in football) knocks the Saints’ Elo rating down from seventh in the league to 20th.
It gets worse for Pittsburgh. Replacing Roethlisberger with Mason Rudolph, who rates significantly lower than Ryan Fitzpatrick (the 32nd-best starter in the league), drops the Steelers from 17th in Elo to 31st, ahead of only the Dolphins.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Wow.
Salfino: I actually thought Rudolph looked good against Seattle. But it’s always tricky to judge the backups in the game when they are called upon because they play, I think, more free and easy since they had no idea they would be playing. The defense also doesn’t really know who they are. The test for Rudolph will be next week. He has draft pedigree to some extent.
sara.ziegler: Once again, BAN INJURIES.
Let’s wrap things up with a new game I’m calling Good Team/Bad Team. There’s a bunch of teams at 2-0 right now and a bunch at 0-2. But are they actually good/bad?
Starting with the 2-0 teams, I’ll name a team, and you tell me if that team is actually any good. Ready?
Salfino: I like this.
neil: Let’s go!
sara.ziegler: Let’s start with Buffalo! Did you know the Bills are 2-0?
joshua.hermsmeyer: The Bills are an eight-win team until Josh Allen gets injured on a scramble.
Salfino: The Bills are a bad team. They got lucky in Week 1: They played a QB with mono and then had the QB of the opposing defense (C.J. Mosley) go down, before which they hadn’t scored.
neil: Yeah, I agree with y’all. They may have swept the State of New Jersey in Weeks 1-2, but I’m not sure they’re actually any good.
Salfino: (OK, the Bills are not good but maybe not bad either; also, are the Giants tanking?)
sara.ziegler: The eternal question: Are the Giants tanking?
neil: Giants: Bad team.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Are people actually asking this question?
Salfino: Eli is 2-16 now in the first half of seasons from 2017 to 2019.
joshua.hermsmeyer: GM Dave Gettleman cannot abide a tank. They are just bad.
sara.ziegler: I think we know the Giants are bad, so we don’t really even need to discuss them.
What about San Francisco?
Salfino: San Francisco is good. I like their offensive coaching and play calling. They have very good offensive players — Matt Breida and Raheem Mostert are super-talented backs, especially Breida, who has some Barry Sanders in him. They look like they got it right with Deebo Samuel. The defense looks OK. I say 10-6.
neil: Good team…? The Niners currently rank third in EPA per game — granted, they beat a couple of mediocre teams (Tampa and Cincy) to get there. But Cincy held its own in Week 1 at Seattle! And Tampa won in Week 2 against Cam Newton and the Panthers!
joshua.hermsmeyer: The Niners were impressive in Week 2, but I’m not sold. It seemed like all the scheme stuff worked to perfection, and they didn’t need to really lean on Jimmy Garoppolo. In the first half of Week 1, they looked like the Niners we’ve seen the past two years, which is closer to my prior. So I’m gonna be the pessimist and say third in EPA/game is a bit of a mirage and that they aren’t a playoff team.
neil: San Francisco’s situation would also be rosier in a different division. The Rams and Seahawks are tough competition — our model thinks all three teams win double-digit games.
sara.ziegler: One more 2-0 team: Dallas!
joshua.hermsmeyer: Good.
neil: Good team! I wrote last week about how much it would help Dallas if Prescott became more consistent as a passer, and after two straight strong performances to start 2019 (on the heels of even more to close out 2018), it appears he may have turned a corner.
After that first interception, it seemed like “here we go again…” But he has been great since then.
Salfino: They’re good. For all the joking at Jerry Jones’s expense about how he takes over the team and doesn’t let the football people rule, they draft great every year. However they are doing it is working. Where is the weakness on Dallas? I don’t see one.
neil: With Philly being kinda all over the place so far, Dallas seems like clear NFC East favorites right now.
(Philly has actually been all over the place for like two years now…)
joshua.hermsmeyer: I think perhaps the biggest danger is that Kellen Moore runs out of plays three-fourths of the way through the year, and the league catches up. He’s never done a full season of this, and it seems to have happened to Sean McVay last year.
Salfino: Philly had such a spell of injuries on Sunday and still could have won if Nelson Agholor hadn’t dropped that touchdown pass down the sideline in the final two minutes. Carson Wentz often lacks pocket awareness and takes shots like Michael Vick used to take. If they can stay relatively healthy, I think the Eagles are at the Cowboys’ level.
sara.ziegler: OK, let’s move on to a few 0-2 teams to ask whether they’re actually as bad as they seem.
Washington!
Salfino: Bad.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Not as bad as they seem. They’ve been surprisingly good in the passing game, and that will earn them a few unexpected wins down the road.
neil: Not sure. Case Keenum has actually been OK-to-good so far. And their losses were against two teams we just said we considered good: Dallas and Philly.
(Anybody else VERY confused to see Keenum as No. 8 for Washington, and think it’s Cousins?)
joshua.hermsmeyer: Hah, yes!
Salfino: I agree that Washington has been decent on offense, but Keenum is going to be benched when the losses pile up. Dwayne Haskins reportedly is not remotely ready, but the fans and owner will demand him. So I guess I’m building seven-plus Haskins starts into the “bad” call.
Keenum is better than Cousins. (ducks)
neil: LOL
sara.ziegler: Hahaha
joshua.hermsmeyer: What a lukewarm take after Cousins’s performance this week, Mike. Shame.
neil: Our QB model agrees! (Barely.)
Salfino: Cousins is actually losing games now.
sara.ziegler: OMG, we can’t talk about the Vikings anymore, I’m sorry — I just can’t take it.
How about 0-2 Carolina?
joshua.hermsmeyer: What’s wrong with Cam Newton?
neil: I wish I could defend him and them. But he’s getting outplayed by Jameis Winston at this point. At home!
Salfino: I worry that Cam is broken down and forever Clark Kent now. He’s taken such a beating. We love the running QBs, but there is a price to be paid, and Cam may not be functional in his 30s because he can’t execute at an NFL level in structure in the pocket — he’s not a good enough passer.
joshua.hermsmeyer: If you’re right, then 0-2 is very, very real.
sara.ziegler: LOL
One more 0-2 team: Pittsburgh
neil: With Big Ben out, they’re in huge trouble. I mean, they were probably already in huge trouble anyway.
Salfino: It was ridiculous to think an offense could withstand the losses of Le’Veon Bell and Antonio Brown in consecutive years. JuJu Smith-Schuster is not a true No. 1 and is being thrust into that role without even a competent No. 2 receiver.
Pittsburgh is bad.
joshua.hermsmeyer: Agree with all of you. JuJu has been a hobby horse of mine as well. His efficiency last year was buoyed by the presence of AB and being asked to run routes near the seams and in the middle of the field — the best places to pass the ball. Without their starting QB, they are bad.
Salfino: And the thing about Ben aging — you don’t get the sense he’s focusing on diet and yoga. There is no BR7 program, I suspect.
neil: 🤣

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-suns-courtney-williams-is-thriving-on-midrange-jumpers/,2019-09-17,,,features,"Sep. 17, 2019",The Sun’s Courtney Williams Is Playing An Old-School Midrange Game — And It’s Working,Howard Megdal,FiveThirtyEight,WNBA,"Connecticut Sun head coach Curt Miller has an offensive philosophy built around making his players take the most efficient shot — typically chances around the rim or threes. The Sun, who face the Los Angeles Sparks in a best-of-five playoff semifinal matchup starting Tuesday, finished this season with the third-most efficient offense in the league after finishing atop the WNBA in 2018.
Even so, Miller realized that it was a mistake to try to turn his energy ball of a combo guard, Courtney Williams, into a model of the efficiency revolution that has altered the league’s offensive topography. “When we first got her, we tried to have her drive it more,” Miller said. “But she’s so good at getting those, what we call tough twos, we have just let her be what she’s going to be.”
In that way, Williams’s journey in Connecticut echoed the lessons she taught her college coach, Jose Fernandez of South Florida. “We told her, ‘Hey, get to the free-throw line more. You need to drive it more,’ Fernandez recalled. “But then, it was like … she just got where she got.”
That’s the deceptive simplicity of Williams’s game. She lets it fly from the dreaded midrange more than anyone in the WNBA — a combined 249 attempts from 10 to 19 feet, including a league-high 145 from 15 to 19 feet out. Williams also led the league in attempts from 15 to 19 feet in 2018 and finished second in 2017 to Indiana Fever forward Candice Dupree.
“I just do what I do,” Williams said. “I do what got me here. I feel like that midrange makes me stand out from other players.”
The other team with a double-bye in the playoffs, the Washington Mystics, is led by Elena Delle Donne and her three- and rim-heavy 50-40-90 season. So it may seem quixotic that the Sun are trusting a 5-foot-8 volume shooter from a spot on the floor considered inefficient. But to this point, both her methods and her path are anything but haphazard.
There’s an obvious WNBA comparison for what Williams is doing, and it’s one that she’s consciously tried to emulate: all-time great Cappie Pondexter.
“Cappie is my favorite player because I see so much of myself in her,” Williams said. “Being our size, pull-ups, being a scorer, being able to score at all levels anywhere on the floor, tattoos, don’t really care what nobody got to say about us. That’s how we look.”
The numbers reflect a close parallel between the two. Pondexter finished second in attempts from 15 to 19 feet in 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and led the WNBA in 2013. Her teammates see Pondexter in Williams, too.
“They’re really difficult to guard because they can score in all types of ways,” Sun point guard Jasmine Thomas said. “And they’re athletic. I think that’s the similarity that I see, that explosiveness, that confidence. I feel like most of us, we’ve got confidence, we didn’t get here by not being confident — but, it’s just like that swagger. Even if you miss four, five shots in a row, you know you got to make this sixth one.”
All the long twos, incidentally, haven’t kept Connecticut from getting a disproportionate amount of its points from beyond the arc — 27.7 percent of them, good for third-best in the league in 2019, up slightly from last season’s 26.0 percent, which was fourth in the league. Instead, Thomas sees the Connecticut attack as improved by Williams’s ability to rise and fire from a spot that defenses might ignore.
“There are shots to take that are hard shots to make consistently,” Thomas said. “And that is her game. If we can’t get layups, or if our three-ball isn’t falling down, we know that we can count on her to really take over a game and string together some shots. Even when you think she can’t get a shot off, she rises up over anybody and can shoot it.”
That’s another aspect to her game that isn’t accidental. While her jump-shot form can seem like a cross between natural athleticism and an almost supernatural motion, it really comes from hundreds of hours in the South Florida gym, getting off shot attempts with then-assistant coach Wil Bateast.
“He really just molded me,” Williams said. “He told me, ‘You just need to be great at one thing because when you get to that professional level, people are great at what they do. You need to be great at what you do.’”
So the drills would commence, with Bateast — who Williams said is “6-5, maybe 6-6” — with a hand in her face. She had to make 10 in a row, or she had to run sprints, halfcourt and back, and start over.
“Coming from the baseline and coming from halfcourt, coming from the sidelines,” Williams said. “Just anywhere on the court. You need to be able to get the shot off, it don’t matter where the defender is at. No matter how big, how tall, how small, how fast — you need to be able to get your shot off.”
Williams continues to evolve as a player. This season, she posted an assist rate of 23.2 percent, the best of her career, along with a steal rate of 2.4 percent, good enough for 16th among 60 qualified WNBA guards. And she’s anything but a one-dimensional scorer, either, hitting 56.5 percent of her shots inside of 5 feet, more efficient than bigs like Crystal Langhorne of the Seattle Storm and Reshanda Gray of the New York Liberty. She’s also continued to improve her 3-point shooting, hitting 45.7 percent from beyond the arc this year.
“There is still room for growth,” Miller said of Williams. “There are a lot of areas where she can continue to take that next step. And if she does that, she’s already one of the elite players in the league, [but] she truly has the potential to be a first-team All-WNBA-caliber player.”
But Miller doesn’t intend to change that trajectory. He’s learned, just as Fernandez did before him and just as defenders all over the league have since: When she rises, Courtney Williams is going to do what she does.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

14 days in prison
Actress Felicity Huffman was sentenced on Friday to 14 days in federal prison for her role in a conspiracy involving more than 30 other wealthy parents who are accused of paying thousands of dollars to boost their children’s credentials on college applications. Huffman is the first to receive a sentence, which also requires her to pay a $30,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. Her sentence has fueled discussions about inequality in both the education and criminal justice systems. [Vox]
3 JPMorgan Chase traders
Three JPMorgan Chase traders have been charged with market manipulation. The traders are accused of influencing the prices of gold, silver, platinum and palladium futures over the course of eight years. According to the Justice Department, the goal was to manipulate when and for how much other traders bought futures contracts. The indictments are the latest in a series of similar fraud cases. [CNN]
$1.50 bet
Does anyone still think swatting is funny? An Ohio gamer will serve jail time after his prank attempt turned deadly. Back in 2017, Casey Viner, who’s now 19, was upset about losing a $1.50 bet, so he had someone call in a fake hostage situation at what was meant to be his opponent’s address. It turned out the address was wrong, and a different man was killed by SWAT officers. Viner was sentenced to 15 months in jail, and the teen is also banned from online gaming for two years after his release. Still confused by this strange trend? You’re not alone. [New York Post]
Up to 50,000 auto workers
Auto workers across the country are fed up, and as many as 50,000 have gone on strike. “This is about standing up for us, the families and the communities that are affected because this is not just about our members,” said the union’s vice president after negotiations with General Motors broke down. Even a short strike could cost the automaker hundreds of millions of dollars. President Trump joined the discussion via tweet, encouraging the two sides to continue negotiating. [NBC News]
117-year-old synagogue
A man was arrested and charged with first-degree arson after a century-old synagogue burned to the ground last Monday. The house of worship was founded by Lithuanian Jewish immigrants and had served the community in Duluth, Minnesota, since 1901. None of the synagogue’s approximately 75 members were injured, but six Torah scrolls were destroyed. According to Police Chief Mike Tusken, “There is no reason to believe this is a bias or hate crime.” [The Washington Post]
Chapter 11 bankruptcy
In a move aimed at protecting itself and its owners, the Sackler family, from thousands of lawsuits, Purdue Pharma filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday. The OxyContin manufacturer blamed for igniting a nationwide opioid epidemic is planning to use the bankruptcy process to restructure, a plan it agreed to as part of a tentative settlement with many of the localities that had brought suit against it. The filing comes just two days after New York’s attorney general announced that her office had found a series of previously undisclosed wire transfers totaling nearly a billion dollars that were sent from the company to the Sacklers’ private accounts.

Can They Still Make The Playoffs?,Michael Salfino,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"On Sunday, injuries at the NFL’s most valuable position — to two of history’s most prolific passers — radically altered the landscape of the season.
Sean Payton is about to coach only the second game of his NFL career without a healthy Drew Brees, who is out six to eight weeks with an injury to his right (throwing) thumb that will require surgery. With Brees at the helm, Payton’s record is 119-72, and the pair has the second-most wins of any QB-coach combo in NFL history. Now, Payton’s quarterback is expected to be Teddy Bridgewater, who last started an NFL game that mattered in the 2015 season.1
In Pittsburgh, the situation is even worse: Ben Roethlisberger will undergo season-ending surgery on his throwing elbow. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin is 115-60-1 with Roethlisberger starting, the fourth-most wins of any QB-coach combo. Tomlin has had to guide his team through Big Ben’s missed time before, going 10-8 in games without Roethlisberger. But those previous fill-ins included veterans Charlie Batch, Byron Leftwich and an over-the-hill Michael Vick. Current backup Mason Rudolph, a third-round pick in the 2018 NFL draft, has never started an NFL game.
What can we expect from each team with their current backup QBs? The Saints still have a coin-flip’s chance to make the playoffs, according to FiveThirtyEight’s NFL prediction model. But the Steelers’ playoff chances are now practically nil — down to just 8 percent.
Even with Roethlisberger, the Steelers had started the season so poorly that, had he not gotten hurt, they still would have been projected for just 7.54 wins, or a record of roughly 8-8 — likely falling short of the postseason again. With Rudolph under center, the Steelers’ outlook drops by 2.47 expected wins. Because Rudolph has not yet started a game, the model projects his performance based purely on where he was drafted (the 3rd round) — which could be too bearish an estimate. But as things sit, Rudolph is expected to perform at only 36.6 percent of Roethlisberger’s Elo level, a rolling average of recent performances that incorporates both passing and running.

On paper, the Saints are in much better shape with their backup in Bridgewater, who is expected to perform at 56.5 percent of Brees’s level.2 With Brees starting every remaining game, the Saints would have been the seventh-strongest team in the league by Elo, with an expected win total of 9.62. With Bridgewater in, the Saints drop to 21st overall — and he lowers their projected win total to 8.93 for the full season.

But Bridgewater’s performance is almost impossible to project, given that he’s not the same player after recovering from the “horribly grotesque” injury that he sustained in 2016. Though the sample size is small — only 53 passes to date — Bridgewater’s returns as a Saint have been poor: He has notched nearly 2 yards fewer per pass attempt than as a Viking and has performed worse both by passer rating and ESPN’s QBR.
The Saints could turn to a Sean Payton favorite, quarterback and Swiss Army knife Taysom Hill, who receives zero Elo points because of his lack of NFL starts and his undrafted status. Payton, though, sees the next Steve Young. Hill is already 29 and in his third season of being groomed by Payton, but Young didn’t begin his Hall of Fame-caliber play as the 49ers’ primary starting QB until age 30. So if it’s ever going to happen for Hill, why not now?
For the Steelers, although Roethlisberger says he’s returning from this injury to finish out his contract, there are no guarantees. Eerily, the playing career of the last great Steelers quarterback, Terry Bradshaw, ended with an almost identical injury in the last game of the 1983 season. And Bradshaw also said he’d come back after his surgery, but he never did. He was 35. Roethlisberger is 37.
But what if the Steelers were able to get a veteran quarterback for next-to-nothing in a trade? And what if that player is a two-time Super Bowl champion, like Roethlisberger? The Giants are finally turning the page on the Eli Manning era, and it would be far less awkward for them to hand the team to rookie Daniel Jones with Manning gone than with him holding a clipboard. Elo projects Manning at nearly twice the value going forward this year as Rudolph, and he would be the AFC North’s third-best quarterback today in terms of Elo, ahead of Andy Dalton.
It appears, though, the Steelers lack the cap room to trade for Manning or even a modestly paid veteran QB. Pittsburgh sent a first-round pick to Miami on Monday for cornerback Minkah Fitzpatrick, so it doesn’t appear that the Steelers are intent on tanking. They’re probably just stuck with the uncertainty of a QB prospect who has yet to start a game.

Health Care? Climate Change?,Laura Bronner,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Part of the difficulty of picking winners and losers in a debate is that each voter brings a different rubric to the task. For example, a Democrat whose top priority is enacting stricter gun control may be looking for different things in a candidate’s performance than a voter whose sole objective is to get President Trump out of office. So to get a more nuanced picture of which candidates did well in last week’s third Democratic presidential debate, let’s break down reactions among these differently motivated voters.
To that end, our FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll, conducted using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, contacted the same set of respondents both before and after the debate and asked them what issue was most important in determining their vote in the primary. And by far, Democrats’ most common answer was the ability to defeat Trump — nearly 40 percent of respondents said this was their top issue. Health care, the economy, wealth and income inequality and climate change also ranked near the top of the list, though well behind a candidate’s ability to win.1 These priorities did not shift much after the debate either (all changes were within the poll’s 1.9-point margin of error).

From a survey of 4,320 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed between Sept. 5 and Sept. 11. The same people were surveyed again from Sept. 12 to Sept. 16; 3,473 responded to the second wave.
But although the issues voters prioritized didn’t change much, this question can tell us something else: whether voters’ priorities influence their views of the debate. Specifically, we can cross-reference which issues respondents said they cared about before the debate2 with how they graded each candidate’s performance afterward in order to answer the question of how each bloc of Democrats — climate-change Democrats, income-inequality Democrats, and so on — thought each candidate did.3
Take someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She got the highest overall marks for her debate performance (respondents gave her an average score of 3.3 out of 4), but she got even higher scores from voters who prioritized climate change or defeating Trump (3.5 from both groups). Her strength with the latter group could be an especially positive sign for her because Democrats seem to care deeply about winning this year. (What’s more, the share of respondents in our poll who said they thought Warren could beat Trump ticked up slightly after her debate performance.)
But Warren wasn’t the only candidate to get high scores from voters who said the most important issue was beating Trump. Former Vice President Joe Biden was graded higher by that group (scoring a 3.1) than by the respondent pool as a whole (3.0), though both scores were less impressive than Warren’s. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke also scored well with voters who prioritize beating Trump — they were the next-best performers after Warren (3.3 and 3.2, respectively).
Warren didn’t just score well with voters whose top issue was climate change or beating Trump — she was judged the top performer across all five voter groups we looked at.4 Among voters who prioritized health care and wealth and income inequality, however, she was neck-and-neck with Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has made single-payer health care and the redistribution of wealth big parts of his campaign. And among climate-change voters, Buttigieg and O’Rourke were once again close behind Warren. Warren scored the best with economy voters, too, but of the five issues we looked at, economy-focused Democrats gave candidates worse marks across the board, suggesting that they were unsatisfied by what they heard in the debate.
Of course, voters may be inclined to overrate the debate performance of their favored candidates, and their No. 1 issue is often linked to which candidate they prefer. (For example, two-thirds of the voters who said electability was their top priority were considering a vote for Biden before the debate, and 58.0 percent of those who prioritized wealth and income inequality were considering voting for Sanders.) So to ascertain whether the debate actually changed the minds of Democrats who prioritize these five issues, let’s look at the pre- to post-debate changes in which candidates these respondents were considering voting for.
Again, this looks like good news for Warren — she picked up potential supporters among these five voter groups — and bad news for former Cabinet secretary Julián Castro and Sen. Kamala Harris, who lost potential supporters across most of these issue areas. The two biggest increases in potential support were Warren’s increase among respondents who prioritized the economy and O’Rourke’s uptick among respondents who prioritized climate change. In Warren’s case, the share of economy voters considering her before the debate was much lower (22.4 percent) than the share of voters considering her overall (44.4 percent), so the increase served to shore up her potential support among a subset of respondents with whom she had been unusually weak. O’Rourke, however, had been doing fine among climate voters before the debate (15.6 percent), so his increase meant he now has a lot of support among that group of voters (21.4 percent of climate voters are now considering him, compared with 16.1 percent of all voters in our poll).
Other notable changes include Biden’s improvement among health care voters — he improved by 3.9 points. That means 57.6 percent of that group is now considering him, which is substantially more potential support than any other candidate got among these voters (Warren and Sanders, who have the second- and third-most potential support, are in the low 40s). And the two biggest decreases both belong to Harris, who saw a decline in potential support among both electability and health care voters.
Harris’s decline among electability voters bodes especially poorly for her because so many likely Democratic primary voters prize the ability to beat Trump over all other issues, which means that this voter group seems particularly key to the candidates’ chances. Meanwhile, Warren’s increase among these voters, though not that large in absolute terms (2.4 percentage points), does mean that she is now being considered by 54.2 percent of these respondents, trailing only Biden at 68.4 percent.
However, Biden’s dominance of this category is key to his overall support, and many political observers believe he will remain the front-runner as long as he retains his aura of electability. And although Warren made gains in this category after the third debate, so did Biden. Voters who prioritize defeating Trump became more likely to consider voting for him, to the tune of 1.6 percentage points. That suggests that it will take more than a rambling answer on segregation and attacks on his age to convince Democrats that Biden can’t beat Trump.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-marianne-williamsons-brand-of-spirituality-isnt-working/,2019-09-16,,,features,"Sep. 17, 2019",Why Marianne Williamson’s Brand Of Spirituality Isn’t Working,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer, two of the three nontraditional contenders in the 2020 race, have managed to secure covered spots in the next Democratic debate, beating out sitting senators, a governor, the mayor of the U.S.’s largest city and a clutch of current and former members of Congress. But the Democratic primary’s other unorthodox candidate — motivational speaker and self-help author Marianne Williamson — may be sitting on the sidelines.1
Something about Williamson’s unconventional candidacy, though, has certainly sparked voters’ curiosity. After all, a candidate who flits between the worlds of traditional, institutional religion and New Age spirituality is a rarity in presidential politics. And she was the most-searched candidate after the first night of the July debate, when she accused President Trump of harnessing the “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred” and declared that she wants “a politics that speaks to the heart.”
But the more voters learned more about her, the less they seemed to like her. According to an analysis by my colleague Nathaniel Rakich, Williamson’s name recognition is up, but her net favorability ratings are down. She now actually has negative net favorability, a dubious honor she shares only with mayor of New York Bill de Blasio and former Rep. Joe Sestak. And her failure to resonate with an audience that might have been receptive to her message — “spiritual but not religious” Americans — also reflects the difficulty of reaching a group that’s defined largely by what it’s not.
According to the Pew Research Center, about one-third of Democrats identify as “spiritual but not religious” — an amorphous identity that has a lot in common with Williamson’s nondenominational spiritual practice. She identifies as Jewish and still attends High Holiday services, but she also practices transcendental meditation. She rose to prominence as a commentator and teacher of “A Course In Miracles,” a mystical book published in 1976 whose author claimed to be dictating revelations from Jesus.
“She’s really the definition of spiritual but not religious,” said Laura Olson, a political science professor at Clemson University, about Williamson. “In that sense, she represents — and you’d think might be able to reach — a very sizeable group of Americans.”
Depending on how you measure it, between one-fifth and one-third of Americans identify as “spiritual but not religious.” It’s a group whose numbers have grown in recent years, as more and more people draw away from institutional religion. And like Williamson, most of the “spiritual but not religious” maintain some kind of link to an organized faith tradition. In fact, according to Pew, they’re about as likely to identify as Protestant as they are to say they’re religiously unaffiliated. But perhaps unsurprisingly, the vast majority are not churchgoers, nor do they necessarily have a strong sense of communal identity or group cohesion. And here we run into the hurdle that makes outreach to the less-religious and the non-religious perennially tricky for Democrats: It’s hard to marshal a group that doesn’t think of itself as a group.
It’s certainly unusual to have a presidential candidate making an explicitly spiritual argument for progressive politics on the campaign trail. But arguably, there was no reason to think that Williamson would reach such a diffuse group any more easily than the other Democratic contenders, even with a message that thrummed with spiritual overtones. Matthew Hedstrom, a professor of religion and American studies at the University of Virginia who studies liberal religion, told me that spiritual but not religious Democrats do see issues like the environment or gun control as morally tinged, but don’t necessarily look for a candidate who shares their specific religious orientation. “They’ll vote for a candidate who shares their outlook on values and issues,” Hedstrom said. “Whether they’re a liberal Christian, a Buddhist, a Jew — that matters less.”
So the bar was always high for Williamson to appeal to the spiritual-but-not-religious crowd — not only did she have to unite a nebulous group, but she also had to convince voters on the soundness of her policies rather than just her spiritual orientation. And although many aspects of her religious profile are shared by large numbers of people, it’s also not hard to see why some curious Democrats who took to Google to learn more about her message might have been turned off by where her particular spiritual journey has taken her.
According to Pew, people who identify as spiritual but not religious tend to be more highly educated than other religious groups, and that means they may be more leery of positions that fall outside the mainstream — of which Williamson has many. There is, for instance, her position on vaccines, which she had to repeatedly clarify after calling mandatory vaccinations “draconian” and “Orwellian” at an event in New Hampshire. Or her attacks on antidepressants, which she says are overprescribed and has suggested were to blame for some celebrities’ suicides. Williamson has claimed she’s being subjected to unfair scrutiny — for example, when she was ridiculed for appearing to suggest on Twitter that prayer and “the power of the mind” could change the path of Hurricane Dorian, she retorted that her view is “neither bizarre nor unintelligent.”
But even though many Democrats do believe that a higher power or spiritual force has acted in their lives in some way — whether to protect, reward, or punish them — that doesn’t mean they have an appetite for talk of supernatural intervention from someone seeking a great deal of earthly power. Williamson has made it farther in this year’s race than some more seasoned politicians, and she could theoretically end up in the October debate, but she’s still a long-shot. At this point, though, it’s hard to imagine what would cause voters to take Williamson seriously as a presidential candidate — even if there is something potent about her mystical political pitch and her belief that to solve the country’s problems, we need more than a set of policy plans.
In the end, despite the opportunities her unusual religious pedigree seemed to give her, Williamson seems to be running up against the same problem that other candidates on the left face when tackling the country’s changing religious dynamics. People who are less religious don’t have unifying values or principles that politicians can easily appeal to, and they don’t seem to be bothered by voting for someone who follows a different religious or spiritual path. What they want from politics might vary a lot — and at least this year, Williamson’s brand of spirituality doesn’t seem to be at the top of the list.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

But How Much Is Too Much?,Josh Hermsmeyer,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"New Head Coach Kliff Kingsbury and Arizona have brought a variant of the Hal Mumme Air Raid to the NFL, and while the Cardinals didn’t earn a Week 1 win — they tied the Detroit Lions in their home opener — the system lived up to its billing. Known for its spread concepts and heavy use of the forward pass, the Air Raid relies on a smart, accurate passer to distribute the ball to a bevy of playmakers sent into routes that attack all areas of the field. And spread they did. With first overall pick Kyler Murray running the offense, the Cardinals trotted out more four wide receiver sets (45) on Sunday than the rest of the NFL combined (36).
Clearly Kingsbury isn’t afraid to be different, but it comes with risks. Going four-wide is an approach that hasn’t typically paid off for NFL offenses. In the 2017 and 2018 seasons, NFL teams ran 1,185 plays from four-WR sets and ended up stubbing their toes. Over that fairly large sample, the expected points added per play across the league was negative, at -0.03 EPA per play. Meanwhile, teams found success featuring fewer wideouts, averaging positive EPA per play numbers with their personnel groups of two and three wide receivers.1 As we saw, the Cardinals were responsible for the majority of those plays, though, so it’s encouraging they performed slightly better than the league mean, earning -0.01 EPA per play.
The Air Raid encompasses a set of passing concepts that many teams have integrated into their schemes, so it’s not completely new. Andy Reid of the Chiefs incorporated parts of the Air Raid into his system to suit the specific strengths of Patrick Mahomes, Kingsbury’s former QB at Texas Tech. But the difference for the Cardinals may be in the details. Kingsbury used wide splits and 3×1 wide receiver sets often to stress the Lions defense with his four wideouts, and Murray improved as the game went on. Perhaps they have what it takes to make four-wide in the NFL successful.
But we also wondered: Wide receivers aside, does a team having more eligible receivers running routes lead to more production in the NFL? Or do offenses benefit when players stay in to protect their QB?

Based on success rate2 and EPA per play, the optimum number of receivers to send out into routes is three. NFL rules dictate that five receivers at most can report as eligible to catch a pass on any given play,3 so this finding would appear to support passing out of heavy sets with big tight ends staying home to help shore up the pass blocking. Or perhaps teams should keep a running back in the backfield to help chip rushing defenders. But it also could be that those heavier sets are effective because of the deception they afford via the play-action pass.
To find out, we broke out all plays by the number of receivers and then split the plays by play-action and non-play-action. When we look at the plays this way, we find that play-action accounts for all the efficiency we see from the plays with three or fewer receivers. When play-action snaps are removed, passes with three or fewer receivers have a negative expected value leaguewide.

If your goal is to fool your opponent into thinking you’re going to run the ball, bringing in a bunch of players who look like blockers is probably a good idea. That’s an intuitive finding that makes sense. Meanwhile, it’s also heartening to see that adding eligible receivers to the route design of a non-play-action passing play leads to greater passing efficiency. That’s also a finding that we’d expect — the more passing options the better!
It’s no surprise that play-action continues to show up as one of the most efficient play types in football. Analysts have been calling it the NFL’s corner three for years. But it’s still somewhat shocking to see just how pervasive and massive an effect a little deception can have on the success of an offense. It will be interesting to see how much play-action the Cardinals incorporate into their attack moving forward. With a healthy dose, along with the ability to successfully flood the field with wide receivers over the course of 16 games, Arizona shouldn’t stay near the bottom of our Elo rankings for long.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/zack-greinkes-8-pitch-types-keep-em-guessing/,2019-09-16,,,features,"Sep. 13, 2019",Zack Greinke Is One Of A Kind,Ari Levin,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"Just over a month ago, the Houston Astros pulled off the biggest move of the season: In a deal reported minutes after the trade deadline had passed, the Astros acquired Cy Young winner Zack Greinke from the Diamondbacks to form baseball’s best rotation alongside Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole, the two likeliest Cy Young candidates.
Greinke, a future Hall of Famer, has been stellar this season — a 2.99 ERA and a sub-1 WHIP. According to FiveThirtyEight’s pitcher ratings, he would be the top pitcher on two-thirds of teams and the No. 3 on just three — and that’s the one he’s on. The move already has paid dividends for the ‘Stros, who are 5-2 in Greinke’s starts and have baseball’s best run differential since the trade — by nearly 50 runs.
Now six weeks into team No. 6 (remember when he was traded to the Angels for the 2012 stretch run?), Greinke continues to adapt. At 35 years old, it’s anyone’s guess how long he can keep up this performance, but he’s signed through 2021 and should contribute through then. And because of the way he’s dealt with his decreasing velocity by relying on command and movement, he should be set up well for continued long-term success.
According to Statcast, Greinke throws eight pitches: four-seam fastball, changeup, slider, curve, sinker (or two-seam fastball), split finger, cutter and eephus. (We’ll get back to that last one.) Only Yu Darvish has as many listed on his Statcast page, with the same eight (though the classifications may hide some of Darvish’s arsenal). Anibal Sanchez, Rich Hill and Odrisamer Despaigne are the only pitchers with seven.
But it’s not just the variety of pitches that makes Greinke special. It’s how he throws them.
Consider his changeup. Greinke throws his offspeed on 21.9 percent of pitches — a fairly steady increase from 7.9 percent back in 2008. Yet as his fastball has lost velocity, from once hitting more than 100 miles per hour in 2010 to averaging below 90 in 2019, his changeup has gotten faster.

							Here, we point out that the goal of a changeup is usually to fool the batter by presenting a speed different from that of the fastball. Greinke does not do that.

— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) July 21, 2019

Instead, Greinke uses a power changeup with devastating late movement. Only Edubray Ramos has a smaller average speed difference. Greinke’s pitch has surpassed his slider, which used to be considered his best pitch, as the second option. Along with this, Greinke’s cutter, a staple of his arsenal in 2012 and 2013, has all but disappeared.
Then there’s the curveball, a slow sweeping pitch. Greinke’s curveball is the second-slowest among qualified starters, behind the Nationals’ Patrick Corbin, at just over 70 miles per hour.
This is where the eephus comes in. Greinke’s curve can be thrown so slow that Statcast registers it as the arcing pitch. But it’s not clear whether it’s a different pitch or just a curveball thrown slower. Nobody is throwing a true eephus, though six pitchers are credited with the pitch this year; only Greinke has one under 60 miles per hour. But even if you consider his eephus and his curveball as the same pitch, Greinke would still be tied with Sanchez and Darvish for the lead with seven different pitches.
MLB pitchers have struck out 16 hitters on sub-67 mph pitches this year. Greinke owns eight of those (and four of the rest are from position players) with his slow curve that can make batters look silly.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/d20e23b5-749c-4869-9845-d5b61e1ee064.mp4
The newest one is the split-finger, which he threw in April for the first time since pitch tracking began in 2008. He’s thrown five so far in 2019, including three to Jacob DeGrom in the same at bat. If he’s experimenting with it now, there’s a chance it becomes a regular part of his arsenal in the future, especially with the Astros’ penchant for getting the most out of pitch selection.
But beyond his wide repertoire of pitches, Greinke’s pitching style is one of a kind. He throws most pitches low but gets strikes. Even though he throws fewer pitches in the strike zone than average, he almost never falls behind. And his .198 wOBA allowed on pitches out of the zone is second in MLB, also behind Corbin.
Greinke has faced just 11 3-0 counts this year and had thrown a fastball every time, almost always on the edge, until he gave Christian Yelich a perfect changeup last week. None of the 20 other pitchers with as many pitches this year has seen fewer than 15 such counts. In the month of July, Greinke threw 479 pitches and none was in a 3-0 count. He threw eight pitches with a 2-0 count — seven were in the strike zone and the other was fouled off. He’ll throw in the strike zone when he falls behind; that just doesn’t happen very often. And even when he does, batters can’t take advantage — they’re just 2-16 on 2-0 counts this year despite seeing 65 percent of pitches in the strike zone.
When he’s ahead, it’s a different story. That’s when the sub-70 curveball becomes devastating. Ahead in the count, Greinke throws just 27 percent of pitches in the strike zone; the league average is 38 percent. And 76 percent of his strikeouts have been on pitches out of the zone, well higher than the league average of 56 percent. And his plan of attack is to go low. On 1-2 counts, specifically, Greinke throws in either the lower third or below the strike zone more often than any other pitcher.
Greinke is truly a unique pitcher. His fastball and offspeed have nearly the same velocity, but his curveball is one of the slowest. He throws outside of the strike zone but never falls behind, and batters can’t seem to figure out any of his pitches.
Through his impressive career, the one thing Greinke lacks is a ring. He has 11 postseason appearances, but his biggest impact was probably his lone start in the 2014 NLDS (in which he scored more runs than he allowed in seven innings). He makes the top 10 list of career games started without a World Series appearance. But if he earns a huge postseason moment, he could move from likely Hall of Famer to potentially first ballot. Perhaps he’ll have that chance in Houston this October.

At least eight teams1 have a real chance at an NBA title in what could be the most open race the league has seen in years.
But somewhere in the next rung of teams — likely not title contenders, but competitive — is what may be the most-certain-to-be-interesting-no-matter-what team: the New Orleans Pelicans. The Pels enter a new era, looking nothing like before, with little to no sense of how good they, or No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson, will be.
While it’s fair to expect that it will take time for the Pelicans to take stock of what they have, don’t be surprised if New Orleans figures things out relatively quickly. Based on recent history, it’s not a longshot that they could reach the postseason in their first season without Anthony Davis.
Put aside the fact that FiveThirtyEight’s projection model has the Pelicans as the eighth-most likely playoff team out West, with a 52 percent probability of reaching the postseason. That’s based on player projections. There’s also the simple math of how not-so-horrible teams2 have fared the past two decades after winning the lottery and landing the No. 1 pick.
Remember, the Pelicans got lucky in landing the top overall pick. As a result, they’re a relatively good team as far as lottery winners go. Of the eight previous clubs to defy the odds and win the No. 1 pick without being a total cellar dweller,3 six saw considerable improvement, winning at least eight more games than they did the previous season. That sort of jump would be meaningful for New Orleans, which, with 33 wins last year, would find themselves at .500 or better. It’s also worth noting that the Pelicans’ 33 victories also rank as tied for the most among those lottery winners over the past two decades, which suggests they’ll be starting from a more favorable position than most.

The Clippers technically won the lottery in 2011 with the NBA’s eighth-worst mark. But they had previously traded the rights to their pick to Cleveland, who ended up taking Kyrie Irving with the top pick that year.

Of course, even among just these eight teams, there’s a fairly wide range of outcomes and some unique circumstances. Some of these clubs that made seismic leaps were highly unusual. Take the 2014 Cavs, for example: Yes, Cleveland improved by 20 victories year-over-year after winning the lotto. But a guy named LeBron James deciding to sign there that summer was pretty integral to that leap. So was Kevin Love, whom the Cavs dealt for after drafting No. 1 pick Andrew Wiggins. (On the other hand, Toronto getting 20 games better in 2006-07 after drafting Andrea Bargnani is one that can’t be explained anywhere near as easily.) Simply put, other roster moves are obviously a key factor in whether a team can make a significant jump after landing the top pick.
But the No. 1 pick matters too. The Pelicans would gladly take the same sort of early returns from Zion as the 2008 Bulls or 2002 Rockets got from Derrick Rose and Yao Ming, respectively: Stars with bona fide skills, who made immediate impacts before struggling with injuries years later. The Bulls were eight games better after drafting their future MVP, while Houston won 15 more games after taking Ming. Both players ended up with clubs that had at least one other building block, much like Williamson will have in Jrue Holiday, one of the league’s steadiest — if not most underrated — players.
Aside from Williamson and Holiday, New Orleans also has the trio of young players — Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart — that came over in the Davis trade. It remains to be seen if any of them will become stars (Ingram had a torrid end of the season before being forced out with a blood clot in his right arm). But even if they don’t,4 they still look like solid rotation players: Ball has shown to be one of the NBA’s better defending guards when healthy, Ingram has length and has flashed an elite level of scoring ability, while Hart is quietly one of the most sure-handed transition players in the sport.
As far as other roster changes, David Griffin also brought in sharpshooter JJ Redick, who gives the club added spacing, and ex-Jazz big Derrick Favors to help on the glass and to give the team a rim protector without Davis.5
While it’s probably a bit soon to know what sort of team the Pelicans will be in light of all these changes, it seems a safe bet that coach Alvin Gentry’s uptempo mentality will continue with this group, particularly as the hyperathletic Williamson finds his way within the offense and the league. New Orleans was poor defensively last season, but the potential is arguably there for the club to become a top-10 group in the coming years, with what should be four plus defenders (Holiday, Ball, Williamson and Favors) and a fifth in Ingram who has the ability to be amazingly disruptive at times despite his slender build.
But the truth is, we don’t know how it will look just yet, because of all the new pieces. All we know — with 20 nationally televised games on ESPN, TNT and ABC — is that we’ll have a lot of chances to watch it all come together for the Pelicans, and that judging off how teams like the Pelicans often do shortly after landing the top pick, maybe New Orleans will actually be worth the Zion-level hype.

Each network’s daily news coverage is chopped up into 15-second clips, and each clip that includes a candidate’s name is counted as one mention. For both cable and online news, our search queries look for an exact match for each candidate’s name, except for Julian Castro, for whom our search query is “Julian Castro” OR “Julián Castro.” Media Cloud searches use two of the database’s publication lists: “top online news” and “digital native” publications.

While Warren took the No. 2 spot in media mentions for the week (which includes the days leading up to the debate), if we look only at data from the two full days of coverage after the debate ended,3 former Rep. Beto O’Rourke was mentioned in more in 15-second cable news clips than Warren across the three channels we monitor — CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. During the debate, O’Rourke said “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We’re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.” Those comments loomed large in the media coverage of the debate: 38 percent of 15-second cable news clips that mentioned O’Rourke during that time also mentioned “gun” or “guns,” making it the most mentioned word in clips that talked about O’Rourke.4
Biden was still mentioned in more than twice as many cable news clips as O’Rourke in the two days after the debate, though. Unlike after the first debate, when Sen. Kamala Harris came very close to matching Biden’s share of media mentions, the data so far doesn’t show that any other candidate substantially challenging Biden’s hegemony in cable news.

Ipsos interviewed the same group of likely Democratic primary voters twice — before and after the debate — and the poll found that the share of respondents who said they were considering voting for each candidate largely remained the same. Nor did the debate help voters eliminate some choices: The average number of candidates voters said they were considering (2.5) remained unchanged. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t important shifts in the race.
If the debate had a winner, it probably was Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Although the share of voters who were considering supporting her went up by only 2.4 percentage points, it was the biggest increase in the field. She was also the only one of the top three candidates to gain potential supporters; former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders both lost ground. In addition, Warren received the highest marks for her debate performance from respondents in the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel.
The third debate may have also shaken up the second tier of candidates. For example, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris now have roughly equal numbers of people thinking about voting for them. (Going into the debate, Harris had about a 6-point lead over Buttigieg on this question.) Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has long been foundering in the polls, saw a 7-point uptick in his net favorability rating (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating), meaning he made a positive impression on voters, though it did not meaningfully increase the percentage of Democrats who were considering voting for him. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker also saw modest increases in both their net favorability rating and the share of respondents who were considering them. But former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, who has struggled to break out, may have landed himself in jeopardy. Castro had the biggest drop in net favorability rating (it dropped 10 points) and received the lowest marks for his debate performance.
So what do we know about the voters driving these changes? Well, the biggest thing we know is that the 1,465 respondents who watched the debate reacted much more strongly than the 2,004 respondents who did not watch. This is certainly no surprise, but it suggests that the secondhand messages (like news coverage and social media reactions) that non-watchers may have been exposed to didn’t affect their opinions very much. For example, most of the movement in O’Rourke’s and Castro’s1 net favorability ratings was driven by debate watchers. In fact, opinions on O’Rourke barely moved among those who didn’t watch the debate.

From a survey of 3,473 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed between Sept. 5 and Sept. 11 and again from Sept. 12 to Sept. 16, of whom 1,465 watched at least some of the debate and 2,004 did not watch (four people did not answer the question).
Overall, debate watchers developed more positive feelings toward just over half the field, including O’Rourke; businessman Andrew Yang saw a small drop, though not nearly as large as Castro’s, and Sanders and Harris saw little change. However, among non-watchers there was far less movement. Their opinions changed by more than a point for only three candidates — Warren, Booker and Castro — with Warren the only one who improved her standing in their eyes. Castro had the biggest drop here too, but Booker also decreased in the estimation of non-watchers, which is a little odd, considering he had the second-biggest boost in his net favorability ratings among those who watched the debate.
Finally, let’s turn to the question of whom Democrats are considering voting for and how it differed between debate watchers and non-watchers. Interestingly, the two respondent groups moved in opposite directions for seven of the 10 candidates.

For example, Buttigieg picked up ground among debate watchers but got less popular among non-watchers, and the same was true for Booker, Klobuchar, O’Rourke and Yang. Meanwhile, Biden and Sanders lost potential supporters among debate watchers but gained among non-watchers. This could be a result of noise in the data, but it could also reflect how, according to other polls, those two remain more popular among voters who are not highly informed or have yet to tune into the race.
Harris was notable in that she was the only candidate whose change in support was greater among non-watchers than among watchers — and both were negative, which helps explain why she lost the most potential voters of any candidate. Likewise, Warren was the only candidate who gained more potential voters among both watchers and non-watchers, which is another point in favor of her “winning” the debate, however small that victory might be.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-use-general-election-polls-to-try-to-predict-the-primaries/,2019-09-13,,,features,"Sep. 16, 2019",Don’t Use General Election Polls To Try To Predict The Primaries,Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"We know we’ve told you that early general election polls are pretty meaningless in predicting who will win the presidency at this point in the election cycle, more than a year in advance, but we were curious: Could they tell us anything about how a candidate might perform in the primary?
For better or worse, general election polls are often used as one way to think about a candidate’s electability. For example, Joe Biden, as part of his argument for why he should be the Democratic nominee, has touted his performance in polls that ask voters who they’d support in a head-to-head matchup between Biden and President Trump. But the problem is, there’s a lot we don’t know about electability, and as a result, the debate around it can be pretty ill-informed, as voters don’t necessarily think about electability in a rational way. Plus, the data we have available for analyzing whether a candidate is (or isn’t) electable is often flawed, or limited, making it hard to draw firm conclusions. So in the leadup to the 2020 election, one thing we at FiveThirtyEight are trying to do is explore what kind of data we can use to improve our understanding of electability and what that means for the current presidential race.
First up, do early head-to-head polls like the ones Biden has cited tell us anything about how well a candidate will do in the primary? To test this idea, we collected polls conducted in the last half of the calendar year before the primary (July to December) and built two models to predict how each candidate would ultimately do in the nomination contest: One model used polls of the primary race and candidates’ name recognition, and the other model used those two factors plus incorporated how well the candidates did in head-to-head polls of the general election. We then compared the two models to see if adding in the general election polls improved our modeling. So, to spoil the ending a bit, do head-to-head polls help us predict who will win the nomination when we already know where candidates stand in the primary polls? The short answer is: No, they don’t seem to help much at all.
Now, we do know there is a relationship between what share of the national primary vote total that a candidate wins and a combination of their poll average and name recognition,1 it’s just that adding in a variable for how well the candidate is doing in polls that pit them against the opposing party’s eventual nominee doesn’t actually improve our ability to predict how much of the national primary vote share a candidate will win.
To build our models, we looked at the last four presidential cycles (from 2004 to 2016). The first version of the model incorporated both a candidate’s average standing in national primary polls and their estimated level of name recognition, numbers drawn from the second half of the calendar year (July through December)2 before a competitive presidential primary.3 Then we made a second version that used all the same data, plus each candidate’s average margin (how much they led or trailed their hypothetical opponent by) in polls that tested them against the opposing party’s eventual nominee in general election polls from the same time period.4 These variables were fed into two linear regression models to see how well each model predicted the national primary vote. (You can see some of the data that was feeding our models in the table at the bottom of the page.) What we found was that adding in a candidate’s average margin in general election polls didn’t change how well the models fit the national primary vote data.5 In other words, knowing a candidate’s standing in general election polling didn’t improve how well we could predict what percentage of the national primary vote a candidate might win.
But the number of prominent candidates and the competitiveness of each primary race can differ from cycle to cycle and affect the distribution of the national primary vote — a huge field of candidates could mean that a lot of people got a decent percentage of the vote, whereas a cycle in which a single strong candidate sails to the nomination over a few weaker competitors could concentrate most of the vote into one person’s camp. So we decided to do a second check of whether general election polls made primary predictions better. This time, we looked at whether those head-to-head polls helped us to better predict a candidate’s chances of winning the nomination, rather than concentrating on their share of the primary vote. After all, no matter how a primary goes, there’s just one nominee in the end. But it turns out that a candidate’s average general election margin doesn’t tell us much about the chances that a given candidate will become their party’s presidential nominee.6 To borrow an example from a recent presidential cycle, the fact that Jeb Bush had an average deficit of 2.8 percentage points against Hillary Clinton in general election polls from the second half of 2015 probably didn’t do much to change his chances of winning the GOP nomination even though he polled better than Trump, who trailed Clinton by an average of 6.5 points during that same time period.
So why might general election polls not tell us more about a candidate’s performance in the primary? Well, it could be that voters are factoring in a candidate’s perceived electability when they decide who to support, which means that their assessment of who can win the general election is reflected in candidates’ polling average in the primary polls. Voters may not always have complete information about the general election — one limitation of this study is that, in cycles where neither party had an incumbent running for reelection, primary voters didn’t necessarily know who their party’s eventual nominee might end up running against — but we actually have one statistical point in favor of the idea that they are factoring electability into their votes: There was a relatively strong correlation between a candidate’s primary poll average and their average general election margin in our data set.7 That is, the better a candidate performed in the primary polls, the better that candidate tended to poll in general election trial heats against the other party’s eventual nominee.
All of this doesn’t mean that general election polls don’t matter at all — 2020 Democratic voters are probably considering them when thinking about how well a candidate might perform against Trump. But they’re not very useful for anticipating who will be the Democratic nominee next year when we already have the primary polls to look at.

General election margin is average margin in percentage points of polls measuring a candidate against the other party’s eventual presidential nominee. Primary percentage is an average of national primary polls for each candidate. The national primary vote is each candidate’s vote share in all primaries for that election cycle. The second half of the year before a primary is July through December. Competitive primaries are those in which no incumbent is running for that party.

145 CEOs
The pressure is mounting to act on gun control. The CEOs of 145 companies sent a letter to members of the Senate on Thursday stating that inaction is “simply unacceptable.” The companies represented include Uber, Twitter, TOMS and Airbnb. “Every day, 100 Americans are shot and killed and hundreds more are wounded,” the letter states. The leaders are calling for stronger background checks, in addition to a red flag law. [NPR]
10.8 million children
Integration is still a challenge for most U.S. school districts, but a number have seen improvements. A Washington Post analysis found that 10.8 million children attended highly integrated public schools in 2017, compared with 5.9 million in 1995. The trend highlights drastic demographic changes taking place in small towns and suburbs that were once overwhelmingly white. Meanwhile, many children in big cities remain in deeply segregated districts. [The Washington Post]
$1.6 million
In Florida news, a fortune teller is headed to jail. A Florida woman has been sentenced to 3.5 years in prison for conning another woman out of $1.6 million. The fortune teller said she needed the money to remove a curse on the other woman’s family. According to the grand jury, the fortune teller represented herself as having “God-given powers that enabled her to help people afflicted with curses.” She later admitted to the victim that there was never a curse, ultimately pleading guilty to wire fraud. [NBC News]
$400 million lawsuit
CBS is getting sued. Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax filed a $400 million defamation lawsuit on Thursday against CBS after it reported on allegations of sexual assault against Fairfax. Earlier this year, the network aired interviews between Gayle King and Fairfax’s accusers Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson. Fairfax has denied the accusations, but CBS is not backing down. “We stand by our reporting and we will vigorously defend this lawsuit,” CBS News said in a statement to The Hill. [The Hill]
$3 billion in cash
It’s a big moment for the Purdue Pharma opioid cases. Thousands of plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against the opioid manufacturer that is accused of contributing to the nationwide epidemic. The company’s owners, members of the Sackler family, have now tentatively reached the first comprehensive settlement. The family does not admit any wrongdoing, but would pay $3 billion in cash over seven years under the proposal. Still, the fight isn’t over. A number of state attorneys general have denounced the plan and promised to come after the Sackler fortune. Sounds like these states came to battle. [The New York Times]
6,106 home runs
MLB players are smashing balls and smashing records. Wednesday night, the Baltimore Orioles’ Jonathan Villar hit the league’s 6,106th home run of 2019, breaking the record set two years ago for the most runs in a season. So, what’s causing this surge? A ball’s spin rate off the bat could have something to do with it. There’s less spin this year than last year, and excessive spin might lead to batted balls traveling higher, but not farther.

Poll(s) of the week
Amid headlines about racist tweets, trade wars and hurricane maps, President Trump’s approval rating has dipped slightly since the middle of July. On Tuesday, it stood at 41.0 percent, down from 43.0 percent on July 22 in FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker. While his approval rating was at 41.6 percent as of Thursday at 5 p.m. ET, this is about as low as Trump’s approval rating has been since the end of the government shutdown this past January.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post found Trump’s approval rating at 38 percent, 6 points lower than the president’s approval rating in an early July survey. The new poll also showed that net approval of the president’s handling of the economy is slightly underwater, with 46 percent approving and 47 percent disapproving. This is notable, as the public has been more receptive to Trump’s handling of the economy compared to other issues. The president has — at least in part — attached his reelection fortunes to strong economic conditions. But even more troubling for Trump is that the ABC News/Washington Post poll also found that 60 percent of Americans believe a recession is somewhat or very likely to happen sometime over the next year. And as my colleague Nathaniel Rakich wrote last week, even some Republicans are starting to sour on Trump’s handling of the economy, so a deterioration in attitudes about the economy and the president’s stewardship of it could hurt his overall standing.
However, as I wrote earlier this year, Trump’s approval rating has held remarkably steady. As of March, half of Trump’s approval polls during his time in office had him between 39 and 44 percent. Since then, his average approval has hovered between 41 and 43 percent.
Given the consistency of Trump’s approval rating, I wouldn’t read too much into the latest downward trend. It could tick back up a notch or two before too long. At the same time, his approval rating was mediocre, even when it sat a couple points higher, so steadiness isn’t exactly a great sign for Trump. If it doesn’t notably improve, Trump’s approval might sink him in 2020.
Other polling bites
A new Univision survey, conducted by Latino Decisions and North Star Opinion, found former Vice President Joe Biden with a narrow edge among Hispanic voters across the country. Biden led the poll at 22 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders at 20 percent and former Cabinet secretary Julián Castro — the lone Hispanic candidate in the Democratic field — at 12 percent. The poll also looked at Hispanics in Texas and found former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke leading with 26 percent support in the Lone Star State.
The latest national survey from CNN/SSRS found that 36 percent of American adults think Trump “deserves to be reelected” while 60 percent do not. The gap narrows slightly among registered voters: 39 percent said yes and 58 percent said no. One silver lining for the president is that these results are somewhat better than the last time CNN asked this question in November 2017, when just 33 percent of adults thought he deserved to be reelected and 63 percent though he did not.
For Democrats, the ability to defeat Trump remains a top consideration when selecting a Democratic presidential nominee. In a new survey from National Public Radio/PBS NewsHour/Marist, 58 percent of Democrats1 said that a candidate who can beat Trump was more important than a candidate who shares their position on most issues. This marked an increase from July, when 54 percent of respondents said beating Trump was more important, and June, when 46 percent said this.
New polling from USA Today/Ipsos found that 37 percent of likely Democratic primary voters felt Biden had the best chance of beating Trump, ahead of Sens. Sanders (20 percent) and Elizabeth Warren (16 percent). And while 88 percent of likely Democratic primary voters said they would be comfortable having a female president, just 44 percent thought their neighbors would be comfortable with a woman in the White House, which could be troubling for female candidates trying to convince voters they can beat Trump.
Coming into Thursday night’s Democratic primary debate, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 55 percent of Democrats2 preferred someone who wants to build on the Affordable Care Act to expand health care coverage and lower costs, compared to 40 percent who preferred someone who would replace the ACA with a national Medicare for All plan. Among the broader public, 69 percent of Americans said they favored a public option for health insurance while 53 percent favored Medicare for All.
With mass shootings on the rise in the U.S., Gallup found that 48 percent of Americans are “very” or “somewhat” worried that they or someone in their family will be a victim of one. Thirty-nine percent of respondents said the same in 2017, and 38 percent in 2015.
Wednesday marked the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. A new study from Pew Research Center compared the experiences of veterans who served before and after 9/11. Pew found that post-9/11 veterans were more likely to have been deployed at least once (77 percent) and serve in a combat zone (58 percent) than pre-9/11 service members (58 percent and 31 percent). The report also found that post-9/11 veterans were more likely to have suffered post-traumatic stress (36 percent) than pre-9/11 veterans (14 percent).
Our neighbors north of the border officially have an election date: Canada will vote for a new parliament on Oct. 21. Polling shows a tight race between the Liberals, the current governing party, and the Conservatives, the opposition party — but the Liberals may have a geographic advantage when it comes to winning seats given their strength in Ontario and Quebec.
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 41.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.7 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -12.1 points). At this time last week, 41.4 percent approved and 53.9 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -12.5 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 42.0 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.3 percent, for a net approval rating of -11.3 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.6 percentage points (46.4 percent to 39.8 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 6.5 points (46.3 percent to 39.8 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.3 points (46.2 percent to 39.9 percent).

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-third-democratic-debate-in-7-charts/,2019-09-13,,,features,"Sep. 13, 2019",The Third Democratic Debate In 7 Charts,Laura Bronner,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"For the first time this cycle, there was just one debate night, and only 10 candidates made the cut — so now we’re trying to make sense of what happened when the front-runners shared the stage. In recent weeks, the polls have shown a top tier of three to five candidates, with former Vice President Joe Biden leading, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren tied for second, and Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, a distant fourth and fifth — but did that change last night?
Some candidates from the lower-polling tiers had strong performances — former Rep. Beto O’Rourke delivered an impassioned speech on gun violence and Sen. Cory Booker spoke nearly as much as Biden, though Booker is only polling at 2.1 percent on average (based on 21 debate-qualifying polls). But as you can see from the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, the overall picture hasn’t shifted much yet — although Warren does seem to have done the most to boost her campaign. Here’s what we’ve learned so far about what viewers made of the debate and the candidates’ performances:
Which candidates wowed the crowd?
First of all, how did viewers in our poll think the candidates did on Thursday night? To answer this, we compared debate-watchers’ ratings of the candidates’ performances to their pre-debate favorability scores1 to see if any well-liked candidates failed to impress or if anyone got high marks despite lower favorability. By this measure, O’Rourke and Warren were the biggest standouts, though Buttigieg and Booker also made a positive impression. But Biden and former Cabinet secretary Julián Castro — who memorably clashed — got the lowest scores relative to their pre-debate favorability.
 
Who gained (or lost) potential supporters?
Another way to assess who won last night’s debate is to see who convinced more voters to at least think about voting for them. Most candidates saw some change in the share of likely Democratic primary voters who were considering supporting them, though not all changes were positive. Warren, for example, saw the biggest increase in voters who were considering her — almost 4 percentage points, while Harris lost more than 2 percentage points of potential support. But for most candidates, the numbers stayed pretty much the same as they had been before the debate. Even for those whose debate performance stood out — like Biden and Castro, who got relatively poor grades, or O’Rourke, who got a strong rating — there was little change in how many likely primary voters said they were considering voting for them.
Which candidates appeal to the same voters?
With many voters in our poll still considering multiple candidates, we were also interested in examining which candidates share potential supporters. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the two candidates who are being considered by the most voters in our poll — Biden and Warren — also tended to draw a high proportion of other candidates’ supporters, too. Seventy percent of Buttigieg’s supporters are also considering Warren, for example, while 65 percent of O’Rourke’s supporters are also considering Biden. Although many respondents in our survey said they were considering Sanders, fewer of his supporters are considering supporting other candidates. In fact, Biden and Sanders had the most exclusive supporters — 24 percent of Biden’s supporters and 18 percent of Sanders’s supporters aren’t considering any of the other candidates who participated in the debate.
Who made a positive (or negative) impression?
You can also look at the change in candidates’ favorable and unfavorable ratings to understand who got people feeling more positively about them (or perhaps gained unwanted notoriety). So after Ipsos polled voters before and after the debate, we calculated the change in candidates’ net favorability (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating). O’Rourke may not have picked up many potential supporters, but he did improve his net favorability rating by more than 8 points with his debate performance. Castro, meanwhile, took the largest hit, dropping 6.7 points in net favorability, which could be related to his heated exchanges with Biden.

Who spoke the most?
Though respondents to the FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll thought Biden’s debate performance was less impressive than Warren’s, it wasn’t because he didn’t get a chance to talk. Of all the candidates on the stage last night, Biden had the highest word count, with over 3,000 words spoken. Booker and Warren, the next two most prolific speakers, were about 600 and 750 words behind, respectively.

Booker’s place as the second-most-prolific talker is even more impressive considering that he’s polling in the low single digits. (The polling average is based on 21 debate-qualifying polls released between June 28 and Aug. 28.) Castro also spoke more than anticipated given his polling average (1 percent), holding the floor for longer than both Buttigieg and Sanders. Sanders, in fact, had the second-highest polling average going into the debate, but was third from the bottom in words spoken, beating out only O’Rourke and businessman Andrew Yang.

Harris was the clear leader, mentioning Trump 11 times, though as a group, the candidates talked about Trump considerably less often than they did in either night of the second debate. And some of the candidates who spoke the most, such as Biden and Warren, seemed to avoid Trump, each mentioning the president only once. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, meanwhile, got through the whole debate without saying Trump’s name even once.


So did the single-night debate change the game? Thursday night’s debate drew about 14 million television viewers, which is more viewers than both nights of the second debate, but still slightly fewer than those who tuned into watch the first debate. And if our poll with Ipsos is indicative of voters’ reactions, then the needle didn’t move all that much. But for those of you who preferred the two-night approach, you might be in luck — the fourth debate, set for Oct. 15 and potentially Oct. 16, might be split across two nights, since at least 11 candidates have qualified so far. (The Democratic National Committee hasn’t yet confirmed what it will do, however.) Either way, we’ll be here live blogging, so stay tuned!

89-79
Team USA took an L on Wednesday. France beat the U.S. 89-79 in the quarterfinals of the 2019 FIBA World Cup, booting them from the competition. The defeat ended Team USA’s 58-game winning streak and squashed their hopes of winning a third consecutive FIBA gold medal. The loss comes after a number of top-tier NBA players declined to participate in the World Cup this year. The team still managed to qualify for next year’s Olympic games in Japan, but some roster changes could be on the horizon. [CBS Sports]
About $90,000 worth of cakes
Uh … did you know there’s a black market for luxury baked goods? I sure didn’t. A New York deliveryman has been accused of swiping about $90,000 worth of cakes from a warehouse for Lady M Confections. The boutique New York bakery has been raved about by Oprah, Martha Stewart and other big names. The alleged thief, David Lliviganay, is said to have smuggled out 1,020 cakes, which retail for about $90 each. The wildest part of this story: Lliviganay is accused of wanting to sell the cakes on the black market. I’ll just stick with my Betty Crocker boxed cake, please. [The Guardian]
Second year in a row
Nearly half a million more children were uninsured in 2018 than in 2017. Data released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau shows a rise in the number of children without health insurance for the second year in a row. The increase was most stark among kids in the south, rising from 6.5 percent to 7.7 percent. One cause of the trend is a drop in the number of children covered by public services, such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. [NPR]
iPhone 11
Apple is back with another iPhone, and you can get a basic model for the low, low price of $700. Yes, apparently for Apple this is indeed a deal. Last year’s comparable model started at $750. The more advanced iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be $1,000 and $1,100, respectively. These new additions are said to have enhanced photo capability, with the entry-level phone having a dual-lens camera and the Pro models including a triple lens. I’m clueless as to what those features actually do, but I’m sure they’re magical. [The New York Times]
Zero interest rates
President Trump is criticizing the Federal Reserve again. In a tweet Wednesday, the president called for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to “ZERO, or less.” Trump went on to criticize the “naïveté” of Fed chair Jerome Powell, and called Fed leaders “boneheads.” Powell has already cut interest rates to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, but many say even lower rates are needed to avoid a recession. However, the push for subzero interest rates seems to counter the White House’s message of economic optimism. [CNN]

Last week, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record made a direct hit on the northern Bahamas and stalled there, destroying nearly half the homes on Great Abaco and Grand Bahamas islands. Days later, with their homes in ruins and food and water scarce, hundreds of fleeing Bahamians were asked to leave a ferry bound for Fort Lauderdale, Fla., because they didn’t have a U.S. visa — despite visas not being required in the past. And while U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials blamed the ferry operator, the federal government announced Wednesday it wouldn’t be extending the Dorian survivors temporary protected status.
Rising sea levels, wildfires, drought or a slow-moving hurricane can all threaten your way of life as surely as a bomb. But unlike victims of war for whom the causes and effects of the threats are clear and codified, there are no protections for environmental migrants. That’s despite World Bank estimates that tens of millions of people could be climate refugees by 2050, research showing asylum seeking already increases in response to climate-related issues like rising temperatures, and the fact that researchers have been talking about the plight of people who must escape not-entirely-natural disasters since at least 1988. Technically, in the context of legal and political systems, climate refugees don’t exist. There’s no space for them in international law and no special plans for how to treat them in the United States when they arrive. Here and around the world, fleeing climate change means running to bureaucracies as inhospitable to your survival as the places you left behind.
Just ask Ioane Teitiota, a man from the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati who applied for asylum in New Zealand in 2010 on the basis that rising sea levels were slowly swallowing the land under his feet. His claim was denied because he didn’t fit existing definitions of what a refugee can be. Same with the other Pacific Islanders who have been seeking status as environmental migrants in Australia and New Zealand since at least 2000. The problem for Teitiota and others wasn’t that immigration officials didn’t believe climate change was happening. If only it were that simple and easy to judge. Instead, the rulings centered on the fact that systems designed in the 1950s simply aren’t accommodating the needs of the modern world.
Life-threatening climate change crises are almost never just one thing. In Teitiota’s case, New Zealand’s Immigration and Protection Tribunal pointed out (correctly) that climate change was stacked on top of other problems on Kiribati — too much population growth, not enough sanitation infrastructure and greater numbers of people packing into urban areas. Sure, Teitota’s house was increasingly threatened by high tides, but other parts of the island were still safe. And, anyway, the Tribunal argued, refugee status in New Zealand is dependent on both the prospect of long-term human rights violations and a failure of the migrant’s own state to act. If climate change exacerbates a downward spiral in Kiribatians’ standard of living while developed nations that produce far more of the world’s greenhouse gases do nothing — well, there’s no legal precedent to call that a problem big enough for them to run from.
Climate change is real. But it’s also messy and complicated. In a climate change era, a hurricane can behave in a way that matches scientists’ predictions of how extreme weather is likely to evolve on a hotter planet. But we can’t say with absolute certainty that it was climate change — and climate change alone — that destroyed those Bahamian homes. In a climate change era, government policy (or lack thereof) can be directly responsible for death, destruction and impoverishment. But those don’t count as human rights violations when nature is the weapon.
And just as the complexity of climate systems can be used to sow doubt about the ways humans can alter them, complexity also can provide a convenient excuse for ignoring the victims of those changes. We can’t be sure who counts as an environmental migrant and who doesn’t. The paperwork isn’t right. They just don’t fit the established pathways.
To be fair, including environmental migrants would represent a radical shift in the way we think about migration. The original United Nations compact on refugees — the first international agreement to help displaced people — was signed in 1951 and basically only protected Europeans who had been made homeless or stateless by the second World War. Later agreements stripped away the limitations of geography and time, but not enough to encompass the effects of a slow-motion global disaster. Expanding migrant and refugee protections that far could potentially allow millions of new asylum claims. Low-immigration advocacy groups consider it incompatible with U.S. sovereignty.
So climate change migrants are stuck in a legal and political gray zone. Our systems aren’t designed for them. Changing those systems would be complicated, inconvenient and expensive. Efforts to create frameworks to take them into account run into opposition — such as the U.N. compact on migration that was signed last December, which was rejected by the U.S. and other countries most responsible for the changing climate. If this all sounds a bit like what got us into this climate problem to begin with, well, yes, it is.
There’s not necessarily a clear answer to what we should do about climate migrants. Again, it’s complicated. But what is clear is that ignoring the problem doesn’t make it go away. If rising temperatures and volatile weather have taught us anything, it’s that threats don’t vanish just because you refuse to make eye contact. When the U.S. denies Bahamian survivors of Hurricane Dorian protected status, we’re participating in another international failure to protect the people most harmed by climate change.

For the next month, that meant a last-minute pitch to one of the country’s top quarterback prospects, Sam Howell, who reopened his recruitment after committing to Florida State.
“We had a sit down with him to talk about our philosophy, who we were and where we were going,” Brown told reporters last December. “He felt like that fit him perfectly.” And so Brown already had a big win: Howell signed with North Carolina. Last month, Brown did what many quarterback-needy coaches are doing these days: He tied the fate of his season to a true freshman.
It has paid off so far. Howell delivered a terrific debut against South Carolina in Charlotte, completing 15 of 24 passes for 245 yards and leading two 90-plus yard touchdown drives to win the game in the second half. Last week against Miami, he followed that performance with an almost-identical stat line (16-for-24, 274 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions), and now North Carolina is 2-0 and buzzing.
Howell is not alone. Freshman starting quarterbacks were the story of college football’s opening week, as the top three dual-threat quarterback prospects in 247sports.com’s 2019 recruiting rankings — Auburn’s Bo Nix, Arizona State’s Jayden Daniels and Howell — all won starting jobs at Power Five schools and all won their first two games.
Nix — entrusted with the starting job by a coach on the hot seat, Gus Malzahn — made arguably the play of Week 1, a go-ahead, 26-yard touchdown pass that put Auburn ahead of Oregon with nine seconds left. Daniels produced three touchdowns in Arizona State’s season-opening rout of Kent State.1
Two more true freshmen entered the fold at Power Five schools last weekend, as Southern California’s Kedon Slovis took over for JT Daniels, who’s out for the season with an ACL injury, and South Carolina’s Ryan Hilinski replaced Jake Bentley, who’s out of the season with a foot injury. Slovis was outstanding, with 377 yards and three touchdowns on 28-for-33 passing. Hilinski and South Carolina beat Charleston Southern easily. 2
Why the push for so many newcomers? For starters, today’s freshmen don’t play like freshmen. “These guys, they don’t treat me like a freshman,” Daniels told reporters after his debut. “They treat me like a veteran.” Nix, Malzahn has said, is “not your normal freshman.” North Carolina offensive lineman Nick Polino, too, said Howell “is not hesitant like most freshmen.” Perhaps that’s a product of the personal quarterback coaches employed by so many young players. Or maybe it’s because Howell, Nix and Daniels enrolled early, entering the quarterback competition last winter rather than this summer.
With young players, and quarterbacks especially, coaches have tempered expectations for as long as they have worn whistles. After Edwards named Daniels the starter, he told reporters, “He’s not the savior, OK? I don’t want anyone to think that. He’s a freshman quarterback. He’s going to do a lot of good things and sometimes he’s going to make some errors.” And since coaches face criticism no matter whom they put under center, they often turn to new players when they need a spark. With a young talent, they can build around him and claim progress in the right direction.
Maybe some, after last season, are following the example Clemson set. Already in possession of a quarterback who led them to the previous season’s College Football Playoff, Dabo Swinney’s Tigers introduced Trevor Lawrence to game action in the first four weeks and then made him the starter in the fifth, unseating Kelly Bryant. Lawrence finished undefeated and became the first freshman quarterback to win a national championship since Oklahoma’s Jamelle Holieway did it in the 1985 season. Now he’s one of the favorites to win the Heisman Trophy, and Clemson is assured two more years with him on campus.
Historically speaking, today’s freshman quarterbacks are treading into fairly uncertain territory. Since at least 2009, no SEC freshman has started at quarterback in the season opener and gone on to qualify for year-end stats.3 In the ACC, there were four: Louisville’s Lamar Jackson, Miami’s Brad Kaaya, Wake Forest’s John Wolford and Boston College’s Dave Shinskie.4 Others have gone on to have breakout freshman seasons, of course, but not even Alabama’s Jalen Hurts or Georgia’s Jake Fromm started the season opener.
Howell’s early consistency is rare: In the past 20 seasons, just three other quarterbacks in any class have put up the same, gaudy stat line (at least 60 percent completions, more than 240 yards, multiple touchdowns, no interceptions) against a Power Five team in each of the first two games.5 Surely there will be bumps ahead for him, Nix and Daniels. But their schools, who finished a combined 17-20 last season, can hope for better days ahead.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/home-runs-are-soaring-could-declining-backspin-be-a-factor/,2019-09-12,,,features,"Sep. 12, 2019",Home Runs Are Soaring. Could Declining Backspin Be A Factor?,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"In the seventh inning of Wednesday night’s Dodgers-Orioles game, Jonathan Villar hit a three-run blast into the left-field seats in Camden Yards. When he crossed home plate, there was a new Major League Baseball record for home runs in a season: It was the 6,106th of 2019, breaking the record set two years ago. The usual suspects are widely cited for this year’s power surge: The balls are livelier, with even commissioner Rob Manfred admitting that there’s less drag, and average launch angle is up to a Statcast-era high of 12 degrees as more hitters join the “Fly-Ball Revolution.” Strikeout rates suggest batters might be employing more all-or-nothing approaches, and fastballs are being thrown higher in the zone, making them easier to elevate. And there’s another characteristic of the home run record: Batters may be making a higher quality of contact, as it relates to the spin rate of batted balls.
The spin rate of the baseball has been a focus of late, but primarily in regard to pitching. New ball-tracking technology allows pitchers to measure their spin rates and spin axis to create better pitch movement. But it turns out that spin rate matters for hitters, too — a little less of it might help.
Backspin often works in favor of the hitter, as it creates a Magnus effect, which pushes up on the baseball to create lift. But there can also be too much of a rise effect. When studying golf balls, researchers have found that when too much spin is added at certain launch angles, there is a “ballooning” effect. For baseball hitters, that means that excessive spin might lead to batted balls traveling higher, but not farther.
Alan Nathan, physics professor emeritus at the University of Illinois and MLB consultant, says there are optimum spin levels in baseball for batters. “Not only does the lift increase with the spin, but it’s really only been in the last few years that we’ve realized that the air drag also increases with the spin,” Nathan told FiveThirtyEight. “So that slows the ball down.”
Exit velocity off the bat is at a record level this season since Statcast began ball-tracking in 2015, but this year spin rate has actually declined, according to Statcast data analyzed by FiveThirtyEight.1 On line drives and fly balls hit at between 15 and 39 degrees of launch angle, backspin has declined for two consecutive seasons and by 2.3 percent since 2017.

There are different types of spin: topspin, which usually produces ground balls; backspin, typically accompanying balls hit in the air; side spin, which ends in balls that hook or slices; or a mix of sidespin and either backspin or topspin. Spin rates on batted balls with a blend of back and side spin are also down this season. Generally, the greater the launch angle, the greater the backspin, in revolutions per minute. But there are diminishing returns when it comes to backspin.
“Certainly by 2,500 rpm it starts to level off, meaning with additional spin you don’t get any increase in distance [as a hitter],” Nathan said. “Then if you go even higher, maybe above 3,000 or 3,500 rpm, that’s the [range] where distance actually starts to decrease with spin as the drag starts to overwhelm the good benefits that you get with the additional lift.”
Players are starting to pay attention. Seattle Mariners outfielder Mitch Haniger, who says he’s always been interested in new ideas and information, had his batted-ball spin rates measured last winter to better understand his own underlying performance.
“I think the way the ball is spinning off your bat can tell you a lot about how your barrel is working through the zone,” Haniger told FiveThirtyEight in May, before injuries derailed his season. “I think everyone is convinced that hitting a line drive is a good result. I think certain hitters have to hit more on top, others more underneath [the ball]. It depends on what swing characteristics you have.”
Cody Bellinger, among the MLB leaders in wins above replacement, is also hitting the ball with less spin this year after retooling his swing in the offseason. In 2018, on batted balls with launch angles of 15 to 40 degrees,2 Bellinger averaged 93.9 mph in exit velocity and a projected distance traveled of 326.8 feet, all with 2,992 rpm in spin rate. This season, entering August, Bellinger had increased his average exit velocity on those balls in the air to 95.4 mph and his overall distance to 336.2 feet. His spin rate had decreased to 2,550 rpm. He has hit fewer pop-ups and ground balls and owns a career-high rate of line drives in his best season to date.
Nathan says drag reduction from lowered spin rates is likely small, but that factor combined with added exit velocity could speak to more and more hitters making better contact via more optimized swings — and adding distance at certain launch angles. Since 2017, the batted balls with the most average distance, as projected by Statcast tracking, are those hit with a launch angle of between 25 and 30 degrees and with backspin. Balls hit in that launch range this year are traveling slightly over a foot further than that of the same launch range in 2017, with an exit velocity 0.33 mph greater and a spin rate of over 100 rpm less, on average. And no — spin rates wouldn’t be affected by any changes to the ball, Nathan said.
“If you want to have a high exit velocity, you want to have a squared up ball-bat collision, which means the bat is moving right through the center of the ball, you are hitting the ball more squarely. That would lead to lower spin,” Nathan said. “The kind of contact that will give you the highest exit velocity will give you lower spin. It could be that batters are simply squaring up better.”

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-it-really-a-three-candidate-race/,2019-09-11,,,features,"Sep. 9, 2019",Is It Really A Three-Candidate Race?,Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"A much-discussed poll last month showing an effective three-way tie between Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders at the top of the Democratic primary field has since proven to be something of an outlier. But the narrative that the Democratic primary has collapsed down into a three-way race between Biden, Warren and Sanders is still going strong.
Now that we’re past the Labor Day holiday — traditionally a time when the pressure increases on lesser-running candidates to either improve their performance or to drop out — is the “three-way race” the right way characterize the primary? On ABC News’s This Week on Sunday, I gave a quick answer to this question.1 (p.s. Our “Do You Buy It?” segment on This Week, usually featuring yours truly, is airing almost every Sunday now, so we hope you’ll tune in!) But this is fairly challenging question, so let me give a longer answer here.
The question is challenging because it really involves two distinct components:
Are candidates who are polling in the low single digits — there are a lot of these candidates! — in deep trouble? Or do they have plenty of time to come back?
Among those candidates with more of a pulse in the polls, do Biden, Sanders and Warren form a clear top tier?
Let’s take these one at a time — today, we’ll try to define that top tier, and tomorrow we’ll explore whether any of the bottom-dwelling candidates have much of a prayer.
Defining the top tier is a challenge. To develop some very crude priors, let’s turn to my colleague Geoffrey Skelley’s research on the predictive accuracy of early primary polls, which included a chart showing how a candidate’s standing in national polls translates to his or her chances of winning the nomination:2
Depending on which polling average you look at, Biden’s currently polling at 28 to 30 percent, Warren’s at 18 to 19 percent, Sanders is perhaps just a hair below her at 15 to 18 percent, and Harris is at 7 or 8 percent. All of them would count as “well-known” candidates by our definition,3 although Harris is somewhat less well-known than the others. They’re followed in the polls by two candidates who aren’t as well-known: Pete Buttigieg at 4 or 5 percent, and Andrew Yang at about 3 percent. Historically, these less-well-known candidates have a lot more room to grow from single-digit polling.
If you look up each candidate in the chart, you’d come up with roughly the following for the odds of their winning the nomination. To be extra clear, this is just a simple calculation based only on national polls, not a FiveThirtyEight forecast. For a fun comparison, I’ll also show each candidate’s probability of winning the primary according to the betting market Betfair as of early Sunday evening:

All right, there’s lots to unpack here. For one thing, based on national polls alone, Biden is still really in a tier by himself. It’s not just that polling at 28 or 30 percent is quite a bit higher than 17 or 18 percent. It’s also that the difference between Biden’s polling and the candidates below him falls within a range that, empirically, has been something of an inflection point as to who eventually wins the nomination or not. Candidates who are sitting in the mid-to-high teens — such as Warren and Sanders — don’t have a fantastic track record. A candidate in Biden’s position will still lose more often than not, but they have a considerably better record of success historically.
Of course, there’s no reason you should limit yourself to looking only at national polls. If you were building a predictive model at this stage, it would probably consist of some sort of amalgam of national polling adjusted for name recognition, early-state polling and endorsements, which are historically fairly predictive of nomination outcomes. In Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden looks weaker and Warren and Sanders (and to some extent Buttigieg) look a lot more viable. But endorsements are another story, and those don’t look especially good for Warren and Sanders. Instead, Biden and Harris are well out in front in endorsements, although many potential endorsers are sitting on the sidelines.
The prediction markets deviate a lot from the objective data in the cases of Warren and Biden. They actually had her as being more likely to win the nomination than him (as of Sunday evening), even though he’s ahead in national polls and endorsements, and at worst tied with her in Iowa and New Hampshire (and way ahead in South Carolina). That isn’t necessarily wrong; it’s an early enough stage of the primary that I’d say there’s some room for subjectivity. But there are also some reasons to be cautious. The conventional wisdom has repeatedly expected Biden to implode when it hasn’t really happened yet. And frankly, the people trading in these markets — mostly younger and well-educated — aren’t your prototypical Biden voters.
And none of this makes it any easier to divide the candidates into tiers. For me, at least, the lines between the top several candidates are blurry. I’m pretty sure that I still like Biden’s chances better than Warren — as I said, that’s certainly where a statistical model would come out. But I wouldn’t wager a huge amount of money on that proposition. I think Warren has a few things going for her that Sanders doesn’t — less voter concern about her age, more room to make peace with the establishment and slightly better polling. But you could argue that they should basically be treated as tied.
I’m also not quite sure what to do with Harris. A “Party Decides” rubric that heavily emphasizes endorsements and the ability to build a broad coalition would treat her as one of the favorites, while the polling wouldn’t. Then again, she’s had moments where she was polling better, and she could be poised to benefit if Biden falters among black voters or Warren does among college-educated ones. One reason to be pessimistic about the chances of candidates such as Cory Booker and Beto O’Rourke, in fact, is that if something did happen to one of the frontrunners, Harris would probably be first in line to benefit from that.
Overall, the best I can do is something like this:
Nate’s not-to-be-taken-too-seriously presidential tiers
For the Democratic nomination, as revised on Sept. 9, 2019

a
Biden

b
Warren

c
Sanders

d
Harris

Buttigieg
3

Yang, O’Rourke, Booker, Klobuchar, Castro

Everyone else
Even if you do have Biden, Warren and Sanders as your top three candidates (as I do), there’s no particular reason to draw a firm line at three candidates as opposed to some other number. If you’re just looking at national polls, then Biden’s still in a tier by himself. Prediction markets basically have it as a two-horse race between Warren and Biden. You can add Sanders to make it a top three… but factor in endorsements, and Harris probably also needs to join the group, which would leave us with four candidates. I don’t really put a lot of emphasis on money raised, as it hasn’t been a very predictive indicator historically, but if you did, you could add Buttigieg to the top tier and make it a top five.
Perhaps this week’s debate will provide more clarity. If Warren has another strong debate and continues gaining in the polls, for instance, we might have a relatively clear two-way race between her and Biden. But the reality will probably be a lot messier.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-youre-polling-in-the-low-single-digits-youre-probably-toast/,2019-09-11,,,features,"Sep. 10, 2019","If You’re Polling In The Low Single Digits, You’re Probably Toast",Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Yesterday, I wrote about the middle and upper echelons of the Democratic field: those candidates who are polling in the mid-single-digits or higher. You can certainly posit a rough order of which of these candidates are more likely to win the nomination. I’d much rather wager a few shekels on Joe Biden than Pete Buttigieg, for instance. But I don’t think there’s any hard-and-fast distinction between the top tier and the next-runners-up.
For candidates outside of that group — those polling in the low single digits, or worse — I have less-welcome news. I don’t really care which order you place them in, because unless they turn it around soon, they’re probably toast.
In this article, I’m mostly referring to Cory Booker, Beto O’Rourke, Julián Castro and Amy Klobuchar, who I’ll refer to as the BOCK candidates (Booker/O’Rourke/Castro/Klobuchar) for short. Some of this also applies to candidates (e.g. Michael Bennet) who didn’t make this week’s debate at all, although they’re in even worse shape. I’m not counting Andrew Yang as part of this group, however. He’s actually polling slightly better than the BOCKs, despite lower name recognition, and is more of a sui generis case.
Subjectively speaking, the BOCK group is a reasonably interesting and well-qualified set of candidates. At times, I’ve thought various members of this group were poised for a breakout. (I also thought some of them, such as Klobuchar, would come out of the gate stronger when they initially launched their campaigns.) If you fast-forwarded to next July and one of these candidates — Booker, say — was accepting the Democratic nomination in Milwaukee, it wouldn’t be that surprising on some level. They have the sort of profile that resembles those of past presidential nominees.
But the BOCK candidates don’t have the polling of those past nominees. And empirically, that’s a pretty enormous problem for them. As my colleague Geoffrey Skelley discovered in his series on the predictive accuracy of early primary polls, only one candidate in the modern primary era has come back from averaging less than 5 percent in national polls in the second half of the year before the primary to win the nomination. That was Jimmy Carter, who did so in 1976. Given the number of candidates who failed to make it, that would make their chances of winning the nomination very low — somewhere on the order of 1 or 2 percent.
Now, you might look at someone like a Booker or a Klobuchar and assume that they’re better qualified than the candidates who were polling in the low single digits in past nomination races. But that’s not necessarily true. Sure, those races included plenty of Alan Keyeses and Dennis Kuciniches, but there were also plenty of other senators and governors who were highly plausible nominees but whose campaigns just never really gained traction.
Of course, there are a few caveats and qualifications. Geoffrey’s research covers polling across the entire second half of the pre-election year — that is, from July through December. If Booker or Klobuchar began surging in the polls now, they could finish above that 5 percent threshold over the six-month period. Also, these candidates are running full-fledged campaigns, whereas some of the low-polling names from past nomination cycles spent a lot more time flirting with whether to run or not.1 Meanwhile, Booker and Klobuchar (more so than O’Rourke or Castro) have decent numbers of endorsements, which are historically a fairly predictive indicator, although most of those endorsements are from their home states.
So, if you want to go to the mat and argue that Booker or one of the other BOCK candidates has, I don’t know, a 5 percent chance of winning the nomination, I’m not really going to argue with you. (And collectively, they have a better chance than they do individually, of course. Keep that in mind if you’re hate-reading this column a year from now because O’Rourke won the nomination or something.)
But a lot of this smacks of special pleading, and ignores that the empirical evidence is fairly robust in this case: Lots of candidates have hoped to come back from polling in the low single digits to win their nominations, and almost none of them have done it. A somewhat larger group have emerged as factors in races that they ultimately didn’t win — Rick Santorum in 2012, for example — but elections aren’t something where close really counts. Nor are any of these candidates polling especially well in Iowa or New Hampshire, which is the path that dark-horse candidates (such as Carter or Santorum) usually take to enter the top tier.
It’s also pretty hard to know what type of event might trigger a sudden surge in support for one of the BOCKs. Castro and Booker had strong nights in the first and second debates, respectively, and it barely moved the numbers for them. O’Rourke saw a spike in media attention following the mass shooting in his home town of El Paso, Texas, and his support in polls didn’t move much after that, either.
Moreover, Democrats are fairly satisfied with their field, and they’re paying a relatively large amount of attention to the campaign as compared with similar stages in past nomination races. That’s also a bearish indicator for the BOCKs. Democrats aren’t necessarily shopping around for fresh alternatives, in the way that Republicans were in 2011 and 2012, when Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain and others surged and declined in the polls.
That may be because the top three to five candidates do a relatively good job of covering the various corners of the Democratic primary. College-educated voters tend to like Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Buttigieg; non-college voters have Biden and Bernie Sanders. Older voters tend to like Biden, whereas Sanders’s and Warren’s supporters are younger. Moderates have Biden, while liberals have lots of alternatives. Biden is well-liked among black voters, and if they sour on him, there’s Harris. Hispanic voters don’t have an obvious first choice, and maybe there’s a niche for a moderate candidate who isn’t Biden for voters who think Biden is too old. But overall, the Democratic electorate is pretty well picked over.
Put another way, if you’re wondering why candidates such as Castro and Booker aren’t gaining more traction despite seemingly having run competent campaigns, the answer may have less to do with them and more to do with the fact that the field has a lot of heavyweights. Biden is a former two-term vice president; Sanders was the runner-up last time and basically built an entire political movement, and Warren and Harris have been regarded as potential frontrunners since virtually the moment that Donald Trump won the White House. The years that produce volatile, topsy-turvy nomination races, such as the 1992 Democratic primary, tend to be those where a lot of top candidates sit out, perhaps because they’re fearful of running against an incumbent with high approval ratings. Trump looks beatable, however, and almost all of the highly plausible Democratic nominees, save Sherrod Brown, ran. There isn’t much oxygen for those at the top of the field, let alone for the candidates a few rungs down.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Michael Bloomberg is taking the e-cigarette craze very seriously. Bloomberg Philanthropies announced Tuesday it will push state and federal lawmakers to ban flavored e-cigarettes; the group plans to spend $160 million over three years in this effort.

A 9-year-old had his cheese sticks snatched away (on his birthday). Why, you ask? Because he had an unpaid school lunch balance of … $9.75. Jefferson Sharpnack, a student with Green Primary School in Ohio, said he was “a little hurt” after his hot lunch was taken last week. The incident caused a public uproar and the school district changed its policy. According to the superintendent, students will now “receive the standard lunch for the day at their respective buildings regardless of their account balance.” Happy belated, little Jefferson!

California college athletes looking to make some coins from their hard work could be in luck. The State Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bill Monday that will allow college athletes to more easily make money off their name, image and likeness. Once some details are ironed out between California’s legislatures, the bill will head to Gov. Gavin Newsom, and, if signed, would take effect Jan. 1, 2023. The new measure could set up a conflict with the NCAA’s amateurism rules that restrict compensation for athletes. Stay tuned. [USA Today]
A $120,000 deposit
Note to self: If you get a mysterious bank deposit, don’t spend it! A Pennsylvania couple is in legal trouble after blowing through the majority of $120,000 mistakenly deposited into their bank account. Among their many purchases, the couple apparently bought a Chevrolet SUV, a race car and two four-wheelers. In total they spent just over $107,000. Now, they’re facing felony theft charges. The price of their SUV: $14,500. Peace of mind: priceless. [Fox Business]
Less than one-third
The Trump administration has some spending to do. Tens of billions of dollars allocated for disaster recovery haven’t been used yet. As of June 30, the government had spent less than one-third of the $107 billion provided by Congress. The funds are being held up in part by antiquated laws, in addition to the federal requirements states and cities must meet to receive money. The slow spending is one of several big challenges for federal officials as disasters worsen amid climate change. [The New York Times]

A Special Democratic Debate Edition",A FiveThirtyEight Chat,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s weekly politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Welcome, everyone, to a special debate-focused preview edition of our weekly politics chat!! In recent weeks, we’ve talked a lot about the different strategies the candidates should use on the debate stage, who the lineup is good for (and who it’s bad for) and whether the field might be consolidating around a handful of candidates.
So today, let’s have a little fun with the question of candidate debate strategy and play a game of buy/sell/hold with PredictIt prop bets (plus some I made up). We checked the prices (given in cents) of a bunch of propositions at noon Eastern on Tuesday and then translated those prices into probabilities. (We know that’s not exactly right, but it’s close enough.)
And in case you forgot how to play buy/sell/hold:
Buy means: “I think the chances of this happening are higher than indicated.”
Sell means: “I think they’re lower.”
Hold means: “I’m a coward and am unwilling to take a stand.”
OK, let’s start with a 🌶 spicy 🌶 proposition. Buy, sell or hold: Elizabeth Warren will win the 2020 presidential Democratic nomination? (33 percent)
nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): I am bullish on Warren overall, but I still think it’s a pretty open race. I’ll sell on Warren — I think her chances are a bit lower than 33 percent.
clare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): I’ll buy! If only for the argument. I think that Warren is a secure bet in this race and that she’s the only candidate who’s seen steady, significant gains. That’s gotta count for something.
I also think that she’ll pick up establishment-leaning voters as the race goes on and other people drop out — or at the very least, she’s one of a few arms that establishment-leaning types will want to fall into.
natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): I’m boarding a plane, so my answers will be brief at best. Warren’s somewhere between a hold and a sell. And 33 percent is a lot, given where her position in the polls is. That price puts a lot of weight on subjective vs. objective impressions, in other words. I happen to share those subjective impressions, i.e. my “gut” says Warren is a very strong candidate. However, I’ve been doing this long enough to know that my gut is usually full of shit.
clare.malone: NATE’S ON A PLANE 🐍
geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, elections analyst): If Biden’s chances are, say, 40 percent based on his standing in polls from the first half of the year, that leaves like 60 percent for everyone else. Does Warren have a bit more than half of that? I’m skeptical of that so I’ll sell — for now.
ameliatd (Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, senior writer): I think I’m somewhere between a buy and a hold? (Outing myself immediately as a quasi-coward.)
clare.malone: Lol, it’s fine Amelia — I’m a little less wedded to the strict odds of this. I’m more going on the gut that Nate speaks of and strength on the ground, etc.
ameliatd: Warren’s growth has been impressive. And she stands to gain as the field narrows. It seems like she might be starting to overcome some voters’ worries about nominating a woman, too? Which would be big, if so.
natesilver: I mean Biden is way too low in these markets, so if you’re saying Warren has a 33 percent chance or higher, you’re saying it’s basically a two-horse race. Which, maybe?
clare.malone: I don’t think that’s crazy, Nate.
Not a lot of people are super bullish on Sanders right now.
And Harris is slipping in the polls.
So … it’s not totally nuts to go with the idea that it COULD potentially be a Biden-Warren showdown.
sarahf: Bernie is in third at 14 percent, but that’s a distant third behind Warren (33 percent) and Biden (26 percent) over at PredictIt.
natesilver: If Warren got into the low 20s in national polls instead of the high teens, I might feel more comfy with that. That tends to be a big inflection point. Being in the 20s in a multi-way race is serious business.
nrakich: Harris still has a lot of untapped potential, IMO.
ameliatd: I don’t know, Nathaniel. My “buy” sentiments for Warren are probably contingent on Harris not pulling it together. But based on how her summer went, that seems increasingly plausible. Like, at some point your untapped potential needs to start turning into actual gains.
geoffrey.skelley: I know I said I sell on Warren, but I can certainly see her winning heavily-white Iowa and New Hampshire, building up — Nate’s favorite word — “momentum” and going on to win the nomination.
And that’s the tough thing about this — the sequential nature of the primary means we can look at the national polls and early-state polls, but the moment Iowa happens, that will influence what happens in New Hampshire, and so on.
sarahf: Speaking of Iowa and New Hampshire … Warren has a 35 percent chance in Iowa and a 34 percent chance in New Hampshire … does that change anyone’s wager? The markets do give Biden a 48 percent chance in South Carolina, though, and Warren only a 14 percent shot.
nrakich: I think that 35 percent in Iowa is considerably closer to reality. I think her odds of winning Iowa are higher than her odds of winning the nomination writ large.
She has an excellent ground game, which could help her in a low-turnout, activist-driven caucus state like Iowa.
And she has performed better in Iowa polls than national ones so far.
geoffrey.skelley: There are 26 days between Iowa and South Carolina and 18 days between New Hampshire and South Carolina. That’s A LOT of time for the “Biden’s a loser” theme to permeate things if he can’t win either Iowa or New Hampshire. Nevada, as it’s worth reiterating, is BEFORE South Carolina, which could maybe help him. But the Silver State is a bit of a black box.
natesilver: I’d buy on Warren in IA/NH. There should be more of a spread in these markets between her Iowa price and her nomination price. The fact that there isn’t proves these markets are kinda dumb.
ameliatd: That underscores my very definitive wager of “somewhere between a hold and a buy.” She’s doing well in Iowa and New Hampshire — which is why I would say her chances are better than you might think if you just look at the national polls.
clare.malone: Warren is going to have an easier time in those very white first two states — Biden, for a number of reasons, enjoys an advantage with black voters in South Carolina, which is pretty much how you win that state.
But Warren’s campaign was one of the two or three campaigns that people in South Carolina talked about as being strong in voter outreach. Even a lot of pro-Biden people there told me they liked her. So, I could see momentum or winning in IA and NH upping her odds in South Carolina and then perhaps in other southern states where black voters are key.
But that probably involves Biden faltering so she becomes more dominant — or doing something that finally sticks as a criticism.
natesilver: If you had a market for “will the Iowa winner win the nomination?” I’d probably be a seller of it.
Like, I think it would be priced at 70 percent when it should be priced at 50 or something.
The Democratic electorate used to be a lot whiter and have a lot more caucuses, so Iowa used to be a lot more representative.
But Iowa is no longer a good representation of the overall Democratic electorate right now.
geoffrey.skelley: Oh definitely, but if Warren wins Iowa and New Hampshire, I bet she’ll be polling better in Nevada and South Carolina than she is right now.
Also, keep in mind, Bill Clinton is the only recent nominee of a major party not to win one of the first two states, although that is complicated by the fact that no one really contested Iowa in 1992 because Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin was running.
sarahf: Interestingly though, the betting markets seem less bullish on Warren winning the presidency. Buy, sell or hold: President Trump wins the 2020 presidential election? (41 percent)
natesilver: Lol I’m not touching that question.
ameliatd: Wow, Sarah, you really went there!
clare.malone: I give a hold on that.
I truly don’t know where things stand.
There are a lot of plausible arguments to be made that Democrats come out of the nomination fight irritated at each other and unhappy with their candidate, and there’s less enthusiasm on Election Day.
nrakich: I’ll hold. Forty-one percent sounds right. Close to 50-50, as we are amid an era of close presidential elections. But every indicator right now, from his dropping approval rating to polls of the generic ballot to special elections to early general-election polls that you probably shouldn’t trust, indicates it’s a Democratic-leaning environment, so I’m willing to make a 9-point concession to that.
clare.malone: On the other hand, it could very well be a different ballgame from ’16, and people ARE really motivated to turn out against Trump, no matter who the Democratic nominee is, and the Democrats prevail against a GOP Electoral College advantage in a high-turnout election on both sides??
ameliatd: I would also say hold just because there are so many unknowns. A recent Pew poll found that most Democrats are excited by several 2020 candidates, not just their top choice, so maybe that’s good news for Democrats if it helps insulate voter enthusiasm against a potentially long and bruising primary? But I’m not sure.
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, my feelings are similar to Nathaniel’s, though you could also make the case that 41 percent is too low for an incumbent president in a closely-divided country. So I’d say hold or maybe buy.
natesilver: He’s not much of an incumbent. He barely won last time. And the track record of incumbents who barely won is not so hot.
sarahf: And as Nathaniel mentioned, his presidential approval number seems to be 📉 (his approval rating is still above 40 percent though).
geoffrey.skelley: But his approval has about as good a chance of going up again as going down in the long run — it’s been remarkably steady overall.
natesilver: That isn’t good news for Trump, though, because he probably needs his approval rating to improve for him to win reelection.
clare.malone: Nate’s not touching this, though.
natesilver: Like it’s not good news when your weight is steady if you weigh 300 pounds.
clare.malone: It could be good news if you’re 7 feet tall.
geoffrey.skelley: A BMI discussion is what we need here.
clare.malone: Clare googles “what does LeBron weigh?”
sarahf: OK … let’s pivot back to the 2020 Democratic primary. We’ve talked about where people stand on Warren’s chances of winning the nomination, and as a result where Biden or Sanders stand — but what about some of the lower polling candidates like, say, Kamala Harris? Markets put her at 10 percent. Buy, sell, hold?
ameliatd: I am not especially bullish on Harris, but that seems a little low to me. I’d say buy?
nrakich: I’m definitely buying on Harris — I think her chances are significantly higher than 10 percent.
Harris still has the potential to appeal to multiple wings of the Democratic Party — especially two very influential wings in college-educated whites and black voters. I also think her prosecutorial background means she has several good debates left in her.
geoffrey.skelley: As for Harris, I think I’d buy there just based on potential. It may be unrealized so far, but it’s still there, whether she ends up being Marco Rubio 2.0 or not.
sarahf: What about Pete Buttigieg, at 5 percent? Buy, sell, hold?
clare.malone: What the hell, sell. I do not think he has a good chance. Maybe an Iowa win? Maybe?
nrakich: I’d buy Buttigieg at 5 percent, but I think it’s a closer call than Harris.
clare.malone: I think that the markets are incredibly sensitive to the narratives of the news cycle.
So, the fact that Harris had a purportedly shitty back half of the summer, means that her odds go waaaay down — too low.
natesilver: Y’all should actually add everyone chances up because I bet you’d be at like 130 percent.
You can’t be a buy on everyone.
clare.malone: Nate, you’re not even participating fully!
Peanut Gallery!!
natesilver: The best way to participate is half-assedly.
clare.malone: Also, close read: People have sold.
sarahf: OK, so we’ve talked about some of the leading contenders for winning the nomination — Warren, Biden and Sanders. And we’ve talked about Harris, whom the markets seem a bit bearish on. But setting those candidates aside, what about the rest of the debaters? Andrew Yang is at 11 percent (insert Yang Gang joke) while everyone is at 10 percent (Harris) or lower. Would you buy any of the other candidates on Thursday night’s stage? Or sell them all?
natesilver: I’m probably the most bullish on Yang of any of the election-analyst-types, and I think that price is kind of insane and a discredit to PredictIt tbh.
geoffrey.skelley: Definitely sell on Yang at that mark. Buttigieg is harder because he, too, has potential and a lot of resources given his fundraising. But he really needs to win Iowa or finish 2nd, maybe 3rd there to be in the mix, and I’m struggling to see how that happens with the other candidates in the field — so I’ll sell him, too.
clare.malone: I’m bullish on Cory Booker, though not incredibly so (and I do remain, sadly, sensitive to Nate’s buying spree comment).
I think that Booker has the same kind of coalition-building potential — very much unrealized yet — but I think he’s probably worth being slightly-higher-valued? I think he’s investing on the ground and could have an appeal to white voters in Iowa, and if he did decently, proving his mettle there, black voters in South Carolina or Hispanic voters in Nevada might see him as more electable?
nrakich: At 2 percent, I’d be willing to buy a few of these names just because you don’t have much to lose.
I will probably get ridiculed for this, but I think Beto O’Rourke still could have something left in the tank. There’s a reason he caught fire in Texas last year — he’s a charismatic, appealing guy — and he has been holding a ton of campaign events.
ameliatd: Here’s my problem with this lower tier. A lot of these candidates have potential upside — but mainly if one or more of the higher-polling candidates stumble. That certainly seems to be the case with someone like Booker. So how much do you bake in the possibility of another candidate falling apart?
nrakich: I am also bullish on Booker, Clare, but it looks like PredictIt is too — he’s a bit higher than all the other lower-tier candidates, at 4 percent.
natesilver: If one of the front-runners stumble, wouldn’t one of the other front-runners benefit?
geoffrey.skelley: Yes, I agree with Clare and Amelia. Booker definitely could be there to pick up the pieces if Harris slides, so I’d buy at that price.
natesilver: But Harris is in 4th place now. Which pieces is he picking up?
sarahf: Yeah, I think it’s becoming increasingly harder for some of the candidates like Booker, Amy Klobuchar or O’Rourke to see any gains.
nrakich: Sarah, I think that is obviously literally true, in that every day that passes is one fewer day until the primaries. But I still think there are several months and several opportunities to stand out (e.g., debates) left.
natesilver: I’m bullish on Booker’s odds of finishing in 3rd place. I’d pay 10 percent for that.
sarahf: I keep coming back to Julián Castro, who had a strong moment in the first debate and saw a big jump in his favorability ratings and name recognition as a result, but then nothing in the polls.
ameliatd: But I’d put Castro’s chances higher than O’Rourke’s right now (if I’m choosing between the Texans). Maybe I’m wrong and O’Rourke will wow everyone in the debate … but his performances have been super snoozy so far.
clare.malone: I think Castro suffers from not being a national figure. He hasn’t had the same kind of grist as the senators have during the Trump years, and O’Rourke, his home-state rival, really crowded him out in the roll-out department.
nrakich: Yeah, I agree with Sarah that if Castro was going to make his move, he would have done it already, as he performed quite well in the first two debates.
To me, he suffers from inconsistency. He was great in the debates, but I thought he was really flat in the latest CNN town hall.
clare.malone: In the end, no one remembers who he is. The twin thing doesn’t help either …
NEVER TRUST A TWIN.
natesilver: I’d just say I have about 15 percent total to give out at most for everyone who’s not in the top 4. I’m not sure how I’d distribute that 15 percent, but it’s not a ton of wealth to go around.
nrakich: Yeah, I’m definitely splitting hairs — who cares if O’Rourke has a 5 percent chance instead of a 2 percent chance.
natesilver: FiveThirtyEight readers do!
ameliatd: Hair-splitting is what it’s all about, Nathaniel! Lean into it!
natesilver: And 20:1 vs 50:1 is a nontrivial difference
sarahf: OK, what about the candidates not on the stage? Lest we forget, Tom Steyer has made the October debate … but does that really change anything in your mind regarding who wins the nomination? My guess is maybe not … so here’s a buy/sell/hold I made up — Warren, Biden, Sanders, Harris don’t win the nomination (5 percent).
nrakich: I’d buy that, Sarah. As I said, there’s still a lot of time left, and several more debates where someone like O’Rourke or Booker or Castro could have their moment. I think Biden, Warren, Sanders and Harris are by far the most-likely nominees, but I wouldn’t be gobsmacked if it’s someone else.
clare.malone: I really don’t think anyone is going to have a moment who hasn’t already.
geoffrey.skelley: I think I would cautiously buy that. It’s obviously very likely that the nominee will be one of those four, but we’re still nearly five months out from Iowa so things could shift.
clare.malone: Call me a cynic, call me a stinker, but if you haven’t really started to prove you’ve got the potential for a coalition by mid-September … sorry, but it’s curtains.
nrakich: Clare, you’re the one who always says it’s early!
clare.malone: RIght, but now it’s September — people outside the top 4 or 5 have no shot.
And that’s the scope of this q.
natesilver: I mean I just said I think it’s a 15 percent chance on the high end. Maybe it’s more like 10 or 12. But definitely higher than 5. Five percent isn’t a lot!
nrakich: By this point in the 2012 Republican cycle, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum all had yet to have their “moment.”
sarahf: President Cain was such a good president. 😉
clare.malone: heh heh
natesilver: I don’t think this race has much to do with 2012. The frontrunners are a much more robust group than Romney alone was.
And to Sarah’s snarky comment … all those candidates lost anyway!
ameliatd: I guess the way I’d think about it is — what are the odds that some series of events manages to tank the chances of all four of those candidates? That seems quite unlikely to me.
natesilver: Yeah it’s like being five games behind but in 5th place in the MLB wild card standings. #sports
Doesn’t seem like you’re that far behind, but it’s unlikely that everyone else gets cold.
geoffrey.skelley: I think everyone wants every cycle to be like 2012 because it was exciting and messy. Also because who can forget Gingrich and Cain having a “Lincoln-Douglas” debate? But yeah, I don’t think you’re going to see a collapse of all those candidates.
ameliatd: And it’s not like if Warren suddenly starts slipping, Buttigieg or one of the lower-polling candidates will grab her supporters.
I think there’s room for movement — but mostly within that upper tier.
nrakich: Nate, you had to turn this chat into a dig at the Mets.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-won-both-elections-in-north-carolina-but-its-not-all-bad-news-for-democrats/,2019-09-11,,,features,"Sep. 10, 2019",Republicans Won Both Elections In North Carolina — But It’s Not All Bad News For Democrats,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,Special Elections,"On Tuesday, North Carolina played host to the most closely watched election since the 2018 midterms. On paper, it was Republicans who emerged victorious, going 2-for-2 in two separate congressional elections. But there was also a silver lining for Democrats — their final vote margin in the night’s marquee race was much bluer than the district’s baseline partisanship.
That race was the do-over election in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, where alleged election fraud tainted the results of the 2018 contest to such a degree that the state elections board opted to hold a new election. After the Republican candidate got just 905 more votes than the Democrat in the 2018 election, Republicans pulled off a clearer win this year: Based on unofficial results as of 11:30 p.m. on Tuesday night, Republican state senator Dan Bishop defeated Democrat Dan McCready 51 percent to 49 percent. However, Democrats did 11 points1 better in the district than we’d expect them to in a neutral political environment, as this is normally a heavily Republican district; it is 14 points redder than the nation as a whole, according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric.2 And Trump won the district by 12 points in 2016.
The results also represent a continuation of the mini-realignment we’ve seen in the Trump era of suburbs getting bluer and rural areas moving even more toward the GOP. For instance, McCready lost the district even as he won suburban Mecklenburg County by 13 percentage points, an improvement on the 2018 results, when he won Mecklenburg by 10 points. (The portion of Mecklenburg that falls in the 9th District consists of affluent white areas of metro Charlotte.) But as noted by Ryan Matsumoto, an analyst at Inside Elections, McCready did worse than his 2018 performance in every other county, most of which are sparsely populated.
On the other hand, the sleepier special election in the North Carolina 3rd Congressional District held unambiguously good news for the GOP. Republican state representative Greg Murphy defeated Democrat Allen Thomas, a former Greenville mayor, 62 percent to 38 percent. That almost exactly matches the district’s R+24 partisan lean.
Individually, the results of these races can reasonably be dismissed as the result of unique circumstances. But taken together, the results of special elections3 do mean something for 2020. Specifically, if one party is performing consistently better than its normal partisan baseline, that has historically presaged a strong cycle for that party in the next regularly scheduled election. Most recently, of course, Democratic candidates in 2017-2018 special elections did much better than a weighted average of 2016 and 2012 presidential results in their states and districts, and Democrats wound up winning control of the House amid a historic blue wave.
But 2019’s federal special elections so far have not been nearly as good for Democrats, although they have still been a bit Democratic-leaning. On average, the margins have been 3 points more Democratic-leaning than partisan lean would suggest:

Partisan lean is the average difference between how a state or district votes and how the country votes overall, with 2016 presidential election results weighted at 50 percent, 2012 presidential election results weighted at 25 percent and results from elections for the state legislature weighted at 25 percent. Note that FiveThirtyEight’s current partisan leans were calculated before the 2018 elections and so do not incorporate the midterm results.
The North Carolina 9th election was technically a do-over election but otherwise had all the characteristics of a special election.

It’s probably still too early to tell what this means, since the sample size of 2019-2020 federal special elections remains on the smaller side (until Tuesday, there had only been one all year). It could be notable for 2020, though, that the two special elections that closely matched presidential partisanship did not feature very active campaigns, while the high-profile 9th District election disproportionately activated Democratic voters.
Other indicators also suggest that the national environment has gotten slightly less blue since 2018 but still favors Democrats, though they disagree how much. As of April, Democrats were also overperforming in the average state-legislative special election (of which we have dozens of examples since 2018) by 5 percentage points, and they have had several even stronger performances recently. And our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot4 gives Democrats a 6.5-point lead; just before the 2018 election, Democrats had an 8.7-point lead, which almost exactly matched the eventual House popular vote.
Republicans can enjoy their wins tonight; with the two new Republicans taking their seats, they will have cut the Democrats’ House majority to 235-199. But early signs still point to another Democratic-leaning year in 2020 — just maybe not another “blue wave.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-dak-prescott-finally-ready-to-be-consistently-great/,2019-09-11,,,features,"Sep. 11, 2019",Is Dak Prescott Finally Ready To Be Consistently Great?,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson stole the show on the NFL’s opening Sunday with a passer rating of 158.3, the maximum number possible. But Jackson wasn’t the only QB with a perfect 158.3 mark Sunday. He was joined by Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys, who went 25 for 32 with 405 yards, four touchdowns and zero picks against the rival New York Giants. It was the first time ever that two passers had perfect games in the same week1 — and in fact, Prescott’s game may have been the superior perfect outing.
At least, that’s according to our new Elo QB ratings, which saw Prescott outperform both Jackson and Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes for the best game of Week 1, after adjusting for the opposing defenses each faced. Our model considered it to be the best game of Prescott’s entire career, easily surpassing his effort against the Ravens in Week 11 of 2016 — and there’s nothing the Cowboys would welcome more than a return to form of that (mostly) storybook season, both as a team and for Prescott individually.
Dallas had high hopes Prescott would be a fixture atop these kinds of rankings ever since 2016, when he produced one of the greatest rookie QB campaigns in NFL history en route to a 13-3 record as the starter. Thanks to that immediate success, Prescott went into 2017 with the ninth-highest Elo rating of any starting QB, and he eventually rose to No. 5 in the league by Week 9, when the Cowboys had a 5-3 record and a legitimate chance of winning the Super Bowl.2 It was the best a Dallas quarterback had rated in Elo (relative to league average) since Tony Romo in the middle of the 2013 season.
From that moment onward, however, Prescott has been all over the place. Over his following 26 starts — taking him through the end of the 2018 season — Prescott’s average game-to-game performance was about 11 points of Elo value below that of an ordinary starter, while he registered exactly 13 above-average starts against 13 below-average ones.
But we’re just scratching the surface of how up-and-down Prescott has been.
Over an eight-start period from Dec. 24, 2017, to Oct. 14, 2018, Prescott alternated between an above- and below-average QB Elo performance every single game. Then he strung together two consecutive above-average starts… before embarking on a separate stretch of nine more starts in a row in which every single game alternated between an above- and below-average performance.
It was one of the most erratic runs in pro football history. Seahawks QB Russell Wilson once had an incredible 17 consecutive starts (!) waver between positive and negative during the 2014 and 2015 seasons,3 so Prescott wasn’t quite at that level of inconsistency. But he, Cam Newton, Matthew Stafford and Matt Schaub are the only QBs in our dataset (since 1950) to have two separate streaks in their careers with at least eight consecutive starts that seesawed between above- and below-average performance every game.

Prescott finally broke the cycle late last season, stringing together four consecutive starts with positive value to close the year (including the playoffs). That’s how Prescott already had entered this season with the ninth-best Elo rating of any starting quarterback in the league, a big improvement over his No. 22 ranking going into 2018. And after Sunday’s impressive outing, he now ranks sixth — behind only Mahomes, Ben Roethlisberger, Drew Brees, Tom Brady and Matt Ryan. According to our Elo values, Prescott’s performance against New York was the fourth-best game by a Dallas starting QB (relative to league average) in Cowboys history:

The only question now is, can Prescott keep this up and put his old inconsistent ways behind him? Although our QB values are adjusted for the quality of opposing defenses, it’s still valid to wonder how much a stellar performance against the Giants — whose defense ranked last in the league according to preseason projections from ESPN’s Football Power Index — will translate against better opponents such as, say, the Vikings (who tied for ESPN’s No. 1 preseason defense) in Week 10.
But there are also reasons to think Prescott’s breakout might endure throughout the season. New offensive coordinator Kellen Moore already has added new wrinkles to the Cowboys’ scheme that were absent under Scott Linehan in previous years. Prescott also has a new(ish) set of primary targets, with Amari Cooper present from the start of the season — after averaging 80.6 yards per game upon his midseason arrival in Dallas last year — plus Michael Gallup graduating to No. 2-target status after Cole Beasley’s departure, and former Pro Bowl WR Randall Cobb coming over from the Packers. (Future Hall of Fame tight end Jason Witten is also back after a much-maligned year in the broadcast booth.)
After throwing for a below-average 7.69 air yards per attempt in 2017 and 2018, Prescott was up to 9.34 air yards per throw against the Giants, with 19 percent of his passes traveling at least 20 yards — including completions of 35 and 21 yards downfield to Cooper, 30 yards to Gallup, 22 yards to Cobb and 22 yards to tight end Blake Jarwin.
Again, those were against the Giants, so it’s important not to draw too many conclusions from Prescott’s Week 1 numbers, impressive as they were. But for a team that ranked ninth in defensive efficiency (via Football Outsiders) but only 26th in passing efficiency last season, an improvement from Prescott could vault the Cowboys to the top of the NFC East — and maybe beyond.
Looking Ahead: Week 2
Best matchup: No. 3 New Orleans at No. 5 L.A. Rams (-1.5)
Matchup quality: 97th percentile4
Matchup evenness: 76th percentile
The Rams and Saints will meet on Sunday afternoon in a rematch of that infamous NFC Championship game. Both teams won in Week 1 by slim margins, and Elo has the Saints ranked third in the NFL while the Rams are ranked fifth. A big part of that difference comes down to the quarterbacks: New Orleans’ Drew Brees ranks third in our ratings, but L.A.’s Jared Goff ranks only 26th after another subpar game (on the heels of a terrible Super Bowl and a string of mediocre outings late last season). Goff has a lot to prove, but he’ll also have a big opportunity against a Saints defense that FPI ranks just 28th in the league.

Biggest playoff implications: No. 9 Minnesota at No. 12 Green Bay (-1.5)
Potential shift in playoff odds: 30.7 total percentage points
In terms of playoff odds, the biggest game of Week 2 squares the Vikings off against the Packers. The teams have essentially identical chances to make the postseason (52 percent and 51 percent, respectively), and the winner would be set up well in the NFC North race. If Minnesota wins, their playoff odds go up to 69 percent; if Green Bay wins, their number would be 65 percent. In either case, the loser’s playoff percentage drops into the mid-30s.

Home teams are in bold.
The scoring system is nonlinear, so readers’ average points don’t necessarily match the number of points that would be given to the average reader prediction.
Readers knew better than Elo in a few notable cases — although it was all about the prognosticators’ degree of confidence in the favorite, rather than differences in opinion about who would win. (Elo was too bearish on Mahomes and the Chiefs against Jacksonville, for instance.) But Elo still won the week, beating the average reader by 7.9 points, thanks to a last-minute victory in Monday night’s Raiders-Broncos game. Perhaps because of the torrent of drama over the weekend, readers thought the Broncos would pull out the road victory; instead, Carr and the Raiders managed to win in spite of the tumult — and that was exactly the margin Elo needed.
Congratulations are in order to Joe Tito, who led all (identified) readers in Week 1 with 252.3 points. Thanks to everyone who played — and if you haven’t, be sure to get in on the action! You can make picks now and try your luck against Elo, even if you missed Week 1.

Back in 2003, the Buffalo Bills baited the football-watching world into a massive Week 1 overreaction when they walloped the rival New England Patriots, 31-0. The win came with a neat narrative — new Bills safety Lawyer Milloy was surprisingly released by the Patriots in the preseason— and seemed to signal a changing of the guard in the AFC East. But the Bills finished the season 6-10, out of the playoffs — and the Patriots won 17 of their next 18 games, including the Super Bowl.
Both participants in the biggest Week 1 blowout ever, the 1973 Atlanta Falcons’ 62-7 win over the New Orleans Saints, missed the playoffs. Meanwhile, Washington shut out Detroit 45-0 in 1991, only for the teams to meet again in the NFC Championship Game.2
So we know there’s no guarantee that the winner of a Week 1 blowout will have a better season than the loser. But how have the teams on either side of the ledger fared overall? We looked at all Week 1 blowouts — any game since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger in which the margin of victory was at least 30 points3 — to see what the Ravens and Dolphins might expect for the rest of their seasons, if history proves a guide.
Across the 46 games in question, it’s inescapable: Teams that opened their season with a statement victory had, on average, a higher regular-season winning percentage — and advanced farther in the playoffs — than the teams on the receiving end of a blowout. A total of 38 of the 46 blowout winners finished with a higher winning percentage than the losers did.

As I tabulated these averages, another trend became apparent: Week 1 blowouts have become more rare of late. There were 31 between 1970 and 1996, an average of 1.1 per season. But between 1997 and 2018, there were 15 — only 0.7 per season.
What’s more, opening-week blowouts used to be much stronger indicators of success. Before 1997, teams that delivered a Week 1 walloping won almost twice as many of their subsequent games as their victims did, and the victors went on to make the playoffs a whopping 83.9 percent of the time. Keep in mind that the wild-card round wasn’t introduced until the 1978 season, so earlier teams had a shorter road to the Super Bowl. Still, it’s impossible not to see the chasm in the postseason returns of blowout winners and losers:

The difference in win percentage is much smaller in recent years than in the older sample.4 In fact, the number of Week 1 blowouts has been so small in recent years that we run into sample size concerns; the 6.7 percent rate of Super Bowl appearances for blowout winners and losers since 1997 represents one team each.
Ideally, we would only examine blowouts that took place after the 2002 realignment, as that standardized divisions and playoff seeding across the league. That leaves us only nine data points, but the resulting gap between the winners’ win percentage (.531) and the losers’ (.438) continued to shrink.
So what happened? Why did winning a season opener by 30-plus points before 1997 give an NFL team about a 5-in-6 chance of making the playoffs, but winning teams after that have had worse than even odds? Why did the blowouts occur more frequently than once a year over that first stretch, and significantly less often since?
It’s probably a confluence of several factors, rather than any one switch being flipped. The advent of free agency in the early 1990s, a slate of player-protection rules passed a few years later and the concurrent evolution of more dynamic, three-wideout offenses all contributed to more seasonlong parity between teams despite more in-game scoring volatility.
But there are still reasons to believe that a 59-10 drubbing means something. Only a handful of modern-era teams have been blown up in Week 1, as Miami was, and gone on to have any kind of success. Even though dominating a team in Week 1 isn’t nearly as strong an indicator of success as it used to be, Baltimore is still likely in decent shape for this season. Oh, and the Ravens are all but certainly better than the Dolphins.
Then again, if any of these trends were ironclad, Milloy and the Bills would have won Super Bowl XXXVIII while Tom Brady and the Patriots watched from their couches.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-trouble-could-mark-sanford-cause-trump-in-the-2020-gop-primary/,2019-09-10,,,features,"Jul. 23, 2019",How Much Trouble Could Mark Sanford Cause Trump In 2020?,Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Republican Primary,"UPDATE (Sept. 8, 2019, 9:55 a.m.): Mark Sanford officially jumped into the 2020 Republican primary on Sunday. He joins former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh in challenging President Trump.


Mark Sanford, the former congressman and governor from South Carolina, is no stranger to criticizing President Trump. In fact, it was arguably his vocal condemnation of the president’s polarizing rhetoric and protectionist tendencies that cost him his House seat in 2018. But that hasn’t deterred Sanford from considering mounting a primary challenge against Trump. In an interview with Charleston’s Post and Courier last week, Sanford said he will take the next month to think through launching a campaign to start “pushing a national debate about America’s mounting debt, deficit and government spending.”
If he runs, Sanford could be a more attractive option to some Republicans than former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who announced his primary challenge to Trump back in April, as Sanford’s fairly conservative record is considerably more in line with the GOP. But considering that Trump has already “defeated” Sanford once before — Trump endorsed Sanford’s primary opponent in 2018 in a last-minute tweet, and Sanford lost renomination — the issue isn’t as much about whether Sanford could defeat Trump. Rather, the question is: How much trouble could he cause the president in a primary?
The South Carolinian has had a long political career, featuring two different stints in the U.S. House with two terms as governor sandwiched in between. He even weathered a memorable political scandal — he went missing for a few days in 2009 “hiking the Appalachian Trail” when he was, in fact, in Argentina carrying on an extramarital affair — to win political office again. And during his nearly two decades in office, Sanford built a reliably conservative (albeit somewhat moderate) record. According to VoteView.com, Sanford was consistently one of the more conservative members of the Republican Party during his congressional tenure. As a result, Sanford’s views may fall closer to the Republican mainstream than the socially liberal, economically moderate positions that Weld espouses.
Where Sanford is perhaps most in line with the Republican Party is with his stance on fiscal policy — reduce the deficit now — so if he were to run, this issue would be at the center of his presidential bid. On Wednesday, he even released a video in which he expressed his concerns about America’s fiscal future, arguing that people in Washington “have seemingly forgotten that debt, deficits and spending really do matter.” And Sanford’s record backs up his rhetoric. As a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Sanford slammed the Trump administration’s budgetary plans for making projections based on “a Goldilocks economy” that he viewed as unrealistically bullish. And as governor, he held the line on government spending, refusing to take money for his state from the 2009 federal stimulus package until the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled against him. In theory, Sanford’s views on fiscal policy could garner him some support in the GOP, but then again, fewer Americans now see reducing the nation’s deficit as a top priority.
One other factor that might encourage Sanford to run is South Carolina’s early position on the presidential primary calendar. The “First in the South” contest has voted third (behind Iowa and New Hampshire) in the past two Republican contests and would presumably go early once again in 2020 — if the GOP even has a primary there. South Carolina Republicans have said they might not hold a primary in 2020, but Republican Gov. Henry McMaster has said he would support GOP primary if a legitimate challenger to Trump got into the race. Nonetheless, even if Sanford ran and South Carolina held its primary, Trump is quite popular among Republicans in the state — an April poll from Winthrop University found his approval among Republicans and independents who lean Republican to be 79 percent. That might seem low — Gallup has Trump’s approval among Republicans at about 90 percent — but the inclusion of independent GOP leaners probably explains the difference.1
So even if there are some Republican voters who say they oppose Trump or are open to backing a challenger, the percentage who would be willing to support an opponent is too small to seriously threaten Trump’s renomination chances. And that’s because Trump’s approval among Republican primary voters nationally is 85 percent, according to recent data from Morning Consult. Trump is also regularly polling north of 80 percent in head-to-head matchups against Weld. So even if Sanford were a stronger challenger than Weld, it’s hard to see any path to victory — the numbers just aren’t there.

Back in February, we published a “Primary Challenge Success-O-Meter” to rate the danger posed by different types of primary challengers to an incumbent president. Given Trump’s strengths, Sanford would probably be a weak Level 2 challenger, someone who could make a little bit of a splash but never seriously threaten the president’s chances of renomination. Sanford’s goal would probably be to influence the conversation about the future of the GOP, much as Pat Buchanan did during his unsuccessful yet notable challenge to President George H.W. Bush in the 1992 Republican primary.
And arguably, Sanford sees his potential candidacy as about something besides winning. “Sometimes in life you’ve got to say what you’ve got to say, whether there’s an audience or not for that message,” Sanford said in his interview with the Post and Courier, adding, “I feel convicted.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

On Sunday, billionaire activist Tom Steyer got his fourth qualifying poll thanks to an early-state survey from Nevada, which means 11 candidates have now met the polling and donor thresholds for the Democrats’ fourth debate. And Tulsi Gabbard has announced that, based on one subset of respondents, she got a third qualifying poll this weekend, but the Democratic National Committee has confirmed that it is looking at different set of respondents and the poll will not count for her.
The fourth debate is scheduled for Oct. 15 and possibly Oct. 16 (the DNC hasn’t yet confirmed whether it will use a second debate night now that more than 10 candidates have qualified). The qualification thresholds are the same as those for the third debate: Candidates must attract both 2 percent support in four qualifying national or early-state polls released between June 28 and Oct. 1, and collect contributions from 130,000 unique donors (including at least 400 individual donors in at least 20 states).1 Given these rules, the 10 candidates who qualified for the third debate automatically made the fourth debate. And a CBS News/YouGov poll was the last survey Steyer needed to qualify.

*For candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight.
To qualify for the fourth debate, a candidate must reach 2 percent in at least four national or early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations and must have at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors in at least 20 states. Information released by campaigns is used to determine whether a candidate has hit the donor threshold. If a campaign announced it had reached 130,000 donors but did not say whether it had at least 400 donors in 20 states, we assumed that it had met the latter requirement as well. Because the DNC has confirmed their participation, we now know for sure that all the candidates in September’s debate have met the donor requirement, leaving Tom Steyer as the only candidate for whom we do not have external confirmation of that metric.
SOURCES: POLLS, MEDIA REPORTS
But while Steyer is in, Gabbard remains two polls shy despite some controversy. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released this weekend, Gabbard had 1 percent support among all adult respondents but 2 percent among registered voters. The DNC’s policy is to use a poll’s top-line number, which in this case was the support among all adults, as it appeared first in the survey. This has come up before: In a previous ABC News/Washington Post survey, the DNC likewise used the percentage among adults. The DNC confirmed to FiveThirtyEight on Sunday that the number for all adults (where Gabbard got 1 percent) would be the one that counts this time, too.
That doesn’t mean that Gabbard is going to let it go — her campaign has expressed frustration with the DNC’s polling standards in the past — and on Sunday afternoon, well after the poll’s release, Gabbard tweeted that the survey was her third poll, despite the DNC’s clarification. With less than a month to go until the deadline for qualification for the fourth debate, every poll really does count, and Gabbard is going to need all the help she can get.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

6 in 10 Americans
Amid this summer’s string of mass shootings, six in 10 Americans fear a similar tragedy could happen in their communities. The poll from ABC News and The Washington Post found that the overwhelming majority of respondents also favor some gun restrictions. Eighty-nine percent support background checks for all gun purchases, and 86 percent support “red flag” laws that permit taking guns away if a judge says an individual is dangerous. [ABC News]
30,000 open jobs
Hey Alexa: Can you find Amazon some workers? The tech company’s takeover includes the Bay Area, Chicago and Northern Virginia, but about 30,000 jobs are still unfilled across the country. The number of openings hints at the country’s strong labor market, with unemployment near a 50-year low at 3.7 percent in August. [The New York Times]
$400,000 to kill a rhino
Some of y’all need new hobbies. A Michigan trophy hunter is planning to import the body of a rare black rhino he paid $400,000 to kill in Namibia last year. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says it will issue an import permit to Chris D. Peyerk despite the U.S. Endangered Species Act restricting the import of trophies of endangered animals. There is some dispute about whether this rhino belonged to a species that is “critically endangered” or just “vulnerable.” [The Associated Press]
50 U.S. states and territories
In another headache for Google, 50 U.S. states and territories announced a broad antitrust investigation into the tech giant. Google is one of several tech companies to face accusations from public officials that they threaten competition, leading to more expensive and lower quality service for consumers. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said that Google “dominates all aspects of advertising on the Internet and searching on the Internet.” [The Washington Post]
A $340,000 watch
A few hundred thousand dollars buys a house or college tuition for most. In Odell Beckham Jr.’s case, that amount will buy a nice-ass watch. During Sunday’s game, against the Tennessee Titans, the new Browns wide receiver wore a luxury watch with a value ranging between $180,000 and $340,000. Beckham’s decision violated NFL rules, which prohibit athletes from wearing hard objects on the field. It doesn’t look like he’ll face a punishment for the violation. But if he’s willing to let that watch get damaged, maybe he could just send it my way? [CBS Sports]
At least 11 Democratic candidates
Who’s in and who’s out of the fourth Democratic presidential debate? So far, at least 11 candidates have qualified, including billionaire activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Others like Tulsi Gabbard and Marianne Williamson are struggling to get the four polls required to qualify. The fourth debate is scheduled for Oct. 15 and possibly Oct. 16. [FiveThirtyEight]

As the No. 5 through No. 8 seeds, Chicago, Seattle, Minnesota and Phoenix will face off in two single-elimination games. The reward for the winners is another single-elimination game on Sunday against No. 3 seed Los Angeles or No. 4 seed Las Vegas. In the past few seasons, this playoff format has produced several upsets, including Washington over New York in 2017 (courtesy of nine 3-pointers from Kristi Toliver) and Phoenix over Connecticut in both 2017 and 2018 (courtesy of Diana Taurasi, who sports a career 13-1 record in playoff-deciding games).
Meanwhile, atop the bracket, Washington and Connecticut secured double-byes, skipping the single-elimination games, and they now await the winners of the first two rounds for their best-of-five semifinal series.
Let’s take a look at each of the eight playoff teams, starting with the four in action Wednesday and progressing to the title favorites.
No. 8 Phoenix Mercury
15-19, 4-6 in past 10 games
The Mercury still have Taurasi, arguably the greatest WNBA player of all time, but she is recovering from back surgery and is “day-to-day for the foreseeable future,” according to High Post Hoops’ Brendon Kleen. And, unlike the previous two seasons, the Mercury will start the playoffs on the road, where they went only 6-11 this season. To make another run to the WNBA semifinals, the Mercury will likely need a big performance from 6-foot-9 All-WNBA center Brittney Griner, who is averaging 20.7 points and 7.2 rebounds per game this season while shooting 56.4 percent from the floor. Forward DeWanna Bonner, the Mercury’s other 2019 All-Star, will also need to be efficient on offense. She has carried the team at times this season and averages 17.2 points per game, but she has struggled with efficiency, shooting only 38 percent from the floor, including 27 percent on 3-pointers. An X-factor for Phoenix could be the experience of head coach Sandy Brondello, who has 17 career WNBA playoff wins and knows a thing or two about being the underdog from coaching Team Australia against the United States. Don’t be surprised if she has a trick or two up her sleeve.
No. 7 Minnesota Lynx
18-16, 6-4 in past 10 games
If you believe in the phenomenon of “odd-year teams,” Minnesota should be your bet to win it all in 2019, as the Lynx won WNBA titles in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017. But head coach Cheryl Reeve’s team wasn’t even a surefire playoff team at the start of the year, returning only three players from 2018 (a fourth, Temi Fagbenle, rejoined the team midway through the 2019 season) and adding nine through the draft, free agency and trades. Center Sylvia Fowles (13.6 PPG, 8.9 RPG), point guard Odyssey Sims (14.5 PPG, 5.4 APG) and potential WNBA Rookie of the Year forward Napheesa Collier (13.1 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 1.9 SPG) have been Minnesota’s Big Three this season, and they will likely need to play like it to get Minnesota to the semifinals. The other crucial stat for the Lynx will be turnovers, which have been their Achilles’ heel all season. They turn the ball over on 20.5 percent of their possessions, which ranks last in the league, and surrender more than 16 points per game off of those turnovers. Those numbers will almost certainly need to improve for the Lynx to advance.
No. 6 Seattle Storm
18-16, 5-5 in past 10 games
The Storm are the defending champions, but they have an entirely new look in 2019 after seasonlong injuries to stars Sue Bird and Breanna Stewart. They can struggle on offense, ranking ninth in offensive rating, but are perhaps the most exciting team in the league to watch on defense. Point guard Jordin Canada and forward Natasha Howard rank first and second in the WNBA in steals per game, which fuels the Storm’s 17.3 points per game off of turnovers, good for the third-best mark in the league. Howard also ranks third in the league in blocks with 1.7 per game, making her the first WNBA player to rank in the top three in steals and blocks per game since Yolanda Griffith in 1999. Watching Seattle is even more exciting because it usually means seeing relatively few stoppages in play; despite playing such an aggressive defense, the Storm both commit the second-fewest fouls and draw the second-fewest fouls in the league, per 100 possessions. The Storm’s road to a championship looks quite different than it did last season, when they were the No. 1 seed, but tough defense, a talented point guard and a potential First Team All-WNBA forward aren’t a bad place to start.
No. 5 Chicago Sky
20-14, 6-4 in past 10 games
Behind first-year head coach James Wade and point guard Courtney Vandersloot, the Sky surprised many onlookers by challenging for a top-4 seed. The Sky’s strength is its backcourt: Its top three scorers are starting guards Diamond DeShields, Allie Quigley and Vandersloot. Vandersloot also recently broke her own WNBA record for assists in a season — finishing with an even 300 — and averages 11.2 points, 9.1 assists and 4.3 rebounds per game. With center Jantel Lavender recently suffering a season-ending injury, Wade will have to come up with a game plan for Chicago to battle inside. One blueprint might be in the Sky’s 105-78 win over Phoenix on Sept. 1: Griner scored 26 points for Phoenix, but Chicago hit more than 50 percent of its shots, had six players score in double figures and committed only six turnovers to run away with the win.
No. 4 Las Vegas Aces
21-13, 6-4 in past 10 games
Before the season started, Las Vegas was a trendy pick to win the title behind three former No. 1 draft picks, sharpshooter Kayla McBride and 6-foot-8 center Liz Cambage. The team’s defense has been formidable, but the Aces have been inconsistent on offense, which may have cost them a chance at a double-bye. As SB Nation’s Mike Prada recently explained, they’ve actually been better when Cambage and starting forward A’ja Wilson — arguably the team’s top two players — are not on the court together. But the Aces made the playoffs for the first time since 2014, and they now have a chance to peak at the right time. Look for potential WNBA Sixth Woman of the Year Dearica Hamby (11.0 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 48.8 percent shooting) to tip a game in the Aces’ favor with her energy and versatility off the bench.
No. 3 Los Angeles Sparks
22-12, 7-3 in past 10 games
Every team this season has had to deal with players missing games, whether due to injury, the FIBA EuroBasket tournament in late June or personal reasons. For the Sparks, though, it was at a different level: The first time their entire roster was available to play was Aug. 22. So in many ways, it feels like Los Angeles’ season is just getting started. The good news is that the Sparks have three All-Star talents with championship experience in Chelsea Gray (14.5 PPG, 5.9 APG), Candace Parker (11.2 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 3.5 APG) and Nneka Ogwumike (16.1 PPG, 8.8 RPG). The bad news is that the roster is still settling in under first-year head coach Derek Fisher and, as The Athletic’s Sabreena Merchant recently detailed, the Sparks have struggled to close out games on the road. That could be a problem because the Sparks are unlikely to have home-court advantage beyond the second round. One player to watch in a potential semifinal series against Connecticut is Chiney Ogwumike, who was acquired from Connecticut shortly before the 2019 season. In three games against her former team this year, she averaged 14.7 points and 5.0 rebounds per game and shot 69 percent from the field.
No. 2 Connecticut Sun
23-11, 7-3 in past 10 games
Connecticut settled for the second seed after spending several weeks atop the league standings and finishing with a 15-2 record at home, tied with Los Angeles for best in the league. That home-court advantage bodes well for them in the semifinals, as the Sun will host the first two games and a potential Game 5. What else bodes well? They cannot draw Phoenix, their playoff nemesis of late, until the WNBA Finals (and even then, it would be a best-of-five series, not a single-elimination game).
The Sun are led by center Jonquel Jones (14.6 PPG, 9.7 RPG), forward Alyssa Thomas (11.6 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 3.1 APG) and point guard Jasmine Thomas (11.1 PPG, 5.1 RPG). Guard Courtney Williams is one of the most exciting players to watch leaguewide: She grabs 5.6 rebounds per game despite standing only 5-foot-8, she can score in bunches, and she has the swagger to match her game. Backup center Theresa Plaisance could be an X-factor; Connecticut acquired her from Dallas at the trade deadline specifically to give the team the kind of veteran forward that teams like Los Angeles (Chiney Ogwumike), Washington (Tianna Hawkins, Emma Meesseman) and Las Vegas (Hamby) have on their benches. Put all of these pieces together, and the Sun have a strong chance of making their first WNBA Finals since 2005.
No. 1 Washington Mystics
26-8, 9-1 in past 10 games
You may have heard that the Washington Mystics have a good offense. That’s true, but it’s a little like saying that UConn women’s basketball head coach Geno Auriemma, an 11-time NCAA champion, is a good coach. Led by MVP front-runner Elena Delle Donne, guard Kristi Toliver, point guard Natasha Cloud and Meesseman, Washington recorded the highest points per possession (1.128), the highest effective field-goal percentage (53.6 percent) and the most assists (746) in league history over an entire season. Delle Donne became the first player in league history to shoot 50 percent from the floor, 40 percent from 3-point range, and 90 percent from the free-throw line.1 Cloud just set a new Mystics single-season assists record, and Meesseman, Hawkins and guard Aerial Powers all have credible cases for WNBA Sixth Woman of the Year. With a double-bye to the semifinals, the Mystics get a nine-day break, which they will use both to rest their bodies and to fine-tune their play on both ends of the court. That break could be just what the doctor ordered for the Mystics to win their first-ever WNBA title.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-vikings-are-running-like-its-1972/,2019-09-10,,,features,"Sep. 10, 2019",The Vikings Are Running Like It’s 1972,Michael Salfino,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"The Minnesota Vikings said this offseason that they were going to get Kirk Cousins, their $84 million quarterback, “to that next level to do the things he does best.” Based on the game plans the team has run since overhauling its offense December — especially in Sunday’s 28-12 victory over the Falcons — the thing he does best is apparently handing the ball off to a running back.
Cousins threw only 10 passes all game, completing eight, good for 98 yards and a touchdown. That’s the fewest passes a Vikings quarterback has attempted in a regular-season win since 1977, in a game at Green Bay where the wind chill made it feel like it was minus 3 degrees. But Sunday’s game was played indoors. Since 2001, according to ESPN’s Stats & Information Group, only one winning team has attempted fewer passes while playing indoors — the visiting Carolina Panthers at the Atlanta Falcons in a 10-3 victory in 2006. The Atlanta Falcons had the next fewest passes in an indoor home win, throwing 13 times in a 34-21 victory in 2008 — Matt Ryan’s first game his rookie season.
Cousins, of course, is no rookie. He’s 31 and in his eighth season. Yet he’s being treated like a game manager by his head coach, Mike Zimmer, who fired pass-happy offensive coordinator John DeFilippo last December after DeFilippo dialed up pass plays at a rate of 67.0 percent overall and 57.3 percent in wins. DeFilippo also reportedly ignored repeated instructions from Zimmer to run more. That message was received by new offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski:1 In Minnesota’s three wins (in four games) since the firing, the Vikings have looked to throw just 37.6 percent of the time,2 including just 22.4 percent versus the Falcons this week.
This is a radical departure in today’s game. From the start of the 2018 season through Week 1 of the 2019 season, winning NFL teams pass a majority of the time: 52.6 percent, according to ESPN Stats & Info.
Don’t expect Zimmer’s Vikings to change their approach anytime soon. “I did not foresee us throwing the ball 10 times, but I’m happy we did,” Zimmer said after the game.
Cousins doesn’t seem to mind.
“Throwing 10 times is really unique,” the quarterback said. “Probably haven’t had a game with that few attempts since literally Pop Warner. I probably threw 10 times or more in most high school games, too. It was what the game called for, and I have no problem with being conservative. As long as we win the football game, that’s all that matters to me.”
The Vikings and Stefanski adopted what is ostensibly a Mike Shanahan-inspired offense, bringing in former Shanahan disciple Gary Kubiak as an assistant head coach. But in reality, Zimmer may be looking even further back for inspiration, to the NFL’s last undefeated team3 — the 1972 Dolphins. Miami that year passed only 32.3 percent of the time. But the NFL then was all about establishing the run, running to win and then running to beat the clock — the Bears that year called pass plays just 17.5 percent of the time in their wins. The leaguewide passing average in 1972 was 37.2 percent, or almost identical to what Zimmer’s squad has averaged since jettisoning DeFilippo.
This is a shocking turnaround for a team that went all in on Cousins in free agency, connecting him with a pair of elite receivers, Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs. The receivers each posted 100-catch seasons with Cousins in 2018, but they were targeted only a combined six times on Sunday. Minnesota’s relatively low number of total plays (49) and slow pace (the Vikings controlled the ball for just under half the game) certainly helped keep the number of pass attempts down, but the share of passes should still worry the receiving tandem. In the four games since the coaching change, Diggs is catching balls at a pace of 64 per 16 games, and Thielen’s pace is even lower, at just 52. That would put them on track for just 116 combined catches for the duo, while Thielen by himself caught 113 last year — 103 of them in the 13 games where DeFilippo was calling plays.
The Vikings may keep winning by making Cousins mostly a middleman in getting the ball from the center to the running back. And that would make Zimmer a hero to fans of a forgotten NFL, when teams were built to win in the trenches and defense and the running game were the stars of the show. But in 1972, most top quarterbacks made only about 10 times the league’s minimum salary. Zimmer’s Vikings are paying Cousins about 55 times the league minimum today — a lot of money to simply hand off the ball.

But the match was hardly a struggle. The Cardinal — led by the trio of seniors Kathryn Plummer (21 kills), Jenna Gray (37 assists) and Morgan Hentz (15 digs) — dispatched Florida in straight sets, 25-22, 25-17, 25-19. Four days later, the team added a win over No. 3 Texas to improve to 4-0. As a result, Stanford was the unanimous top team in Monday’s coaches poll.
The Cardinal finished 2018 with a 34-1 record, avenging its early-season loss to BYU in the national semifinals before beating Nebraska in the final. After rolling through the NCAA last season, the Cardinal return more of last year’s squad than almost any other top-ranked team.1 But the road won’t be easy for the talented favorites, who will have to beat stalwarts from the Midwest and upstarts from the South.
Stanford was the only school with three 2018 First-Team All-Americans, all of whom were juniors. The team’s biggest loss was middle blocker Tami Alade, a Second-Team All-American and the only senior who consistently played last season. Gray, the two-time defending Pac-12 Setter of the Year, was the only non-senior setter to earn First-Team All-American honors last year. Hentz, Mayor of Hentz-Ville, is the two-time defending Pac-12 Libero of the Year and last year’s Final Four Co-MVP.
And then there’s Plummer, the two-time defending National Player of the Year, a dominant force on the outside who’s already racked up more awards than can comfortably fit on her bio page. Plummer, Hentz and Gray might be the NCAA’s top players at their respective positions. The trio has won a pair of titles together and may be in line for a third.

The programs that finished last season ranked in the top 11 last year were all ranked in the top 11 in the 2019 preseason poll.
Sources: School websites, ACVA rankings
The toughest competition, as is often the case in volleyball, comes in the Big Ten, which claimed five of the top eight spots in the preseason coaches poll.
The Wisconsin Badgers may present the biggest challenger to Stanford as the only top-11 team returning a higher percentage of contributions. The preseason coaches poll put Wisconsin fifth, behind Nebraska and Minnesota, but Big Ten coaches named UW the conference favorite. The Badgers looked the part early but suffered a pair of close losses to ranked teams over the weekend and will need to bounce back.
Wisconsin is led by a junior class featuring Sydney Hilley, Dana Rettke and a redshirted Molly Haggerty. The 6-foot-8 Rettke, a nearly unstoppable blocker, spent the summer competing with the U.S. national team. Haggerty was the 2016 Big Ten Freshman of the Year, but a back injury cost her all of 2017, and she struggled to return to form last year. Hilley, a Second-Team All-American, ranked fourth in the country in assists per set last year and is one of just three setters named to an All-American team who returns this season.
And Illinois retained All-American outside hitter Jacqueline Quade from its Final Four team but lost setter Jordyn Poulter to graduation (she now plays on the national team). The Illini will likely replace her with Mica Allison — a transfer from Auburn, a former top recruit and one of the nation’s best underclassman setters. Illinois has also struggled early, losing a pair of matches this weekend, though Allison has barely played because of an injury.
And perennial contenders Nebraska and Penn State enter the season with strong young teams. Nebraska, national champions in 2015 and 2017 and last year’s runners-up, can never be counted out, especially if setter Nicklin Hames makes a substantial leap her sophomore year. The Huskers are off to a 4-0 start with no seniors on the roster. Penn State has won at least 22 matches in each of the 41 seasons played under head coach Russ Rose. The Nittany Lions, with 15 underclassmen on their roster, have jumped out to a 5-0 record but face their first big test when Stanford comes to town on Friday.
Minnesota made the biggest jump among last year’s top-10 teams, coming in third in the preseason rankings despite being upset by Oregon in last year’s regional semifinals. That loss marked the Gophers’ fourth-straight tournament upset; they were the No. 2 seed three of the last four years but haven’t reached the championship match since 2004. Replacing All-American setter Samantha Seliger-Swenson is the biggest challenge for the Gophers this year, who have struggled early this season.
Outside the Big Ten, a pair of Big 12 Teams are off to hot starts. No. 3 Texas swept Minnesota and took Stanford to five sets. And Baylor, a program that hasn’t reached even the Sweet 16 in 10 years, shot up to No. 5 after winning at Wisconsin and at Marquette to reach 5-0.
The under-the-radar contender could be Kentucky. The SEC favorite is one of the best teams in terms of returning contributors. Junior setter Madison Lilley will try to make a case for player of the year, and there’s plenty of All-American talent around the roster.2 But the Wildcats struggled out of the gates, suffering an early-season straight-sets upset at the hands of then-unranked Utah.
Stanford’s early-season challenges are far from over: The Cardinal face three top Big Ten teams in the next week, culminating next Wednesday with a rematch of the national championship game against Nebraska. And there will be challenges throughout the year from other top teams, especially come December. But if last year is any indication, the Cardinal will be ready.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-when-the-fec-cant-do-its-job/,2019-09-09,,,features,"Sep. 4, 2019",What Happens When The FEC Can’t Do Its Job?,A FiveThirtyEight Chat,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Welcome to a special edition of FiveThirtyEight’s weekly politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Last Monday, Federal Election Commission Vice Chairman Matthew Petersen announced his resignation, leaving the FEC effectively shut down, as only three positions on the six-seat committee are currently filled and the agency is legally required to have four commissioners to be fully operational.
What this means is that the agency responsible for both enforcing and advising on the nation’s campaign-finance laws is out of commission for the foreseeable future. And because we’re in the middle of a presidential election … things could get hairy fast.
The FEC has said that it will soldier on, continuing to process filings and other reports, and has called on President Trump to nominate new commissioners and for the Senate to confirm them quickly. But Congress is still in recess and Trump has yet to move forward with appointing new commissioners (remember, there are now three vacancies).
So here with us today to unpack what this could mean for the 2020 election (and campaign finance in general) is Dave Levinthal, editor and senior reporter at the Center for Public Integrity.
Welcome!
dave.levinthal: My pleasure! Thanks for having me.
sarahf: So, first of all, how did we get to the point that the FEC is basically not operational? And just how big of a deal is this for the FEC?
dave.levinthal: You can trace the situation back to 2008, the last time the FEC found itself in semi-shutdown mode because it lacked enough commissioners to legally conduct high-level business.
That year, the FEC went about six months without a quorum of commissioners, until the Senate and President Bush finally struck a deal to appoint new commissioners and get the agency back on track.
clare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): And by “high-level business,” we mean things like opening investigations into possible campaign-finance violations?
dave.levinthal: High-level business would absolutely include investigating allegations of campaign-finance violations. As I wrote last week:
For now, the FEC can’t conduct meetings.
It can’t slap political scofflaws with fines.
It can’t make rules.
It can’t conduct audits and approve them.
sarahf: So … what can the FEC do in its current situation?
dave.levinthal: The most notable thing the FEC will continue to do is carry out its transparency function. That means that political committees, political candidates and so on must still file their periodic campaign-finance disclosures with the FEC — documents that tell the public how much money they’ve raised, spent, etc. — and the FEC staff will still review and post that material.
But if some political committee screws this up, or for that matter acts in a manner that’s potentially in violation of federal campaign-finance laws, they more or less get a temporary pass because the FEC commissioners don’t have the power for now to do anything about it.
clare.malone: Cool. I was interested to learn that there’s been a lot of discord on the commission for a while. A Democrat and an independent on the committee were apparently irritated that certain investigations they deemed worthy weren’t being looked into because the Republican members kept things from moving forward. So in some ways, it sounds like this is the continuation of an already contentious situation at the FEC.
nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): And Dave, without enforcement mechanisms, there would be no punishment if a campaign does violate campaign-finance laws, right?
dave.levinthal: Generally speaking, the FEC’s law enforcement capabilities are on ice until the Senate approves at least one more nominee to serve on the FEC.
Right now, Trump has nominated one commissioner — a Texas attorney named Trey Trainor who helped stop an anti-Trump movement at the 2016 GOP convention — who he first nominated in September 2017. But the Senate has yet to give Trainor a confirmation hearing, much less going forth and confirming him.
clare.malone: So … why no hearing? I haven’t really seen an explanation for that in everything I’ve been reading.
dave.levinthal: A complex question! My best crack at it: There’s been a tradition — often adhered to, but not always — that the president would nominate FEC commissioners in pairs: one Republican, one Democrat.
But since President Trump has only offered one nominee, the Senate has chosen not to give that lone nominee a hearing. Could it? Sure. Did it need to? Not really — until now — because the FEC has had enough commissioners to at least conduct its high-level business.
nrakich: I find it interesting that, in an age where the Senate has gotten more comfortable with consolidating power within one party (eliminating filibusters for presidents’ nominees, blocking Merrick Garland’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, etc.), that this norm of nominating one Democrat and one Republican simultaneously to the FEC has persisted.
dave.levinthal: Numbers at the FEC commission level have been going the wrong way since the beginning of the Trump presidency. In March 2017, Democratic Commissioner Ann Ravel resigned. And in February 2018, Republican Commissioner Lee Goodman also resigned. That means the FEC has been operating with a bare minimum four commissioners for 1.5 years.
President Trump could have nominated people filled those vacancies at any time, but he didn’t.
clare.malone: Whew.
Dave, champion explanation.
nrakich: Not to be too cynical, but in practical terms, how much of an effect does this shutdown really have? The FEC’s enforcement mechanisms are already pretty toothless and can take years to be resolved anyway.
For example, earlier this summer, now-Sen. Martha McSally was fined for campaign-finance violations she made in … 2014.
She has served two full terms in the House since then.
And despite breaking the rules by taking $319,000 in excess contributions, she was fined only $23,000. So there was no financial disincentive.
clare.malone: Right, and we didn’t learn about Trump’s campaign-finance violations until well after 2016, so there does seem to be a long lag time on this stuff!
dave.levinthal: I’ve heard from more than a few folks who’ve made that very point — that the FEC is already so dysfunctional that there won’t be much difference.
But even if the FEC deadlocks on investigations, even if it’s unable to make affirmative rulings on whether someone broke the law — and this is often the case — at minimum these situations receive a full public airing. For instance, if special interest groups or others vehemently disagree with an FEC ruling, they’ll sue the organization.
Think of all the big court cases that have “FEC” in their names, with Citizens United v. FEC the biggest among them. Without a functioning FEC, this process grinds to a halt, for all intents and purposes.
clare.malone: Got it. So the shutdown is really affecting the transparency of the FEC.
nrakich: I find it interesting, though, that voters don’t seem to care too much about campaign-finance violations. There’s some research suggesting that they don’t do as much as, say, sex scandals (probably for obvious reasons — they’re much drier!) to hurt candidates at the ballot box.
And I assume that most candidates will continue filing disclosure reports even if the FEC is shut down at the filing deadline. But what if they don’t? Would they really suffer any consequences with voters? I’m not sure they would, and that’s scary to me.
clare.malone: I think that’s in part because it’s so much a part of American political culture — and the culture at large — to see big money and politics as linked. There’s a perception that there’s a degree of unfettered spending going on.
dave.levinthal: While the FEC doesn’t have a quorum, if a political committee wanted to stop filing campaign-finance reports or otherwise violate campaign-finance rules, the FEC would not be in any position to do something about it.
Now, the FEC may very well pick up the matter once it’s in business again. But for now, political committees don’t really have anyone policing their activity in a way that would lead to some immediate penalty.
Said another way: The cops are at the station, they’re doing paperwork, but they’re not answering emergency calls.
sarahf: So given how critical the situation is, won’t one of Congress’s first orders of business be appointing the one commissioner Trump has already nominated to get the FEC back up and running?
dave.levinthal: Actually, Sarah, I don’t think there is a reason to think that Congress will make the FEC its first order of business. That’s not to say that the Senate won’t act quickly. But this is largely in the hands of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and, to a lesser extent, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
Also, President Trump plays a major role here. He could theoretically nominate a full slate of new commissioners. He could clean house — float six new nominees. But presidents have largely missed opportunities to proactively replace FEC commissioners. The result: The remaining commissioners continued to serve in “holdover status” — serving even though their term has expired.
sarahf: 😱
dave.levinthal: Bottom line? If Trump wanted to defy political convention — something he’s not exactly shy about doing — he could nominate six new commissioners of his choosing.
Legally, he can’t pack the committee with Republicans — no more than three commissioners can be of the same party — but he doesn’t have to nominate Democrats. He could theoretically nominate three Republicans and three … Libertarians. Or independents.
nrakich: Right. I feel like that would be well within character — but also, I feel like Trump doesn’t spend a lot of time thinking about the FEC.
sarahf: Or any president, it sounds like.
So if you’re Petersen, why resign now, knowing it would throw the FEC into chaos? Was his resignation a surprise?
dave.levinthal: No, Petersen almost left in late 2017, when Trump nominated him for a federal district judgeship. But Petersen flamed out of the judicial job when he was unable to answer a string of basic questions at his nomination hearing, and he withdrew himself from consideration shortly thereafter. His consolation prize? He continued to serve on the FEC.
At the time — December 2017 — CPI wrote that even then it seemed like the FEC had a strong possibility of losing its quorum of commissioners.
So it’s not as if this problem somehow snuck up on people.
nrakich: Yeah, I keep coming back to the fact that the public doesn’t seem to care about campaign finance.
It’s a big problem, IMO, since this is one of the main mechanisms by which we keep candidates accountable.
clare.malone: Well, very few people ever end up serving jail time for these violations, for instance. And unlike a sex scandal, a lot of people will be bored reading about campaign-finance violations.
dave.levinthal: But there are some money-in-politics sex scandals! (cough Stormy Daniels cough) And the FEC plays a role in those … or could.
nrakich: Right, and there are some types of campaign-finance scandals, like when politicians (for example, California Rep. Duncan Hunter) use campaign money for their personal benefit, that I think appeal to voters’ instinct against politicians abusing their office. But I think that’s different from, say, McSally’s case, where her only crime was accepting more than the legal limit in donations.
I fear Americans see the latter as just violations of arbitrary bureaucratic rules, rather than as an immoral act.
clare.malone: Well, not everyone sees breaking the law on certain things as a moral violation. The law doesn’t necessarily equate with morality! Lots of people might think the ends (big money) justify the means. They might not think that the moral universe extends to bureaucratic violations.
dave.levinthal: Great point, Clare, and yes — there are wide swings in opinion on whether the Stormy Daniels matter is a campaign law violation in the first place. (Michael Cohen certainly has some thoughts on this.)
clare.malone: What about for media watchdog organizations like CPI and Open Secrets, though, Dave?
How will your work potentially change because of this?
dave.levinthal: Our job is to report about the role money plays in American politics. And while most people often don’t care about the legal or technical particulars of campaign-finance law, I’ve never gotten the sense that they don’t care about campaign money, especially in the context of their favorite candidates raising cash.
There are tens of thousands of people every day who make campaign contributions, millions every year. The sophistication of political fundraising has made it as easy as ever to support a candidate or cause. That’s why, for example, you see presidential candidates — President Trump and the gaggle of Democrats — raising huge amounts of money from small-dollar donors.
nrakich: Right — and voters do seem to care about the source of the money candidates raise.
For example, every Democratic presidential candidate has pledged not to accept money from corporate PACs, and most have pledged not to accept money from the fossil-fuel industry or federal lobbyists. They wouldn’t be doing that if they didn’t think voters cared about those issues.
clare.malone: Have we seen any irregularities from any of these Democratic candidates? Or from the Trump campaign (this time around)?
dave.levinthal: No, but the FEC also won’t be in a position to address some novel questions about how political candidates should act. For example, lots of cities have sent the Trump campaign bills for police and public safety costs — related to Trump campaign rallies — that they believe the campaign should pay. The Trump campaign doesn’t acknowledge these bills and doesn’t list them as debt, or even “disputed debt,” on campaign-finance reports. It’d be the FEC’s job, ostensibly, to figure this situation out. It can’t now.
clare.malone: Oh that’s really fascinating. NYC certainly saw a lot of controversy over the cost of Trump Tower security right after his election in 2016.
sarahf: So to wrap, it sounds like as long as the FEC can still perform some of its basic functions (like getting candidates to file their reports), we might not see Petersen’s replacement for a while, right? Where does this political fight head next?
clare.malone: I guess … nowhere? Dave is certainly the expert on this, but I don’t think there’s much political will to replace the FEC positions. And I say that mostly from the point of view of public pressure — there’s no incentive to change the course of behavior toward the FEC.
nrakich: As Dave said earlier, President Bush and Congress did finally reach a deal in 2008 the last time the FEC went into limbo because it didn’t have enough members. But I agree with Clare — I think this is so far down on the to-do list for both Trump and McConnell.
Maybe the FEC becomes a poor man’s Merrick Garland — no action until one party regains full control of government.
dave.levinthal: I talked last week with Rep. Derek Kilmer, a Democrat from Washington, about the broader issue of the FEC’s role in government and politics. And he made the case that the FEC needs to be fundamentally reformed and given greater independence and strength.
He even has a bill that would make the FEC a five-commissioner body, which would address the issue of deadlocked votes. The bill isn’t going anywhere, but his hope is that Democrats will win everything in November 2020, and come 2021, the FEC will be reformed.
So I’d say keep a close watch on Schumer in the Senate. If he wants to make a big stink about this, he could. But he, too, has been pretty quiet about the FEC lately. I will also be curious to see if this comes up during the presidential debate next week, since several candidates have been very anti-Citizens United and anti-BIG MONEY in their campaign rhetoric.
nrakich: Yeah, Steve Bullock presented campaign finance as his big issue when he launched his campaign. But in general, I’ve felt that the candidates have not done a good job sticking to what was supposed to be their signature issue (Eric Swalwell and guns, Jay Inslee and climate change, etc.).
dave.levinthal: Even though Bullock has made it his signature issue, he’s had his own little bumps in the road.
clare.malone: Gillibrand also made public funding a thing, if I recall. That did not catch on.
nrakich: That said, if the FEC is shut down for a full year or more — say, through the 2020 election — I bet there will be more of an appetite to reform it come 2021 if Democrats are in charge.
Just speculating, but I think an FEC shutdown might be the kind of thing that gets more noticeable with time.
dave.levinthal: An FEC that effectively sat out the 2020 election would be monumental. It’d take us back to a pre-Watergate era of campaign-finance regulation in certain ways. (The FEC was created after Watergate to help defend against campaign money problems, irregularities and potential lawlessness.)
In fact, I’d say it’d be the most incentive Congress has probably had since Watergate to fundamentally change the nation’s campaign-finance regulation regime.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/do-we-even-need-minor-league-baseball/,2019-09-09,,,features,"Sep. 9, 2019",Do We Even Need Minor League Baseball?,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"Since the 1970s, Major League Baseball clubs have generally added more and more minor league affiliates. In 1979, there were an average of 4.7 affiliates per major league club.1 This season there are 8.2 — a total of 245 minor league affiliates, the most since 1948, spread across 30 major league organizations.
But the Houston Astros, a model of modern player development, bucked that trend a few years ago. After the 2017 season, they reduced their affiliate count from nine to seven clubs.2 The Astros believed they could become a more efficient producer of talent with fewer farm clubs.
“For the baseball people, it was a feeling that it was better to concentrate the coaching resources. We were trying to support a bunch of players that had a less than one percent chance of making the major leagues,” said an ex-Astros official whose current team didn’t grant him permission to speak to us.
The Astros felt comfortable cutting the teams in part because of data harvested from new tech. Since turning over the vast majority of their player development staff and minor league coaches under GM Jeffrey Luhnow, the Astros feel they have become better at identifying which players have a chance to rise through their system. For example, while a number of teams were experimenting with their first high-speed cameras this spring to study pitch grips and body mechanics, the Astros had 75 such cameras hard-mounted at stadiums throughout their minor league affiliates last season. According to the ex-Astros official, the team believes it needs less time and fewer games to understand potential, and it is better served by consolidating resources around their most promising players.
The Astros aren’t the only ones questioning the structure of the minor leagues in their organization. For decades, baseball has generally treated player development as a ladder. First comes Rookie ball, then multiple levels of Single-A ball leading up to Double-A, then Triple-A, then finally the majors.3 But recently some players — like young stars Juan Soto and Fernando Tatis Jr., and lesser talents like David Peralta and Rougned Odor — have skipped rungs. And they aren’t worse for it.
Is the highest level of the minors always necessary?

So if some players are good enough to skip the upper levels of the minors, perhaps minor league resources should be spent trying to identify and develop those players — and perhaps a few rungs of the ladder ought to be removed. A Baseball America study of the 1981-2010 drafts found that only 17.6 percent of drafted and signed players reached the majors, and only 9.8 percent produced 0.1 career wins above replacement, a minimal level of production. Perhaps optimized skill development requires fewer games, and thereby fewer players and teams.
A year before the closing of two affiliates, in March 2016, the Astros hired Jose Fernandez to be part of their sports science department. He had worked with pro soccer teams in Europe. European soccer giants have centralized training centers focused on building skills rather than a decentralized sprawl of affiliates. The Astros were curious how FC Barcelona developed its players. Barcelona’s “La Masia” — which translates to “Farm House” — is regarded as one of the breeding grounds for talent. The information Fernandez shared was eye-opening.
“On site in Barcelona, they have their whole development academy, from the little kids all the way up to the professional teams. They have one big campus. They do everything on-site. Everything is coordinated. Everyone is doing the same drills. Everyone was being measured with the same technology. That makes a ton of sense,” the ex-Astros front official said.
While minor league baseball reorganized in 1963 to the classifications we are familiar with today (Single-A, Double-A, etc), the idea of affiliated minor-league baseball has fundamentally remained the same since Branch Rickey bought a stake in the Houston Buffaloes in 1919 and began building the first farm system. As Kyle Boddy, who runs the independent training facility Driveline Baseball, put it in my book, “The MVP Machine”: “Why is the minor-league system set up the way it is? Why does every coaching staff and player development staff feature the same titles, the same backgrounds and are approximately the same size? Why for so long has the minor league system been immune from disruption?”
MLB’s approach to the minor leagues is ripe for change in part because of how much data can be collected off the field these days. Independent hitting instructor Doug Latta tells his clients that they “don’t need much space to get better,” as improving via reps, video analysis and ball-tracking tech lessens the need for a player to play in regulation games. Latta worked with Marlon Byrd, Justin Turner and Hunter Pence in various storage-like facilities just before they changed their approach at the plate and improved their performance. Cody Bellinger was already a good major league player but became great this season after he changed his swing in similar modest spaces last winter. While batting cages have existed since Rickey invented them, they’ve never been the feedback machines they are today when outfitted with ball-, bat- and body-tracking tech.
On the pitching side, it’s perhaps even easier to gain skills. Adam Ottavino designed a new cutter last winter in a vacant Manhattan storefront that he outfitted with baseball’s cutting-edge tech. The Los Angeles Dodgers held several low-value minor league pitchers back from minor league games in 2016, giving them something of an extended spring training at their complex to see if they could improve throwing velocity. Dodgers pitchers Corey Copping and Andrew Istler learned how to throw harder and subsequently became trade chips last summer.
Author Daniel Coyle has written about the benefits of shrinking training space — like Brazil’s futbol de salao (indoor soccer) — to increase reps and feedback. “How do you tighten the [feedback] loop, and deliver the right signal in a timely way?”
This past winter, the Philadelphia Phillies tried to become more like the Astros, rethinking how they teach and train in the minor leagues. Two progessive hitting instructors were asked to implement new ideas, new programs and new technology for the 100-plus minor league hitters in the system, tailoring individual plans for each. They have transformed batting cages at each facility into feedback labs. Phillies minor leaguers in A- and Rookie-ball are required to wear sensors on their bats to record bat speed, bat path and biomechanical data. The Phillies also set up a device to track every ball hit in every batting practice before every minor league game. For decades, box scores were the only sources of data on player progress. But now practice is producing more data than games.
“The game is the ultimate test but that’s only three or four at-bats a night,” Russ Steinhorn, one of those progressive hitting instructors, said. “The practice before games, you might be taking hundreds of swings. … For me, the practice environment, the lead-up to the game, is the most important. That’s where the development happens.”
While there are rules on how players are assigned to teams, the ex-Astros official suspects we could see fewer affiliates one day and more time spent at facilities. “I think down the road in a few years you will see a guy go to an affiliate and play for a while and the team says, ‘OK, you’ve demonstrated that what you mastered at the training facility is working in games. So now it’s time for you to add a changeup.’ So it’s back to the training facility.”
Still, Seattle outfielder Mitch Haniger — who has worked with Latta and hitting coach Craig Wallenbrock to improve his swing — says minor league games will never be replicated despite whatever gains are made in technology.
“You can’t really simulate facing a pitcher in front of thousands of people,” Haniger says, “and failing in front of a whole bunch of people.”
On a late May afternoon in Erie, Pennsylvania, the Erie Sea Wolves — the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers — hosted the Bowie Bay Sox. A light fog rolled in off the lake, UPMC Park was perhaps at half capacity. While minor league baseball remains popular and big business for big-drawing clubs like the Columbus (Ohio) Clippers and Lehigh Valley (Pennsylvania) Iron Pigs, minor league attendance declined last season for the first time in 14 years last season and by 1.38 million fans. Erie is averaging 3,315 fans this year, 10th out of 12 clubs in the league.
Top prospect Casey Mize, the No. 1 overall pick in 2018, pitched that day like he was ready to fit in the Tigers rotation. He tossed eight shutout innings on 89 pitches.
Speaking afterward in a cramped, dated and faux wood-paneled clubhouse, where the players consumed postgame meals on card tables before their lockers, Mize seemed ready for another challenge. When asked about the practice of aggressively promoting players upward, Mize said, “I think failure is part of it and needs to be part of it. I see positives in being forced to fail.”
Some influencers of modern skill-building suggest that athletes ought to push themselves through practices like weighted-ball training — called overload training — to hasten development. To increase skill, take on more than you’re used to and the body adapts and skills improve. But how does that translate to games? In the NBA and NFL, top amateur players get thrown straight into the fray against top professionals. In baseball, top prospects spend years against lesser competition. How do you improve against inferior players?
“Major league [prospects] are seeing a lot of competition that is not helping them,” the ex-Astros official said. Because of this idea that players are feasting on lesser talent, minor league numbers can distort evaluation.
All-Star pitcher Walker Buehler has been part of cutting-edge training techniques with the Los Angeles Dodgers and when pitching for Vanderbilt University. While much has been said of the low pay and financial struggles of minor-league players in recent years, Buehler thinks there’s another problem: There are too many players that aren’t MLB-quality in the minors.
“At any affiliate, there are three players who have a chance to play in the majors. The rest of the players are there so they so they can play. I don’t think that’s fair,” Buehler told FiveThirtyEight. “You are preying on their dreams.”
Rethinking the minor leagues is being discussed at the highest levels of the sport.
MLB commissioner Rob Manfred told The Athletic in July that “we have to look at the efficiency of the [minor league] system that we’re running right now, how many teams, how many players, what we’re paying players, and all those issues are obviously related.”
What that means for the future of the farm system suggests it could, and perhaps should, look much different than it does today.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

While abortions across the U.S. are down overall, the number of women leaving their home states to terminate pregnancies has slightly increased. At least 276,000 women had out-of-state procedures between 2012 and 2017, according to an Associated Press analysis, a half percentage point rise. Thirteen states saw a rise in the number of non-local women having abortions. This comes as many state lawmakers country significantly restrict abortion access. [The Associated Press]

Bianca Andreescu, just 19 years old, captured her first major title on Saturday with speed, power and confidence. To win the U.S. Open, she dominated Serena Williams — the most dominant player in the history of tennis. And that may have been proof of Andreescu’s best asset: her ability to play her best against the best.
The Canadian has never lost to a top-ranked opponent in her young career. Since her 2019 season began in Auckland, New Zealand — where she beat then-No. 3 Caroline Wozniacki — Andreescu is 8-0 against players ranked in the WTA Top 10. Going undefeated against the tennis elite to start a career is rare for even top players. Serena Williams went 5-3 in her first eight Top 10 matches, while Venus Williams won two and lost six. Monica Seles was 4-4, Steffi Graf was 2-6, and Maria Sharapova didn’t win a match, a perfect (or perfectly imperfect) 0-8.
Andreescu has been nearly unbeatable this season, with a record of 43-4 and a streak of 13 straight matches won. When she won a title at Indian Wells in March, Andreescu won three-set duels against then-No. 6 Elina Svitolina in the semifinal and No. 8 Angelique Kerber in the final. She beat Kerber again later that month in Miami. In Toronto, Andreescu upset No. 5. Kiki Bertens and No. 3 Karolína Plíšková before her final win over Serena Williams, who retired four games into the match with back spasms.
Before this U.S. Open, Andreescu had never played in the main event — failing to make it out of qualifying the previous two seasons. That’s also rare. According to the WTA, Seles was the last woman to win a major in her debut, winning the Australian Open in 1991 at the age of 17. Andreescu’s ranking, No. 178 at the end of the 2018 season, is now No. 5.
“It’s so crazy, man,” Andreescu said in her post-final press conference on Saturday. “I’ve been dreaming of this moment for the longest time.”
Andreescu showed on Saturday why she has rocketed to the top of the rankings. She serves well, even against a returner as deadly as Williams. Her forehand and backhand shots are deep and fast. She also plays with creativity, especially on drop shots.
While Andreescu was in a zone, Williams at times looked lost. The 37-year-old had eight double faults on her serve and landed her first serves just 44 percent of the time.1 She hit 33 unforced errors to Andreescu’s 17. And Williams’s second serve made Andreescu even more dangerous. Williams won just 30 percent of the points on her 43 second serves after winning 48 percent of those points this season going into the Open.
Williams gave Andreescu the credit, but she was frustrated with her own play after the loss. “I honestly don’t think Serena showed up,” Williams said. “I have to kind of figure out how to get her to show up in Grand Slam finals.”
Williams has lost eight straight sets in major finals since 2018, in matches at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. But she’s not the only women’s player to struggle for sustained success. Kerber beat Williams in Wimbledon last year but has fallen off lately, losing this year in the first round in the U.S. Open and French Open and in the second round at Wimbledon. Naomi Osaka won two straight majors, at last year’s U.S. Open and this year’s Australian Open, but she lost early in the French Open and in the first round in Wimbledon. (In this U.S. Open, she lost to Bencic in straight sets in the fourth round).
Essentially, no one has any idea who will win a women’s Grand Slam these days. There’s a lot of up-and-coming talent, like Cori “Coco” Gauff, a 15-year-old who reached the third round at the U.S. Open. That’s why Andreescu is both a surprise and totally expected — because anything can happen.
“It’s been a crazy ride this year,” Andreescu said. “I can definitely get used to this feeling.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Here’s How To Watch It Like A Pro.,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,Special Elections,"The North Carolina 9th District seat has remained vacant for a third of the 116th Congress — the fallout from a brazen case of election fraud that may have affected the outcome of the 2018 election. Allegedly, a consultant for Republican candidate Mark Harris coordinated an effort to illegally collect unsealed absentee ballots, mislead election authorities and, in some cases, fill out ballots on behalf of voters. As a result, the North Carolina State Board of Elections voted in February to redo the congressional race and later set a new election for Sept. 10. Now, the 9th District will finally vote on a new representative in an election that could go either way. Here’s a look at what’s already happened in the campaign — and what to expect when results roll in after polls close at 7:30 p.m.
1. The candidates
Politically radioactive in the wake of the 2018 scandal, Harris declined to run in the new election, and Republicans nominated state Sen. Dan Bishop in May. On the Democratic side, 2018 candidate Dan McCready is back for a second bite of the apple. A Marine veteran who started a solar-power investment firm, the 36-year-old fits the fresh-faced, moderate mold of many of the Democrats’ most successful 2018 candidates. And buoyed by the national attention he received from Democrats who believe he was cheated out of a congressional seat, McCready has also raised more than $4.8 million in total contributions between Jan. 1 and Aug. 21. By contrast, Bishop has raised less than $1.7 million in total contributions.
But conservative PACs have more than closed the gap. Led by the National Republican Congressional Committee, as of Monday, outside groups had spent more than $6.8 million to campaign either for Bishop or against McCready. Taking both campaign and outside spending into account, pro-Bishop forces have spent at least1 $8.6 million so far this year, and pro-McCready forces have spent $8.4 million.
Last year’s election fraud has played only a small role in this year’s campaign; according to Roll Call, it has surfaced mostly in the smaller, eastern part of the district where the irregularities took place. And instead, McCready has focused on health care — the same issue that helped Democrats flip the House in 2018 — attacking Bishop for voting against a bill to inform patients about low-cost prescription drugs and opposing Medicaid expansion. Meanwhile, Bishop and his allies have hammered McCready for his ties to an organization that lobbied against lower renewable-energy standards, which they claim benefited McCready’s business at the cost of higher utility bills for the general public.
Republicans have also tried hard to nationalize the race. While McCready has distanced himself from the “crazy aspirational things” being discussed by the Democratic 2020 presidential candidates, President Trump has starred in Bishop’s closing ad, recorded a pro-Bishop robocall and held a campaign rally for him in Fayetteville on Monday night. That could be a boon to Bishop, as Trump carried the 9th District by 12 percentage points in 2016.
2. The district
Normally, Republicans would indeed have an edge in the North Carolina 9th District. Until January, it was represented by GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger, and according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric,2 it is 14 points redder than the nation as a whole. But we are in a Democratic-leaning national environment (albeit not quite as favorable as 2018), and McCready has already proved himself a strong candidate. In the 2018 general election, Harris got only 905 more votes than McCready, a margin that would have made it the third-closest House race (by percentage points) of 2018.
So it may be a cliché, but the election may well come down to turnout; not all parts of this diverse district may vote in equal numbers. The 9th District runs over 100 miles along the South Carolina border, from Charlotte in the west to Fayetteville in the east. One crucial area to watch will be the part of Mecklenburg County that overlaps with the 9th District — a wealthy, predominantly white wedge of metro Charlotte that has rapidly transitioned from red to blue in the Trump era. McCready won it by 10 points in the original 2018 election, and based on last year’s voting patterns, anything more than that will put him on pace to win districtwide. Even matching that 2018 performance, however, might be enough, since Mecklenburg may constitute an unusually large share of the 9th District vote this year. That’s because Charlotte is also holding its municipal primaries on Tuesday, which could increase turnout in those parts of the district. Even better for McCready, most of the contested races are on the Democratic side, potentially boosting turnout among his base of registered Democrats.
On the other hand, next-door Union County — home to some farther-flung Charlotte suburbs like Indian Trail and Monroe — is still the district’s richest source of Republican votes. If Bishop wins it by more than Harris’s 20-point margin, it will be a good sign for the GOP. Finally, the six smaller counties east of Union are home to a mix of black, Native American and working-class white voters. McCready won those counties by a combined margin of 7 points, but they’re a bit of a wild card for the do-over election, as it’s hard to predict which of these demographics will turn out for such an oddly-timed contest.
3. The polls
We’ve seen four public polls of the 9th District in the last two months, and they all suggest a close race. A poll from late August, sponsored by Inside Elections and conducted jointly by Harper Polling and Clarity Campaign Labs, had the best news for McCready, giving him a 5-point lead when “leaners” were included. However, a concurrent poll, paid for by readers of the Republican-leaning blog RRH Elections, gave Bishop a 1-point edge.

Although McCready has a slight lead if you average the polls, remember that polls of U.S. House elections are not as precise as those for president or Senate — since 1998, they have been off by an average of 6.2 percentage points. And according to CNN, the true margin of error of polls of special U.S. House elections in recent years is ±13 percentage points! Basically, these polls tell us that any outcome is possible in the 9th District except a blowout.
4. The bottom line
The 9th District is the district to watch, but it should be noted that it isn’t the only place in North Carolina holding a congressional election on Tuesday. A much lower-profile special election is also taking place in the coastal 3rd District, whose former congressman, Walter Jones, passed away in February. Given the district’s R+24 partisan lean, GOP state Rep. Greg Murphy is expected to easily defeat his Democratic opponent, former Greenville Mayor Allen Thomas. The only poll we have of the contest gave the Republican a 51-40 lead.
But even though the outcome is in little doubt, you should still pay attention to the final margin, as what happens in both the 3rd and 9th Districts could be telling of the national political environment. Strong Democratic performances in special elections, even in safe Republican districts, were some of the first signs of a strong Democratic year in 2018. That said, turnout could be especially low in the 3rd District as a result of Hurricane Dorian, which made landfall there on Friday, limiting our ability to extrapolate the results. But watch this space on Wednesday for an article putting these two election results in the context of other special elections from the past few years.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

8 executive orders
Texas is making moves to prevent mass shootings — but not to restrict gun access. Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday issued eight executive orders in response to shootings in Odessa and El Paso. The measures largely try to improve how tips and intelligence about potential shooters is handled by law enforcement. In a statement, Abbott pledged to “keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals” while preserving 2nd amendment rights. [Texas Tribune]
2 people
A second person in the U.S. has died from a lung illness linked to vaping. Health officials say symptoms were consistent with reports of other vaping-related respiratory illnesses around the country. This most recent report in Oregon involved marijuana. The first reported death happened in Illinois after the victim used an e-cigarette. [ABC News]
More than 1,000 names
Jeffrey Epstein had a lot of names in his address book. Court documents reveal hundreds of people connected to the former financier and convicted sex offender. One attorney said the people are named in depositions, investigatory records and an address book listing more than 1,000 names. One man known as John Doe petitioned the judge this week to keep the records sealed. [The New York Times]
$4.5 million fine
The U.S. Department of Education has fined Michigan State University $4.5 million for failing to address abuse committed by Larry Nassar. The MSU and USA Gymnastics doctor was sentenced to up to 175 in prison after decades of sexually assaulting patients. The fine is a record amount, and the second major Title IX violation for MSU in the last five years. [Detroit Free Press]
13 states
Sports betting is here and Americans are ready to win — or more likely lose — some money. As the NFL season kicks off, football fans in 13 states can now gamble legally. About five additional states and the District of Columbia are also poised to open legal markets soon. So what do big winnings mean for federal taxes? Fortunately for you casual gamblers, the IRS wants to make things easy. [CNBC]
56 percent
Big brother is watching, but most Americans are cool with that. More than half of U.S. adults trust police to use facial recognition responsibly, according to the Pew Research Center. Fifty-six percent of respondents said they either trust law enforcement “a great deal” or “somewhat” in using the technology to address security threats. Facial recognition has become a popular policing tool in the U.S., despite pushback from civil rights groups. Say cheese? [Pew Research Center]

But when he takes the field as the Giants’ Week 1 starter — as he has every season for the past 14 — he may be ready for a new title: “Expendable.”
Every year, 32 quarterbacks line up for the first snap of the first game of the season. That player is supposed to be the best quarterback on the team.1 But sometimes, that quarterback isn’t the best by very much. Or he gets hurt, and his backup gets hot enough to win the job away. Or he’s just marking time while a highly drafted rookie gets up to speed.
That was the situation in 2004, when two-time NFL MVP Kurt Warner took the field for the Giants as their nominal starter — but many on the field, in the stands and watching at home on TV knew he was just there to hold down the fort until their grinning greenhorn of a No. 1 overall draft pick was ready.
That 2004 No. 1 overall draft pick? Manning himself.
But Warner and Manning, highly decorated veterans, don’t fit the typical profile of an Expendable. These are often journeymen brought in because they have a relationship with a coach, or they’re unheralded draft picks from a few years ago who won a war of attrition with players higher on the depth chart.
Over the past 10 seasons, 46 different quarterbacks have qualified — and a few have carved out a niche for themselves as professional Expendables.

For our purposes, we’re calling a quarterback an Expendable if he a) started Week 1 of a given season, b) was benched while healthy (or did not get his job back after returning from injury) and c) did not go on to start Week 1 for that same team the following season. Backups filling in for unquestioned starters during injury or suspension, like Jimmy Garoppolo for Tom Brady in 2016, were not counted.
But Shaun Hill did get the honor in 2016: He was the No. 2 for the Minnesota Vikings when starter Teddy Bridgewater went down with a preseason injury, and he filled in well even though the Vikings had just swung a panicked trade for Sam Bradford. His performance was good enough to buy him just one start. Combined with losing his 2014 starting gig with the then-St. Louis Rams and getting benched in San Francisco for Alex Smith, Hill has been an Expendable for three different teams (and lasted an average of just 2.7 games over those three seasons).
It makes sense that well-traveled journeymen like Ryan Fitzpatrick and Josh McCown have served multiple tours of duty as an Expendable. But Brian Hoyer also parlayed his time backing up Tom Brady into Expendable stints with his hometown Browns, the Houston Texans and the 49ers. Donovan McNabb seems like another surprising inclusion — but it’s no surprise that after his 11-year run in Philadelphia, during which he went to the Pro Bowl six times, his back-to-back Expendable tours in Washington and Minnesota are often forgotten.
Our exceptions for injuries mean that former No. 1 overall pick Bradford qualified for the Expendable badge only twice,2 but he merits a mention here, too. In 2018, he received a $20 million contract to steer a listless Arizona Cardinals team while first-round pick Josh Rosen learned the ropes. After three woeful starts, Bradford was demoted to No. 3 on the depth chart, and Rosen was thrown into the fire.
Compared with the rest of the past decade, NFL head coaches have been quick to yank starting quarterbacks in the last two seasons — or maybe NFL general managers have been further off the mark about who’s really capable of starting in the first place.

From 2009 to 2016, an average of 5.3 Week 1 starters relinquished their gigs to their backups; it happened after an average of 5.6 games. But in 2017 and 2018, an average of 7.5 starters were demoted — and after an average of just 4.5 games. How will that play out in 2019?
For Manning and the Giants, Vegas sportsbooks initially set the over/under on the number of games Daniel Jones will start this season at 7.5. In Tennessee, former No. 2 overall pick Marcus Mariota is reportedly on a “short leash,” so Ryan Tannehill could turn him into an Expendable before the season ends.
After those two, there aren’t many obvious possibilities. Rookie Drew Lock, a second-round draft pick, is buried at third on the depth chart in Denver. It’s possible the Tampa Bay Buccaneers give up on Jameis Winston, but it’s hard to see Blaine Gabbert taking his job by outperforming him in practice.
The next possible Expendable, though, is an intriguing one: Fitzpatrick.
The Cardinals gave up on Rosen less than a year after they gave up on Bradford. They drafted Rosen’s successor, Kyler Murray, No. 1 overall, but they’re not making Rosen an Expendable — they’ve traded him away.
But look who they traded him to: the Miami Dolphins, who just signed Fitzpatrick to a two-year deal. Though Fitzpatrick was tabbed as the Week 1 starter, Rosen’s impressive preseason play had many calling for him to start in the season opener. Can Rosen, a second-year quarterback showing flashes, push Fitzpatrick to the bench the way Winston, Geno Smith and Ryan Mallett did?
If that happens, Fitzpatrick will officially be the most Expendable quarterback in the NFL, a dubious — yet somehow still impressive — honor.

Every week for the last four years, Oliver Roeder has offered up problems related to the things we hold dear around here: math, logic and probability. I will do my best to continue that legacy as The Riddler’s new editor.
As you may know, two puzzles are presented each week: the Riddler Express for those of you who want something bite-size and the Riddler Classic for those of you in the slow-puzzle movement. Submit a correct answer for either,1 and you may get a shoutout in next week’s column. If you need a hint or have a favorite puzzle collecting dust in your attic, find me on Twitter.
Riddler Express
You and your friend are playing a game of “Acchi, Muite, Hoi” (or what some on Twitter have been calling the “lookaway challenge”). In the first round, you point in one of four directions: up, down, left or right. At the exact same time, your friend also looks in one of those four directions. If your friend looks in the same direction you’re pointing, you win! Otherwise, you switch roles as the game continues to the next round — now your friend points in a direction and you try to look away. As long as no one wins, you keep switching off who points and who looks.
It seems like your chances of winning should be 50 percent, since there are exactly two players. But surely it’s not that simple. If both you and your friend choose your directions randomly in each round, what are your chances of winning?

Riddler Classic
The U.S. Open is upon us! Dave Moran and Erich Friedman each submitted a tennis-themed puzzle that asked what it really takes to succeed in the tournament.
Suppose you’re playing a match at the U.S. Open, and you’re slightly better than the competition: your chances of winning any given point are exactly 55 percent. (Yes, most players are more likely to win the points they serve, but we’re simplifying things a bit.) What are your chances of winning a three-set match, as played by the women, or a five-set match, as played by the men? And what are your chances of winning the whole tournament (seven consecutive matches)?
If you’re not familiar with the scoring system in tennis, you can read more about it here. In short, the first to 4 points wins a game (as long as they’ve won 2 more points than their opponent), the first to six games wins a set (as long as they’ve won two more games), and the first to two sets (for women) or three sets (for men) wins the match. If at any point a set is tied at six games apiece, that set is decided by a tiebreaker, in which the first to 7 points wins (with the same 2-point margin rule applying here).
You know, I thought tennis scoring was pretty straightforward until I had to write it down.

Solution to last week’s Riddler
At long last, Riddler Nation has a new warlord! All hail 👑 David Love 👑 of Ambler, Pennsylvania, winner of last week’s Riddler!
Longtime puzzle editor Oliver Roeder’s tenure concluded with the fourth (but certainly not final) installment of the Riddler Nation Battle Royale. Here is how he described the rules: In a distant, war-torn land, there were 10 castles. There were two warlords: you and your archenemy. Each castle had its own strategic value for a would-be conqueror. Specifically, the castles were worth 1, 2, 3, …, 9 and 10 victory points. You and your enemy each had 100 soldiers to distribute, in any way you like, to fight at any of the 10 castles. Whoever sent more soldiers to a given castle conquered that castle and won its victory points. (If you each sent the same number of troops, you split the points.) You didn’t know the distribution of the enemy forces until the battles began. Whoever won the most points won the war.
You submitted a plan distributing your 100 soldiers among the 10 castles. I took all these battle plans and adjudicated every possible one-on-one matchup.
I received more than 1,000 battle plans, of which more than 900 were valid.2 Here’s a graphic that shows the strategies of all those entries:

Each row is a different warlord (the best warlords are at the top, the worst are at the bottom), and each column is a different castle (1 is on the left, 10 is on the right). Castles with more soldiers are shaded darker. The 10 castles are collectively worth 55 points, so to win a match you needed to collect at least 28 points. At a glance, you can see that strategies where soldiers were more evenly distributed didn’t fare as well, while the strongest warlords focused their efforts on collecting exactly 28 points in each match. Sure enough, the best warlords placed most of their soldiers on castles 4, 5, 9, and 10, which together are worth 28 points.
Here were the top performers:

As noted in the table, former two-time top warlord Vince Vatter did well, but not well enough to retain his title. I’m sure Vince will exact revenge in the next battle.
There’s a lot of data to digest here, so I hope all you aspiring warlords learn from our winners! If you have ideas for tweaking the rules to mix things up (e.g., 13 castles instead of 10, as Vince has suggested), let me know. Surely, Riddler Nation won’t have a second two-time champion…

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mvps-used-to-need-a-good-team-behind-them-then-mike-trout-came-along/,2019-09-06,,,features,"Sep. 6, 2019",MVPs Used To Need A Good Team Behind Them. Then Mike Trout Came Along.,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"No sport loves parsing out the “best player” vs. “most valuable” argument in MVP debates more than baseball. Sure, the NBA hasn’t given its MVP to a player on a nonplayoff team since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1976. But the best basketball players exert so much more influence on the game than their baseball counterparts that it’s difficult to have individual success without the team coming along for the ride. For MLB players, however, we frequently see good — and even historically great — seasons on bad teams. That creates a perfect recipe for all those endless debates about what “value” really means.
Will it happen again this year? Some of the ingredients are there in the American League. AL wins above replacement1 leader Mike Trout is tracking for 9.7 WAR (prorated to 162 team games), which would once again rank among the top 100 individual campaigns by a batter since 1901. (He’s already had three of those in his eight full MLB seasons, and he came extraordinarily close to a fourth in 2013.) But his Los Angeles Angels are, once again, lousy. Our predictions think they’ll finish 20 games out of the playoff race, with a lowly 74-88 record.
But before we dig in for one more round of online MVP bickering, another factor should come into play: This year’s AL MVP landscape is weird. There’s so much else going on, Trout could very well avoid too much friction along his path to putting a third Kenesaw Mountain Landis Award on his mantle.
First, how big is Trout’s edge in individual value? The gap between his WAR and that of Houston Astros third baseman Alex Bregman, who ranks second in the AL, is 1.9 wins if prorated over 162 games. (That’s basically an entire season’s worth of value from an average player!) Limiting to cases in which the top two in WAR were both position players, the only league leader since 2002 with a wider gap came in the 2012 AL, when Trout himself was 2.5 wins ahead of No. 2 Robinson Cano. (Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera famously took home the MVP instead after winning the Triple Crown.) About three-quarters of WAR leaders in the modern MVP award era2 lead the league by a smaller margin than Trout is on pace to beat Bregman by.
Historically speaking, though, Trout’s MVP case would be better served if he were on a team with a slightly better record, even if his personal stats were worse. To examine this, I built a model3 predicting a league WAR leader’s chances of winning the MVP based on his differentials (relative to the No. 2 player) in both WAR and team winning percentage.4 According to the model, Trout would have better MVP odds than he currently does — with a 1.9-WAR lead on a .461 winning-percentage team — if his WAR lead got trimmed to a half-win but his team won just three or four more ballgames:

(It’s worth noting that this effect is more descriptive than causal — we don’t know how Trout, or any other player, would play on a different team alongside better teammates. But for the purposes of illustration, it’s clear that MVP voters are traditionally very responsive to players on better teams, even if they have a much smaller WAR lead than Trout currently has over Bregman.)
In general, MVP voters have long tended to smile more on players with solid stats on winning teams than players with dominant numbers amidst a string of defeats. Only seven modern-era MVP winners were on teams with a losing record: Giancarlo Stanton (2017), Trout (2016), Alex Rodriguez (2003), Cal Ripken Jr. (1991), Andre Dawson (1987) and Ernie Banks (1958 and 1959). And among those, only three played for a team whose record was as bad as the current Angels’ is: Trout in 2016, Rodriguez in 2003 and Ripken in 1991. Similar to his MVP bid in 2016, another Trout win would be a rare victory for great players on bad teams — and another sign that voters are redefining the way they make that distinction between the “most valuable” and “best” players.
But Trout might also get some help from just how scattershot the competition is in this year’s AL MVP race. Aside from Bregman and fellow Astros Justin Verlander and George Springer, Oakland’s Matt Chapman and Marcus Semien are the only other members of the AL’s top 10 in WAR on a team with any kind of playoff odds whatsoever.

Many of the other elite performers on this list are matching the mold Trout has fit all too often: great player, not-so-great team. Texas’s Mike Minor and Lance Lynn have each had unexpectedly outstanding seasons, but the Rangers are below .500 — and again, pitchers are usually undervalued in MVP voting anyway. Boston has two top-line candidates in defending MVP right fielder Mookie Betts and shortstop Xander Bogaerts (plus a third if you count third baseman Rafael Devers, who ranks 12th in AL WAR), but the champs have almost no chance of making the postseason. The best of the A’s duo, Chapman, is on pace to run nearly 3 full WAR behind Trout by year’s end. And Houston has hoarded enough elite individual performances to potentially dilute each player’s MVP case, leaving Bregman as just one of many Astros who could claim credit for the team’s blistering 104-win pace this season.
Perhaps all of this is why Trout is such an overwhelming favorite in the betting odds for the award. As of Sept. 2, the money line on Trout winning MVP was -1000, which implies a 90.9 percent chance of taking home the hardware.5 (Running second in the odds, with a 12.5 percent implied probability, was actually DJ LeMahieu of the Yankees, who ranks only 14th in the league in WAR, followed by Bregman at 9.1 percent.)
Seldom in the entire history of baseball would voters consider the best player on a 74-win team — even a player as great as Trout — worthy of the game’s top individual honor. But in a season when so many other top players are either also toiling on bad teams or facing vote-splitting amongst star teammates, Trout appears to be the choice regardless of whether you prefer the “best” or “most valuable” player as your MVP.

She’s been steadily gaining support since the spring, when she was polling around fifth place, and is now neck-and-neck with Bernie Sanders, according to RealClearPolitics’ polling average. Early-state activists think she’s gaining momentum, the most plugged-in subset of Democrats seems to be coalescing behind her, and she’s well-liked among primary voters. But she’s still not within striking distance of Joe Biden, who continues to hold a double-digit lead over the rest of the field.
Of course, that could change if Warren convinced a significant chunk of Democratic women voters to join her coalition. Women make up about 60 percent of Democratic primary voters and typically turn out at higher rates than men, and with only five women left in the race, Warren is carving out a space for herself on gender issues. She has announced ambitious plans to protect abortion rights, narrow the pay gap for women of color, establish universal child care and combat maternal mortality. And although Warren has struggled so far to gain support among black and Hispanic voters, she’s pitched many of her policies on gender specifically to women of color.
But is it realistic to expect Warren to win over women in the primary? A study by CBS News and YouGov conducted earlier this year found that Democratic women were much more likely to prioritize female candidates in a series of hypothetical matchups, but it turns out there’s very little evidence that women voters, as a group, tend to gravitate toward female candidates. That’s especially true in general elections, but it also likely holds for a race like the Democratic primary.
Warren is not overwhelmingly popular among women right now, but she has had a small, consistent edge among women in recent polls. Our average of national polls1 taken between Aug. 1 and Sep. 1 do show Warren getting some extra support from women, though not to a huge degree. Women were 2.9 points more likely than men to support Warren on average, while both Biden’s and Harris’s backers were nearly identically split between men and women — with Biden getting the most backing from both groups. And according to Morning Consult’s weekly national primary poll, Biden’s support is particularly strong among black women, too.

There’s a certain resonance to the idea that women will rally around fellow women when they run for office — and recent polling has shown that Democratic women are particularly eager to elect a female president. But this doesn’t mean Warren — or any female candidate, for that matter — will overwhelmingly win women in the primary. For one thing, a gender gap in voting patterns may not tell us much about why women are supporting a particular candidate. Over the years, political scientists have found that even when women do vote for female candidates, it’s usually not because the candidate is a woman. Meanwhile, Warren’s emphasis on closing the wage gap or reducing maternal mortality might help her draw in more voters who care about gender discrimination, but those voters won’t just be women. After all, people’s reasons for voting are complicated, and women — even within a single party — are far from a monolithic voting bloc.
“What looks like women voting for women is usually just women voting for Democrats,” said Kathleen Dolan, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. There’s very little evidence, Dolan said, to suggest that the desire to vote for a woman, even one who’s strong on women’s issues, binds female voters together — or if that desire exists, it’s weaker than the other forces that affect their political decisions.
Yes, women are disproportionately likely to vote for Democratic candidates, and female candidates are also disproportionately likely to be Democrats. But what Dolan and others have found is that what often looks like gender solidarity is in large part good old-fashioned partisanship. Take a look at the results of the 2016 election, when a majority of white women voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton, or the 2008 election, when Sarah Palin’s presence on the ticket did little to entice Democratic women, and it’s clear that party loyalty trumps female solidarity.
The more difficult question, of course, is what happens in a primary, where all the competition is between candidates of the same party. One recent study of judicial elections found that when party preferences were removed, women were substantially more likely to gravitate toward female candidates. That could indicate that women might be more likely to support female candidates in a primary, where party also isn’t a factor. But Alex Badas, a political science professor at the University of Houston and a co-author of that study, cautioned that voters don’t usually have much information about judicial candidates when they walk into the polling booth. “People know so much more about the presidential candidates,” he said. “So even if they can’t make a decision based on party, there are many other factors that could outweigh the candidate’s gender.”
In fact, other studies have shown that other parts of women’s identities — race, education, religion — seem to be more central to how they vote. Several studies of the 2008 primaries concluded that while many black voters did seem drawn to Obama because of their shared racial identity, Clinton didn’t benefit as much from women’s enthusiasm. And in the 2016 primaries, a strong sense of shared gender identity also wasn’t a predictor of support for Clinton.
This is not to say that gender doesn’t shape the way voters think about politics or choose which candidate to support. It’s possible that at least some Democratic women want to support Warren or Harris, but are holding back because they’re afraid that sexism will hurt a woman’s chances against Trump. For instance, Biden led the pack as usual in an Avalanche Strategy poll conducted earlier this summer, but when respondents were told they could wave a “magic wand” and make any of the candidates president, Warren was their top choice. And when respondents were asked what their “magic wand” candidate could change in order to win, the candidate’s gender was by far the most common answer, with women particularly likely to point to gender as a factor.
But whether a voter is a man or a woman likely matters less than how they think about gender when it comes to supporting a female candidate. One recent study found, for instance, that respondents’ gender was less predictive than their views about the prevalence of gender discrimination in determining their willingness to support a female candidate who had been attacked by her opponent. “Supporting gender equality, or being concerned about an issue like sexual harassment — that is a predictor of voting for women,” said Danny Hayes, a political science professor at George Washington University and one of the co-authors of that study. “But in a Democratic primary, that’s going to describe a lot of men as well as women.”
So Warren might still win over voters by emphasizing her policies on gender issues — her appeal just won’t be limited to women. In fact, there’s a good chance that the voters who are more likely to prioritize something like gender equality are also more likely to have higher levels of education, according to Hayes. That could partly explain Warren’s rise, since she’s performing especially well among white, educated voters.
But it also suggests that both Warren’s gender and her ambitious menu of policies to help women may not do much to help her broaden her coalition where she needs it most — particularly among black and Hispanic Democrats, who are largely sticking with Biden so far. “Warren might be able to chip away at Biden’s lead — but I wouldn’t expect it to be primarily driven by female voters,” Hayes said.

Fresh off of their sixth Super Bowl win with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick at the helm, the defending champion New England Patriots open the 2019 season as our favorite to win again. The rest of the top contenders are similar to last season’s as well: the Kansas City Chiefs, New Orleans Saints, Los Angeles Rams and Philadelphia Eagles round out the top five in Super Bowl odds, according to our predictions.
But our NFL Elo model has changed in a somewhat significant way. You can read more about how it all works here, but in a nutshell, we have added a number of wrinkles to make our football picks more accurate:
Quarterback adjustments. We hinted at this over the summer, but we now track rolling performance ratings1 for each QB in the league, which can then be compared with a team’s own rolling QB rating to adjust its Elo in games with a different quarterback starting.2 (Related to this, we have a new interactive page that shows the relative quality of every quarterback in the league.)3
What would Vegas do? In the past, our preseason ratings would simply be each team’s final rating from the previous season, reverted to the league’s average Elo rating by one-third. But our new system also incorporates ratings derived from a team’s over/under win total according to the Las Vegas sportsbooks, giving those twice the weight of mean-reverted Elo when setting a team’s preseason rating.
Travel distance and rest matter. We used to give a blanket home-field advantage of 65 Elo points for every game that wasn’t at a neutral site. Now, we modify our home-field effect4 using the distance the visiting team needed to travel to get to the game, docking a team by 4 points of Elo for every 1,000 miles traveled.5 Teams also perform better after a bye week (including teams that don’t play during the opening week of the playoffs), so we now give a bonus of 25 Elo points whenever a team is coming into a game fresh and extra-rested.
The playoffs are different. We found that differences in talent between opposing teams tend to be amplified in the NFL postseason, so now Elo differentials are multiplied by 1.2 before computing the expected win probabilities and point spreads for playoff games.
Altogether, these changes improved our historical predictions by quite a bit in backtesting, so we’re feeling confident that our 2019 picks will be better than ever before.6
And what are those picks, exactly? Let’s run down what our Elo model thinks of each division in the NFL, starting with…

As we said above, the Patriots are not only the division favorites (for what feels like the millionth consecutive season) but are also the model’s top Super Bowl pick. Their fate is tied to Tom Brady continuing to play well at an age when basically no other QB has done that, of course, and he’ll have to do it without favorite security blanket Rob Gronkowski, who retired in March. But Brady hasn’t shown many signs of slowing down yet, and he’ll get to face the NFL’s easiest schedule7 in 2019. Perhaps surprisingly, Elo gives the Bills a slight edge over the Jets for second place in the East. Both teams’ sophomore QBs (Josh Allen and Sam Darnold) played well down the stretch last season, though our model likes Allen a bit more. New York had the more eventful offseason, signing Le’Veon Bell and abruptly firing GM Mike Maccagnan, but the Bills might have made steadier progress. And the Dolphins bring up the rear, though they have the division’s second-highest rated Elo QB in newcomer Ryan Fitzpatrick. (Amid questions of Miami tanking, Vegas gives the Phins 500-to-1 Super Bowl odds, the worst in football.)

Rumors of the Steelers’ demise appear to have been greatly exaggerated. Despite a tumultuous offseason that involved officially losing Bell8 and also shipping receiver Antonio Brown to the Raiders, Pittsburgh remains the top-ranked team in the North. Part of that is thanks to Ben Roethlisberger, who checks in as Elo’s No. 1 overall QB, and part of it is because the Steelers have one of the league’s easiest schedules. The Ravens and Browns are neck-and-neck behind them; Elo is skeptical about Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson after he posted not-so-great numbers as a rookie, but it thinks his supporting cast is superior to Baker Mayfield’s in Cleveland — despite the Browns’ big offseason (hi, Odell) and general hype level heading into 2019. Meanwhile, the Bengals are a distant No. 4, as QB Andy Dalton has seen better days, and the team is breaking in a first-time head coach (Zac Taylor).

The AFC South experienced a dramatic shakeup when Andrew Luck retired two weeks ago, giving the division a whole new favorite: the Texans. Now, Houston is in somewhat tenuous possession of that distinction, with No. 6-ranked QB Deshaun Watson leading the way — despite last weekend’s bombshell trade that shipped star pass-rusher Jadeveon Clowney to Seattle. The Titans aren’t far behind Houston, although QB Marcus Mariota has regressed over the past few years: In Week 12 of the 2016 season, his Elo adjustment would have been 61 points higher than an average quarterback; now it’s 34 points below average. The Jaguars are right in the mix as well, thanks in part to the acquisition of former Eagles backup Nick Foles; Foles adds 14 points of Elo compared with the team’s long-term historical QB rating (i.e., Blake Bortles). Finally, the Colts went from first to last in Elo’s division prediction — literally overnight — after Luck retired. Backup Jacoby Brissett is worth about 90 fewer Elo points by himself than Luck would have been — a huge blow to Indy’s chances of making a return trip to the playoffs. Even so, this is the most uncertain division race in the league.

The Chiefs are the second-most-likely team to win the Super Bowl, trailing only the Patriots. One of the biggest reasons: Elo ranks Patrick Mahomes as the fourth-most-valuable QB in the league behind Roethlisberger, Matt Ryan and Drew Brees. Although K.C. will probably regress some after last year’s breakout (we think the Chiefs’ point differential will fall from +144 to +79), and the defense is no better than average (it ranks 16th in ESPN’s preseason Football Power Index), we think this is the team most likely to dethrone New England. The Chargers aren’t running very far behind, either, ranking sixth in overall Elo. L.A. didn’t do much over the offseason — and its trademark injury problems are already cropping up — but this remains one of the most talented rosters in the game. The gap between this division’s top two and bottom two is vast. The Broncos upgraded under center with former Ravens QB Joe Flacco, but he’s still mediocre at best. Late summer for the Raiders has been a circus even by the standards of a “Hard Knocks” team; maybe Brown will improve QB Derek Carr’s numbers, but the team has plenty of other question marks. Oakland and Denver won’t be helped by playing the two toughest schedules in the league, either.

Last year, the defending champion Eagles suffered a historic hangover to start their 2018 season, but eventually righted the ship to make the playoffs and even win a first-round game. Armed with Elo’s eighth-ranked QB (Carson Wentz), a talented supporting cast and one of the easiest schedules in the NFL, our model thinks Philadelphia should be division favorites in 2019 — particularly if the Eagles have better injury luck. The defending East champ Cowboys might have something to say about the Eagles being favorites, however, regardless of the holdout of RB Ezekiel Elliott. We rank QB Dak Prescott ninth in Elo, right behind Wentz. Once again trailing in the division are the Giants and Redskins; Washington has the better Elo rating but is slightly less likely to make the playoffs because of a tougher schedule than that of New York. Fittingly, both teams have mediocre veteran QBs (Eli Manning and Case Keenum) trying to fend off highly drafted rookies (Daniel Jones and Dwayne Haskins).

This is the tightest division race in the NFC. The Bears are favored to win again, though Mitchell Trubisky is Elo’s second-lowest rated QB in the North. (He’s 13th overall, so it mainly speaks to the quality of passers in this division.) On the other side of the ball, the amount of talent on Chicago’s defense is impressive, a necessary component as the Bears are hoping to repeat as last year’s stingiest defense in terms of points allowed. The Vikings come in slightly lower but are still 13th overall by the Elo rankings. So should we blame QB Kirk Cousins for Minnesota’s disappointing 2018 season? Probably not. Although his Elo rating wasn’t as high as during his 2016 or 2017 campaigns, Cousins was good for most of last year, and he enters 2019 as our 12th-ranked quarterback. But the best QB Elo in the division belongs to Aaron Rodgers of the Packers. Even if former coach Mike McCarthy didn’t always put him in the best position to succeed, Rodgers still had solid numbers last season and is currently ranked seventh in QB Elo. (It’s the rest of the roster that’s holding Green Bay back from a division probability better than that 24 percent.) Last, we have the Lions. They project to finish fourth, with QB Matthew Stafford coming off his worst season in years and a second-year coach already on the hot seat. But we do call for Detroit to return to its rightful place in the NFL standings, with roughly a 7-9 record, after last season’s 6-10 hiatus.

At the top of the NFC South, we have Drew Brees and the Saints coming in as favorites to win the division for a third straight year. Elo rates Brees as the league’s third-best QB, even though he sputtered down the stretch of last season and will turn 41 in January. Fortunately for New Orleans, its supporting cast appears to be good enough to help ease Brees into old age, ranking eighth in QB-independent Elo.9 As for the Falcons, Matt Ryan is No. 2 in our QB rankings, but the rest of the team ranks 25th in QB-independent Elo. That’s more an indictment of a defense that ranks 23rd in preseason projected FPI than an offense that still includes hyper-productive WR Julio Jones, but Atlanta is hoping that a coaching staff of all new coordinators can help Ryan. The Panthers are still only three seasons removed from a Super Bowl appearance, but they’ve gone exactly 24-24 since then. Elo calls for more of the same this season, with an 8-8 projected record, although Carolina does have the No. 10 QB in our rankings (Cam Newton) and a respectable 38 percent chance of getting back to the playoffs. Finally, the Buccaneers are hoping to end the franchise’s postseason drought at 11 seasons — but they need to improve on last year’s horrid defensive performance and get more consistency from both Jameis Winston and a passing attack that had the third-highest game-to-game QB Elo variance10 of any team in 2018.

The Rams are coming off a Super Bowl run, and there were times last season when they looked unbeatable, not least because of a GOAT-level performance by defensive lineman Aaron Donald. But with questions remaining about QB Jared Goff and RB Todd Gurley — to say that neither were major factors in the playoffs would be an understatement — L.A. might be due for a regression, even if Elo does still consider the Rams division favorites. A number of signs point to a decline, from L.A.’s 6-1 record in close games last year and favorable bounces in recovering fumbles, to a more difficult schedule and even the possibility of adverse effects due to more injuries. Elo thinks the Rams’ point differential will drop from +143 to +58 this season. Behind them, the Seahawks have the division’s best (slash only above-average) Elo QB in Russell Wilson, and they did some offseason shuffling — Clowney and Ziggy Ansah will replace Frank Clark on the pass rush, for example. But Seattle mostly looks like the same good-but-not-great team it was last season. The 49ers will get a do-over with Jimmy Garoppolo after the QB was injured three games into the 2018 season. But is Jimmy G. any good? Elo’s still not sure. It ranks Garoppolo 22nd among starters heading into 2019, despite his hefty price tag. All three of those teams could potentially contend for the division, though. For the Cardinals, that looks like a long shot at best with the tandem of rookie QB Kyler Murray and first-year head coach Kliff Kingsbury. Elo gives Arizona the worst rating and tied for the lowest playoff odds of any team in the NFL this season.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

So Why Don’t The Stats Agree?,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"In the wake of Justin Verlander throwing his third career no-hitter on Sunday — becoming just the sixth pitcher in major league history to do so — the debate didn’t seem to be whether the Astros ace was worthy of the Hall of Fame, but rather what cap he would wear in it.1 Even Major League Baseball’s official Twitter account called it “ANOTHER line on Justin Verlander’s Hall of Fame résumé.” But are we all being a bit too hasty?
By at least one smart measure of Hall-worthiness, Verlander is not yet deserving of a berth in Cooperstown. Cited by many sabermetrically-inclined voters, Jaffe Wins Above Replacement Score, or JAWS, is the average of a player’s career wins above replacement2 and his WAR over his seven best seasons (“peak WAR”). To determine if a player belongs in the Hall, a player’s JAWS is compared with the average JAWS of existing Hall of Famers at his position (because it’s easier to accrue value at, say, starting pitcher than at catcher). If the player’s JAWS is higher, the system recommends a yes vote; if the Hall of Famers’ JAWS is higher, the player falls short. Although JAWS is an imperfect yardstick (for example, it doesn’t include postseason stats, nor does it account for unique accomplishments like, say, pitching three no-hitters), electing only people above its positional standards ensures that the quality of Hall of Fame players does not decrease.
With a JAWS of 59.0 so far in his career, Verlander remains below the JAWS average for starting pitchers of 61.5. But he’s not alone. No active starting pitcher meets the JAWS standard (although some may do so by the time they retire). In fact, neither does any starter who has thrown a single pitch this entire decade. That suggests a problem not with Verlander or other modern pitchers, but with the standard. Simply put, it’s too high given the usage patterns of today’s starting pitchers.3
As pitch counts and bullpens have become bigger parts of the game, we’ve gone from 1,034 complete games pitched in the 1978 season to 266 in 1997 to just 42 last year. From 1871 to 1953, a period that includes at least part of the careers of about two-thirds of Hall of Fame starting pitchers, starters accounted for more than 80 percent of all innings pitched every season. In 2018, that share was 60 percent. It’s simply not fair to compare starting pitchers of the past few decades — let alone of the past few years, a period when “bullpenning” has exploded in popularity — with bygone Hall of Famers who regularly exceeded 300 innings pitched in a year.
What we can do instead is sketch out a new standard, based on the premise that the Hall of Fame should immortalize the greatest starting pitchers of each era, even if those eras are not directly comparable. Verlander’s numbers may not be able to hold a candle to those of, say, the deadball era, but he deserves recognition as an elite hurler in the context of our current era, the bullpen-happy 2010s. The average season from 1901 to 20044 had 10 active starting pitchers who were eventually elected to Cooperstown, so we can maintain the Hall’s relative historical standards by electing the top 10 best starting pitchers in the game today. By JAWS, those are:

Even though none of them yet measures up to the traditional JAWS standard, it’s clear that the likes of Zack Greinke, Clayton Kershaw and Verlander should be Hall of Famers by this method. But the No. 10 pitcher on the list, Adam Wainwright, is probably not a Hall of Famer — and his 36.7 JAWS likely shouldn’t be used as the new standard. That’s because young studs like Aaron Nola (20.2 JAWS at age 26) are still racking up stats and could eventually displace the bottom several names on the list. So let’s try looking at the version of this list from, say, 2012. That’s long enough ago that the list is closer to being final, but it’s recent enough that it reflects the context of how starting pitchers were deployed during Verlander’s career (in fact, as of 2019, 2012 is the exact midpoint of his MLB career).

A few names might change on this list, albeit somewhat predictably. It would be surprising if Chris Sale (42.3 JAWS at age 30) didn’t crack it. Madison Bumgarner (33.6 JAWS at age 30) and Stephen Strasburg (30.8 JAWS at age 31) are young enough that they could get there in time as well. Félix Hernández (44.6 JAWS at age 33) and Jon Lester (40.3 JAWS at age 35) are close but may be running out of gas. In all likelihood, though, the first several names on this list are safe — which would mean that we know the JAWS threshold for cracking the top 10. Essentially, it looks like amassing around 50 JAWS for your career is enough to guarantee your place as one of the top 10 starting pitchers of the early 2010s. And, if the trend of increased bullpen usage of the past few years continues through the next decade, the standard for the early 2020s may be even lower.
This revision has a couple of implications for Hall of Fame selection that voters should heed before it’s too late. First, despite falling well short of historical standards, candidates like Johan Santana (who received very little support on the one Hall of Fame ballot he appeared on, despite currently being the eighth-best starter active in 2012) deserve closer looks, as they were elite for their era. Second, yes — Justin Verlander is a no-doubt Hall of Famer. Hopefully, by the time he is up for a vote in the 2020s, voters will opt to view his JAWS as dominant among his peers, rather than mediocre within the Hall.

175 miles of border fencing
It’s safe to say that President Trump’s original plan to fund a border wall — get Mexico to pay for it — is on hold indefinitely. Enter the U.S. military to help out. The Pentagon is diverting $3.6 billion meant for other military construction projects to build part of the barrier. The change will halt approximately 127 military projects in order to construct 175 miles of border fencing. Trump’s proposed wall is roughly 1,000 miles so … we’ve got a long road ahead. [AP, New York Times]
$170 million
Google will pay big to settle a YouTube lawsuit. The tech giant has agreed to pay $170 million following allegations by the Federal Trade Commission and New York state that YouTube illegally collected user information from children to sell for targeted advertisements. The FTC’s part of the settlement, $136 million, is the largest fine paid for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. [CNN]
1 state
Michigan teens: Say goodbye to your peach-flavored nicotine. In an effort to curb underage vaping, Michigan became the first U.S. state to ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes. The vaping craze has led to reports of illnesses around the country. “I am committed to protecting public health,” wrote Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in a letter to state senators. “There is no doubt that keeping nicotine out of the hands of kids is one of the most powerful ways to fulfill that commitment.” [NBC News]
$54,000 in fines
Oakland Raiders wide receiver Antonio Brown faces a pricey penalty for reportedly missing training camp and a walkthrough. In an Instagram story, Brown posted an image of a letter from the team detailing the fines, which amount to nearly $54,000. This is just the latest dust-up in a tumultuous offseason for Brown, which has included a fight with the NFL over his game helmet and reporting to the Raiders training camp with frostbitten feet. Ouch. [The Washington Post]
Two minutes of prayer
The mind is a powerful thing, as they say. For Marianne Williamson, it’s strong enough to control hurricanes. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate deleted a tweet Wednesday suggesting that people can protect the U.S. from Hurricane Dorian with “two minutes of prayer, visualization, meditation.” She later replaced the tweet by simply calling for “prayers for the people of the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas.” [Yahoo]
5 Texas House Republicans
More House Republicans are checking out. Texas Rep. Bill Flores announced Wednesday that he will not seek reelection in 2020, becoming the state’s fifth House Republican to announce plans to retire. Nationally, 15 House Republicans have made similar announcements. As GOP lawmakers flee, Democrats hope to use the state’s changing demographics to move in on the open seats. [The New York Times]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-let-crowd-sizes-mislead-you/,2019-09-05,,,features,"Sep. 5, 2019",Don’t Let Crowd Sizes Mislead You,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign has said she has drawn crowds of up to 15,000. Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden has not exactly been packing them in, even as he continues to lead by a healthy margin in most polls of the Democratic presidential primary. So could Warren’s big crowds be picking up on something that the polls are missing?
The short answer is: No. While the ability to generate big crowds is certainly nice — it may signal enthusiasm among highly engaged voters or produce favorable media coverage — you should ignore any candidate, surrogate or media outlet that tells you that large crowd sizes mean that the polls are underestimating a candidate’s support. It’s just spin; polls are much more accurate at forecasting elections than crowd-size estimates, which don’t tell us all that much.
For every example like 2008, when then-Sen. Barack Obama’s huge crowds seemed to reflect real enthusiasm for his campaign, there is one like 2012, when former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney won his primary despite drawing noticeably small crowds on the campaign trail. Or take what happened in 2016. Despite a lot of hay being made about crowd sizes during the 2016 campaign, that cycle also was an argument against crowd sizes being predictive. Although now-President Trump did often draw large crowds at his primary rallies, Hillary Clinton reportedly beat him out for largest crowd of the 2016 campaign, 40,000 to 30,000. And at roughly this point in the Democratic primary in 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders was outdrawing Clinton!
One of the many problems with crowd-size estimates is that they can be extremely rough, and they’re subject to reporting bias. (If Warren says she drew 10,000 people to a college campus, but the university says the crowd was only 5,000, whom would you believe?) There are also a ton of factors other than enthusiasm for the candidate that can affect crowd sizes: Where is the event being held? (Is it in New York City, or in a small town in Iowa?) How frequently does the candidate hold events? (If candidates are frequent visitors to an area, there is perhaps less urgency for voters to attend any one rally.) Are there other draws besides the candidate? (For example, that Clinton rally that drew 40,000 also featured performances by Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi.)
Like Google search data, crowd sizes may also be more of a measure of curiosity about a candidate than actual support. Voters don’t just go to rallies to cheer on their candidate; they also go to learn more and maybe allow themselves to be persuaded. In the 2020 primary, it would therefore make sense that known commodities like Biden might get smaller crowds, while novelties like Warren might get bigger ones.
And like small donors, the people who attend campaign events may skew toward a certain demographic — disproportionately upper-income, well-educated and white. For instance, those who have the time and financial flexibility to attend a campaign event are probably relatively affluent. And according to a 2018 poll from the Pew Research Center, 35 percent of people with college degrees, and 41 percent of those with postgraduate degrees, said they had attended a political rally or event in the past five years; only 20 percent of those with no college education said they had. Liberal Democrats were also much more likely than moderate or conservative Democrats to have attended a campaign event. And given that many political events are held in the evening, that might preclude a lot of people who work evening shifts, who are disproportionately black, Hispanic or low-income, from attending too.
In other words, crowds at political events are self-selected. By contrast, polls are scientific instruments that use proven sampling techniques and statistical weighting to ensure that they are reflecting a representative population. As such, the former should never outweigh the latter, or else you’ll end up overestimating the standing of plugged-in whites’ preferred candidate.
And this actually might go a long way toward explaining the difference between Warren’s massive mobs and Biden’s smaller crowds. Polls say Warren performs especially well among college-educated, white, liberal voters, while Biden’s support is largely concentrated among groups that might not show up at rallies as often — black voters, moderates and working-class voters. So the next time you see a story about crowd size in the Democratic primary, remember that crowd sizes can mislead you if you let them. Don’t let them.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

She Keeps Beating Them.,Tom Perrotta,FiveThirtyEight,Tennis,"Serena Williams needs just two more wins in this year’s U.S. Open to tie Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 Grand Slam titles. The record would be impressive on its own, but it’s even more notable for the strength of her opposition: Williams has faced the best in the game, over and over, in the 20 years since she won her first major.
The 37-year-old captured her first major title at the U.S. Open on Sept. 11, 1999, beating Martina Hingis. Since then, 58 different players have ascended to the top 10, according to the WTA, and Serena has played 55 of them. She’s also played almost all of the women who have made it into the top 5 since her first title, facing 36 of the 37. And more of Williams’s opponents are likely to make their top 10 debuts soon: Bianca Andreescu, whom she faced in Toronto last month, is ranked 15th and could reach the top 10 for the first time after she won Wednesday in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open.
Some of her former adversaries — players who made it atop the rankings in the past 20 years — have already retired, while Williams continues to compete for major titles. Justine Henin, who is 6-8 all-time against Williams, retired in 2008, staged a comeback in 2010 and left the game for good in 2011. Kim Clijsters, who was 2-7 against Williams, retired in 2012.
Somehow, Williams has continued to evolve despite facing a seemingly endless parade of young talent.
“I think the sport has come a really long way,” Williams said in her post-match press conference on Tuesday. “It’s the best work in the world that a woman can do in my mind.”
Serena’s staying power has been a thing of beauty. From 1999 to 2010, she won 13 major titles. She struggled in 2011 and early in 2012, missing large swaths of time with a foot injury and blood clots in her lungs. But after she started working with Patrick Mouratoglou in 2012, reworking some of her approach to the game and recovering from the injuries, Williams reversed her decline and played her best tennis yet. From 2012 to 2017, she won 10 Slams, an improbable count for her age. And, of course, Williams took a year off from the sport around the birth of her daughter in September 2017, skipping four straight Slams until last year’s French Open.
At the U.S. Open, she is close to another record. After beating Wang Qiang 6-1, 6-0 on Tuesday, Williams now has 100 match wins at the U.S. Open. If she wins the tournament without an opponent withdrawal, she will pass Chris Evert, who won 101 matches in her U.S. Open career.
Even among her historic achievements, a record 24th major victory for Serena will be on the minds of observers on Saturday. Since her last Slam victory in 2017, Williams has come close to the mark, reaching three finals in the past two years. Tonight, she will battle Elina Svitolina, who has beaten Williams once, at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Svitolina hasn’t lost a set at the Open and has looked formidable. Still, Williams has a great opportunity this week to finally tie Court’s record, as none of the three other women left in the U.S. Open — Svitolina, Andreescu and Belinda Bencic — has ever won a major.
“It feels good,” Williams said. “This is what I’ve been training for.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-views-of-the-economy-are-partisan-but-theyre-not-immune-to-bad-news/,2019-09-05,,,features,"Sep. 6, 2019","Americans’ Views Of The Economy Are Partisan, But They’re Not Immune To Bad News",Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.
Poll of the week
“How is the economy doing?” is a question that we have several hard, objective metrics with which to answer. But increasingly, how Americans think the economy is doing seems to depend on their party. But just because views of the economy are polarized, that doesn’t mean they’re stagnant — and that could prove pivotal for President Trump in 2020.
Quinnipiac University’s latest national poll of registered voters, conducted Aug. 21-26, found a huge gap between how Republicans and Democrats perceive the state of the economy: 43 percent of Republicans described it as “excellent,” and another 45 percent described it as “good”; among Democrats, however, just 2 percent described the state of the economy as “excellent” and 37 percent said it was “good.” A plurality of Democrats, 43 percent, thought it was “not so good,” while 17 percent called it “poor.”
In total, 88 percent of Republicans used a positive adjective for the state of the economy, while only 39 percent of Democrats did the same. That 49-point gap in how the two parties perceived the strength of the economy was the second-largest that Quinnipiac has measured in the last three years.1 (The largest gap came this January, amid the government shutdown.)
Granted, it’s not unusual for voters’ politics to color their perceptions of the economy. During the Obama administration, Democrats were generally more optimistic about the economy than Republicans were; that flipped a few months into Trump’s tenure. Since then, Republicans have consistently viewed the economy more positively than Democrats have, but as the chart above shows, the gap between parties has really widened over time.
Most of this is due to Republicans warming to the economy, going from having a slight majority with positive views at the beginning of the Trump administration to near-universal approval today. Under the surface, Republicans haven’t just gotten more likely to feel positively about the economy, they’ve also been reporting more strongly positive feelings. As late as April 2018, only 18 percent of Republicans said the state of the economy was “excellent” and 65 percent said it was “good.” In May 2019, 50 percent rated it “excellent” and 42 percent rated it “good.” That said, a bit of that enthusiasm did wear off in the latest poll, when the “excellent” number dropped by a few points. This could be the result of heightened anxiety that a recession might be around the corner.
But while Republicans’ views on the economy have largely been on a steady march upward, Democrats’ views appear to be more sensitive to events. In February 2018, after Trump’s first State of the Union address and a strong month in the stock market, 62 percent of Democrats had a positive view of the economy, but at moments like the January 2019 government shutdown or this most recent poll, positive views of the economy among Democrats have dipped to as low as 39 percent. But electorally, Republicans’ and Democrats’ views on the economy may not matter all that much; their 2020 votes are largely already set in stone.
So what’s perhaps more troubling for Trump is that independents’ opinions on the economy look a lot like Democrats’ — they often react to current events in a similar way, though their recent baseline is about 20 points higher. While it’s plausible that partisan polarization is so strong these days that even a recession would not change many voters’ minds about Trump, the fact that independents appear persuadable on the economy is a point in favor of the theory that a recession would indeed damage his reelection chances.
Indeed, it might be a coincidence that Trump’s overall approval rating has ticked down in recent weeks amid speculation about a looming recession, but it also comes at a time when only 57 percent of independents have kind things to say about the state of the economy — the lowest number Quinnipiac has found since the summer of 2017.
Other polling bites
As long as we’re on the topic of partisan gaps, there is also one on whether the U.S. should spend more money for scientific research. According to the Pew Research Center, 62 percent of Democrats and people who lean Democratic would increase federal spending on scientific research, but only 40 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents agreed. That said, that’s still more support among both parties than Pew previously found in almost two decades of polling.
Marquette University Law School — one of the best pollsters in a crucial swing state — released its latest poll of Wisconsin this week, and residents gave Trump a 45 percent approval rating and a 53 percent disapproval rating. Interestingly, 37 percent of Wisconsinites said they thought the economy has gotten better over the last year, and 25 percent said they thought it had gotten worse — but when asked how they thought the economy would change in the next year, the results were reversed. Just 26 percent thought things would get better, and 37 percent thought they would get worse.
Tune in next week for a full preview of the upcoming do-over election in the North Carolina 9th Congressional District, but don’t overlook the special election in the North Carolina 3rd District that’s happening at the same time. That race has gotten less attention, but this week the Republican blog RRH Elections released a poll of that race that gave GOP state Rep. Greg Murphy a 51-40 lead over Democrat Allen Thomas in this bright-red district. (According to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric,2 it’s 24 points more Republican-leaning than the nation as a whole.)
Just in time for CNN’s climate town halls with the Democratic presidential candidates, the Sierra Club and Morning Consult released a poll of “climate voters” — those who say that the candidates’ climate plans are “very important” to their vote. And the results looked a lot like polls of the Democratic field overall, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 30 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 21 percent and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 20 percent.
Turmoil on the Thames! Opponents of a no-deal Brexit successfully took control of the parliamentary agenda away from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and advanced a bill to prevent the United Kingdom from exiting the European Union without an agreement in place. In response, Johnson wants to call a new parliamentary election, and British voters tilt slightly in his favor. A YouGov poll says 41 percent of Britons want their member of Parliament to vote to hold a new election in mid-October, and 31 percent want their MP to vote against such a measure.
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 41.4 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.9 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -12.5 points). At this time last week, 41.3 percent approved and 54.2 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -12.9 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 42.4 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.2 percent, for a net approval rating of -10.8 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.5 percentage points (46.3 percent to 39.8 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 6.7 points (46.4 percent to 39.7 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.1 points (46.1 percent to 40.0 percent).

So Sylvia Fowles Adapted Her Game.,Howard Megdal,FiveThirtyEight,WNBA,"It’s a tough season to be a center in the WNBA.
Foul calls are down significantly, dropping by 1.4 fouls per game from 2018. But the “big” bigs — the best fives the league has to offer — have been hit especially hard. Through 32 games, the number of free-throw attempts by Liz Cambage of the Las Vegas Aces, Brittney Griner of the Phoenix Mercury and Sylvia Fowles of the Minnesota Lynx is down 37 percent.
The results have been evident. Griner, tired of taking so much uncalled contact, was involved in an altercation last month that resulted in a three-game suspension. Cambage described it, in an interview earlier this summer, this way: “I don’t really see myself playing into my 30s because I don’t want to go to war.” Cambage is still having an elite season, but her overall production is down from last year — her field-goal percentage has fallen from 58.9 to 49.3 percent while her true shooting percentage has dropped from 64.3 to 55.2 percent.
But Fowles, through a combination of inter- and intraseason adaptations, has kept her production remarkably consistent. Her career field-goal percentage is 59.3 percent. This season, her field-goal percentage is … 59.1 percent.
Another year, same Syl. At age 33, Fowles is this generation’s greatest center, trailing only Lauren Jackson among centers in career Win Shares, but she doesn’t get enough appreciation, to hear her coach and teammates tell it.
“Syl reminds me of myself, like no one recognizes her greatness,” said Fowles’s current Lynx and former LSU teammate Seimone Augustus. “But she continues to just get better, year after year. I mean, at the end of the day, when it’s all said and done and she retires, I think people are going to look back and go, ‘Wow.’”
By the catch-all stat Win Shares, Fowles has quietly amassed more value than anyone else in the WNBA over the past three seasons. Elena Delle Donne, Griner and Cambage may get more headlines, but only Fowles has more than 20 win shares since the start of the 2017 season. No one else has cracked 19.
But while the statistics — at least the topline numbers — would indicate that Fowles is simply the same great center she’s been since her rookie season in Chicago back in 2008, a closer look at how she’s been scoring her points in 2019 reveals the change she made to enhance her game.
Fowles is 19-for-34 on shots 15 to 19 feet away from the basket, a 55.9 percent clip that ranks her among this season’s elite midrange shooters. For reference, Fowles was 2-for-6 from that distance in 2018.
That didn’t happen by accident. Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve told Fowles in their exit meeting at the end of 2018 that she wanted her to diversify her game, and Fowles worked with Lynx assistant Walt Hopkins all offseason. The daily routine was punishing: Fowles would shoot at the rim, in the paint, from the free-throw and three-point lines, and couldn’t advance to the next spot until she made five in a row, all swishes.
Her success this season from all over the court has actually helped Fowles focus on her original strength — that endless array of post moves — and not settle for the jumpers she’s now sinking routinely.
“I have to make sure it doesn’t take away what I do best,” Fowles said. “I have to make sure I don’t get too relaxed and shoot jumpers. When I’m open, I shoot. But when I’m not, it’s making sure I do what I used to do, and that’s going to the rim.”
But even Fowles acknowledged a frustration with how much harder it has been to earn foul-line trips through contact. Fowles has gotten more than four free-throw attempts in a game just six times all season. In 2018, she shot more than four free throw attempts in 17 of 34 games.
I asked Sue Blauch, the WNBA’s head of referee performance and development, about the reduction in both free-throw attempts originating out of the paint and player frustration with it. She acknowledged the decrease in offensive efficiency in the league this season and said “everyone should dig deep and explore” what might be the cause. “We certainly looked at our play-calling data and have addressed any contribution that officiating may have had,” she said.
Refs across the WNBA did seem to take note of recent league office guidance. Before July’s All-Star break, the average number of fouls per game was 33.2. Since then, fouls are up to 37.3 per game — an increase of 12.3 percent. That shift toward more fouls in the paint required another adjustment for Fowles, who was sent to the bench early in several games with foul trouble herself.
“Now everything’s a foul fest, the last couple of games it’s a foul fest, we have to adjust to that,” Reeve said after a Minnesota win in New York on Aug. 13. “All of a sudden there’s an about-face about how it’s being officiated. And so I told Syl, I said, ‘No complaints now. You know, you gotta get yourself to the foul line.’ Some of it is being patient and not racing through the move, give a defender a chance to foul you, type of thing. So I think she’s got to be a little more poised in the post.”
It isn’t easy. Fowles said she huddled with Cambage and Griner during All-Star weekend in Las Vegas about how to handle all the physical abuse. She laughed when asked if she meditates.
“Oh, yes,” Fowles said. “I meditate. I talk to therapists. It gets frustrating.” But she doesn’t want to talk about it with her teammates and coaches, to “put out that negative energy.” Instead, she just continues to be Sylvia Fowles.
In the three games after that Aug. 13 win, she shot 63.6 percent. She took only one shot from the 15-to-19-foot range. And in her past four games, she’s shot 59.5 percent, going 4-of-7 when 15 to 19 feet from the basket.
The rules change, the teams change, the players change. But Sylvia Fowles keeps on doing what she does.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Last season, the Chicago Bears were initially forecast for seven wins by Las Vegas, then traded for Khalil Mack and somehow won 12. The Green Bay Packers’s predicted win total was 10, but they melted down in spectacular fashion and ultimately ended up winning just six games.
We’ve already published our Elo projections, and we think they’re the best we’ve ever produced for the NFL, but there will still be lots of misses to grouse about come January. Forecasting a sport as luck-driven as the NFL is rough that way.
It raises the question: How good are betting markets at predicting team wins? To find out, I got my hands on a tranche of win prediction data stretching back to 1989, courtesy of Sports Odds History, and checked how well Vegas preseason win totals predict actual team wins. While Vegas overall does a good job identifying good and bad teams, it turns out that at the lower end of the range of projected wins, Vegas predictions don’t seem particularly well calibrated — though the confidence intervals at the lower end are large because of the small sample size, so the results aren’t statistically significant.
Projected win totals of six and fewer undersell teams’ prospects by about a win on average, with the exception of teams forecast for five wins.
Win totals don’t change as frequently as the moneyline odds, so we probably shouldn’t take win totals at face value — at least for teams with low projected wins. What does this mean for non-bettors? It should be decent news for the Cincinnati Bengals, New York Giants, Oakland Raiders and Washington Redskins — teams that both Elo and Vegas have pegged for six wins in 2019 — since we should be more bullish on their chances than we currently are.
Optimism for these probable cellar dwellers might feel forced. But we should fight the urge toward overconfidence, especially in the face of history. A few of these teams will end up surprising us — in a good way — at the end of the year for reasons inscrutable to us now.

Well … maybe not the Bengals. Not only is Cincinnati saddled with an injured A.J. Green, who appears to be out until around Week 8, the Bengals have an offense that is bereft of top talent at nearly every position. Cincinnati replaced head coach Marvin Lewis after 16 seasons of on-again, off-again contention and turned instead to Zac Taylor, a coach best known for being friends with L.A. Rams wunderkind Sean McVay. The hope must be that Taylor can revitalize the career of quarterback Andy Dalton, who sports a middling career yards per attempt of 7.2 and is one of the few starting quarterbacks who Vegas believes wouldn’t move a line if he were to be replaced in the lineup. The defense doesn’t offer a compelling reason for optimism: The Bengals ranked 28th in defensive Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) last season. Perhaps we should view that as a reason to be bullish on their prospects in 2019 simply due to regression, since defensive performance year to year isn’t terribly stable. If that seems like a bridge too far, magic might be the answer: Taylor may give lip service to the notion that he isn’t trying to be like his mentor McVay, but McVay’s brand of QB sorcery seems like the best hope for the Bengals to crest seven wins this year.
The Giants are more interesting. After a promising preseason performance by first-round pick Daniel Jones, New York fans are clamoring for a change of the guard at quarterback. As big of a reach as many believed Jones to be, I still see him as a better use of first-round draft capital than “generational talent” Saquon Barkley. Hailed as a potential savior and the missing piece for Eli Manning’s final championship push, Barkley helped the Giants improve from a terrible three-win team in 2017 to a merely bad five-win unit in 2018.
The Giants were second-worst in the league on Expected Points Added per play on first-down play-action passes after adding Saquon to the backfield,1 and prospects for a bounceback in play-action efficiency seem bleak. After trading all-world wideout Odell Beckham Jr. to the Browns, the Giants lost free agent acquisition Golden Tate to a four-game suspension for performance-enhancing drugs and their expected No. 3 wideout Corey Coleman to a season-ending ACL injury. Their best hope for a productive season may rest in ownership’s willingness to bench Manning for good this time.
The other team to somehow accumulate negative value on first-down play action was Oakland. In what seems to be a pattern for teams at the bottom of the win total forecast, Vegas sees Derek Carr as a quarterback worth just 1 point to the spread. The stats back up that view. Carr’s career yards per attempt is, at 6.7, below league average, and his best season as judged by QBR is an anemic 54.6. His weapons are improved from a year ago, but they are volatile. New Raiders wideout Antonio Brown sat out of practice because he wasn’t allowed to wear a helmet the NFL deems dangerous and is now likely to be suspended for some period of time, and Tyrell Williams is a boom or bust weapon who likes to be targeted deep — something Carr may be reluctant to do given his career average depth of target of just 7.7 yards. Meanwhile “Hard Knocks” captured head coach Jon Gruden disparaging “all the football stats and all the fantasy bullshit” in favor of running backs that will “BOOF” the opposing team in pass protection. Of all the six-win teams, Oakland may be the most unpredictable — and that unpredictability could manifest itself in good ways, as well as bad. Brown’s antics could end with a fashionable and safe new helmet, Carr might be coaxed into throwing the deep ball to a talented field stretcher, and Gruden might use rookie running back Josh Jacobs optimally, leading to wins we simply can’t foresee at this point.
The final team projected for six wins in 2019 is Washington, a team that somehow came to the determination that Mark Sanchez and Josh Johnson were better choices than Colin Kaepernick to take over for quarterback Alex Smith when his 2018 season — and perhaps his career — ended with a gruesome leg injury.
In the draft, Washington team president Bruce Allen added Ohio State QB Dwayne Haskins in the first round but then failed to surround him with receiving weapons. Jamison Crowder left via free agency, former first-round bust Josh Doctson was released at the end of the preseason and tight end Jordan Reed suffered another concussion heading into Week 1. Their current starting wide receivers are third-round pick Terry McLaurin — also from Ohio State — and Paul Richardson.
The outlook at running back is brighter with the return of Derrius Guice from an ACL tear that derailed his rookie season, but there is little evidence to suggest they will put him in advantageous spots to run the ball. With the ageless, tackle-breaking cyborg Adrian Peterson in 2018, Washington lined up against neutral or stacked boxes on first-and-10 or second and long 174 times, decided they liked the look and ran right into the scrum 72 percent of the time. But if Washington can flip the script on downs tailor-made for passing and eke out some yards where they should come easy, the duo of Guice and Peterson could be enough to protect current starter Case Keenum or rookie Haskins while he learns on the job — and possibly beat the team’s six-win projection.

18 hours stationary
Hurricane Dorian is now moving northward as a Category 2 storm with sustained winds of just over 100 m.p.h. That’s considerably weaker than when Dorian arrived as the most powerful Atlantic hurricane (by sustained wind speed) to make landfall. It’s also at least moving now — Dorian slowed to nearly a complete stop Monday through Tuesday morning, barely budging over an 18-hour span as it pummeled the Bahamas. In the past 70 years, only Hurricane Betsy in 1965 moved less over a 24-hour span. [ABC News, National Hurricane Center]
200 knuckleballs
The knuckleball pitcher appears to be on the decline — just 200 of the unpredictable pitches have been thrown in MLB this season. However, “The Knuckleball Isn’t Dead Yet” proclaims Ben Lindbergh of The Ringer. Just enough knuckleballers (two to three) exist around the fringes of the major leagues to impart their knowledge to the next generation (as the “knuckler code” apparently dictates). Hopefully, that will ensure the pitch’s survival. [The Ringer]
1 vote
British MP Phillip Lee defected from the Conservative Party to the Liberal Democrats on Tuesday, costing Prime Minister Boris Johnson his one-seat majority in Parliament. Next, a potential vote on Wednesday will attempt to shift control of the Commons. There also could be an election on Oct. 14, should Johnson call for one, just two weeks ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. It’s all very confusing. But, to be clear, the BBC says that the vote on Wednesday “will give [MPs hoping to block no deal] the chance to introduce a cross-party bill which would force the prime minister to ask for Brexit to be delayed until 31 January, unless MPs approve a new deal, or vote in favour of a no-deal exit, by 19 October.” Got that? [BBC]
2 free throws
Khris Middleton sealed a victory for Team USA in the group stage of the FIBA Basketball World Cup on Tuesday by sinking two free throws with two seconds left in overtime. That was after teammate Jayson Tatum forced overtime by making two of three foul shots with 0.1 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Still, a game this close against Turkey, the 17th-ranked nation, is a troubling sign for the Americans. Should the U.S. defeat Japan on Thursday, they’d advance to the second round, where they may have to face a Greece team featuring NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. If the U.S. doesn’t win gold, expect another “redeem team” for next year’s Olympics. [ESPN]
$90 million
Running-back Ezekiel Elliott appears to have agreed to a six-year, $90 million extension with the Dallas Cowboys. The deal gives him a massive raise over his previous rookie contract and would end Zeke’s month-long holdout just five days before his team’s first game. Elliott would become the highest-paid running back in football, surpassing Todd Gurley. [ESPN, Pro Football Talk]
26 licensing deals
With their lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation over equal pay ongoing, the U.S. women’s national team has found other ways to profit from their fame and success. The USWNT Players Association projects to make over $1 million through licensing deals, including Wheaties boxes, t-shirts and bobbleheads, despite being told during collective bargaining negotiations that their image had no value. I did not know an Alex Morgan sipping tea bobblehead existed, and now I need one. [Yahoo Sports]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-virtual-iowa-caucus-would-have-been-a-hacking-nightmare/,2019-09-04,,,features,"Sep. 4, 2019",A Virtual Iowa Caucus Would Have Been A Hacking Nightmare,Maggie Koerth,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"When the Democratic National Committee put the kibosh on plans for virtual caucuses in Iowa and Nevada, they may have pissed off the people who saw the event as a chance to give more people the opportunity to vote. But at least the DNC made the cybersecurity community happy.
“It was absolutely the right decision,” said Herb Lin, senior research scholar at Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation.
Lin and other experts praised the DNC for deciding the risks of a virtual caucus outweighed the benefits of making the time-consuming and byzantine caucus system more accessible. Yes, that has thrown state parties into a bit of chaos as they scramble to come up with new plans by a Sept. 13 deadline. But, Lin and others told me, there’s no getting around the fact that a virtual caucus would be massively hackable — easy to steal, and even easier to simply disrupt. If anything, they said, they wished more political leaders would take the same stance against such schemes, both in the U.S. and abroad.
Participating in the Iowa caucus is an epic event. If you want to vote, you have to show up in person, on a frigid February weeknight, for meetings that can end up lasting hours. So the DNC set up rules for the 2020 primary that encourage states to shift away from caucuses and toward a more common ballot vote. Part of this move means states have to offer some form of absentee voting, too. In Iowa, polling had suggested an absentee option for the caucus could increase participation by nearly a third. In response, the Democratic party in Iowa proposed a plan that would allow people to register their preferences ahead of the actual caucus night. It’s not totally clear how this plan would have worked, but the Des Moines Register reported it would have involved a combination of an online registration system and a dial-in phone number for the actual vote.
But that would be a really, really, really, really bad idea, said Bruce Schneier, a security technologist and fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. “It would be insane to do it and expect it to be secure,” he told me. Schneier and other security experts said voting systems like the one Iowa proposed are significantly more risky than the electronic voting machines or ballot readers that are already commonly used — and commonly cited as security risks. It is basically impossible, they told me, to set up a voting system that involves phones and the internet without it becoming a threat to the integrity of the election.
There are a myriad number of ways a phone or online voting system could be compromised. Some are simple, relying on technology that is, itself, nearly old enough to run for president. “To do a phone option, you need a phone number to call into,” Lin said. “I can easily imagine, with the tech not of today, but 30 years ago, setting up a bunch of computers to call that number and jam it so they always get a busy signal.” That denial of service attack wouldn’t hack the vote, exactly, but it would affect the outcome by preventing people from actually participating.
To see how a more complex hack could unfold, you merely need to look to the results of 2010 security test of Washington, D.C.’s online voting pilot project, said Susan Greenhalgh, a vice president at the National Election Defense Coalition. Developed to allow overseas voters to cast their ballots remotely, the webapp-based voting system turned out to be wildly insecure. Exploiting what amounted to a trivial typo in the code, security experts were able to alter the outcomes of both past elections and any that might happen in the future. They were also able to reveal information about voters and hide evidence of the intrusion from the people running the system. It took 36 hours before anyone noticed something had gone wrong.
And while you might be able to fix a coding error here or spackle on a patch there, it’s hard to escape fundamental disconnects between the needs of an election and the needs of cybersecurity, Schneier said.
“People often ask me how come you can bank online, but not vote,” he said. The answer comes down to the concept of the secret ballot. Online banking works because, when security breaches happen, it’s possible to see what went wrong and fix it. Your debit card number gets stolen, but you quickly realize what happened and inform the bank, and they can figure out which transactions you are and aren’t your responsibility.
That’s not true for online voting, where it’s vitally important that the people in charge not know who cast a ballot for which candidate. That anonymity — and the lack of a paper proof to check the vote against — means votes can get changed and no one would know, or be able to switch them back if they did. Even blockchain — a cryptography technology that would make votes difficult to change on the sly and has been proposed as a solution for online voting security by presidential candidate Andrew Yang — still leaves plenty of room for failure. All someone would have to do is vote posing as you, using your login credentials. And if fraud were suspected, there’d be no way to recount.
And yet, many countries remain interested in dipping their toes in the online voting tide. Switzerland has tried a number of different pilot programs since 2004 — one of which was found to contain critical, potentially vote-altering flaws just this past March. Estonia introduced online voting in 2005 and it now accounts for as many as one quarter of all votes cast in that country. But while news headlines tout the country’s voting system as the future of elections, experts have found serious flaws in its security. And even after those vulnerabilities were fixed, Greenhalgh told me, new ones have emerged. All it takes is one thing to go wrong and the entire system collapses, she said.
Meanwhile, 32 states in the U.S. offer some kind of online voting, either through an internet portal or over email. While primarily aimed at active-duty service members or voters living overseas, online ballots accounted for about 100,000 votes cast in the 2016 presidential election. And only two states, Alaska and Washington, took steps to roll back online voting after it became clear how seriously foreign governments were targeting U.S. election technology, Greenhalgh said.
So seeing the DNC take the threat seriously was a relief to people like Greenhalgh because it looks like, for once, a national political entity really understands what’s at stake. “We aren’t seeing any leadership [on this] in the federal government,” she told me.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-smiling-really-make-you-happier/,2019-09-04,,,features,"Sep. 5, 2019",Can Smiling Really Make You Happier?,Cathleen O'Grady,FiveThirtyEight,Meta-Science,"Before we get started, do me a favor and grab a pen or a pencil. Now hold it between your teeth, as if you were about to try to write with it. Don’t let your lips touch it. Sit with it, and pay attention to how you feel. Are you glum? Cheerful? Confused? Is that any different than how you felt before? Do you feel like this weird smile tricked your brain into a slight jump in happiness?
For a long time, psychologists thought exercises like this one did make us happier. If that were true, it would have implications for what emotion is, how we experience it and where emotions come from. Psychologists have believed that “facial feedback” from emotional expressions like smiling (or frowning) gives the brain information that heightens, or even sparks, an emotional experience.
It made so much sense that it was almost too good to check.
But then scientists did check. What they found poked holes in one of psychology’s textbook findings — which raised a whole new set of questions. Now, a huge group of scientists has banded together to try to get to the bottom of smiles, even if it means working with people who think they’re wrong.
The idea that smiling can make you feel happier has a long history. In 1872, Darwin mused about whether an emotion that was expressed would be felt more intensely than one that was repressed. Early psychologists were musing about it in the 1880s. More than a hundred studies have been published on the topic. And it’s a trope of pop wisdom: “Smile, though your heart is aching,” sang Nat King Cole in 1954. “You’ll find that life is still worthwhile, if you’ll just smile.”
In 1988, social psychologist Fritz Strack published a study that seemed to confirm that facial feedback was real. The researchers asked participants to do more or less what I asked you to do earlier: hold a pen in their mouths in a position that forced them either to bare their teeth in a facsimile of a smile or to purse their lips around the pen. To ensure that no one was clued in to the researchers’ interest in smiles, the experimenters told participants that they were exploring how people with physical disabilities might write or perform other ordinary tasks.
When both groups were shown a set of newspaper comics — specifically, illustrations from Gary Larson’s The Far Side — the teeth-barers rated the images as funnier than the lip-pursers did. This was a big deal for the facial feedback hypothesis: Even though participants weren’t thinking about smiling or their mood, just moving their face into a smile-like shape seemed to affect their emotions. And so the finding made its way into psychology textbooks and countless news headlines. Decades of corroboration followed, as researchers published other experiments that also showed support for the facial feedback hypothesis.
But in 2016, all at once, 17 labs failed to replicate the pen study.
The pen study had been solid — until it wasn’t.
Those 17 studies, coordinated by Dutch psychologist E.J. Wagenmakers, repeated the original study as closely as possible to see if its result held up, with just a few changes. They found a new set of cartoons and pre-tested them to check they were about as funny as the old set. They also changed how they checked up on the participants’ pen technique: The original had an experimenter watching over things, but Wagenmakers and his team filmed participants instead.
When all 17 studies failed to replicate the original result, the effect was “devastating for the emotion literature,” said Nicholas Coles, a psychology grad student whose research focuses on the facial feedback effect. “Almost all emotion theories suggest that facial feedback should influence emotions.” While there are plenty of other methods for looking at facial feedback, many of them are more likely to make participants figure out the real purpose of the experiment, which makes their results trickier to interpret. The pen study had been solid — until it wasn’t.
These kinds of failed attempts to replicate other researchers’ results have been piling up in psychology’s “replication crisis,” which has called the reliability of psychology’s back catalogue into question. Past experiments may be unreliable because they relied on small sample sizes, buried boring or inconclusive results, or used statistical practices that make chance findings look like meaningful signals in what is really random noise. The result has been a morass of uncertainty: Which findings will hold up? And when one doesn’t, what precisely does that mean?
Wagenmakers and his team are just one of the many collaborations hoping to reshape psychology in the image of more established sciences like physics and genetics, where huge international consortia are already commonplace. Some collaborations, like the “Many Labs” projects, conduct multi-lab replications similar to the attempt to confirm the pen study and cover a broad swath of famous psychology studies. Others — like the ManyBabies Consortium, which conducts infant research — concentrate on a niche.
Then there’s the Psychological Science Accelerator, which is more focused on creating the infrastructure for collaboration, allowing its members to democratically elect studies to be run across its network of 548 labs in 72 countries. A recent paper by a group of reforming researchers called this kind of crowdsourced science one of the routes to “scientific utopia.”
Across six multi-lab replication projects, each trying to replicate multiple studies, only 47 percent of the 190 original results were successfully replicated. The failed attempt to replicate the pen study is in good company.
But as powerful as multi-lab replication efforts like these are, they aren’t necessarily the last word. When psychology tries to solve its replication crisis, it can sometimes create a crisis of a different kind, opening up a knowledge vacuum where an apparently reliable finding had previously stood.
Fritz Strack, the lead researcher on the original pen-in-mouth study from 1988, doesn’t think that Wagenmakers’s study tells us all that much — the world is constantly changing, and re-running an old experiment could produce new results not because the idea being tested is flawed but because the experiment itself is now out of step with the times. Although he suggested the replication effort himself, and advised on the design and the materials of the study, he refused to be fully involved. Instead, he said, he wanted the freedom to comment on the problems as he saw them without pulling any punches.
“Things are changing — times are changing, the zeitgeist is changing, the culture is changing, the participants are changing. It’s not under your control.”
When the results were released, Strack found plenty of things to critique. He was concerned that newspaper cartoons would not have packed the same humor punch these days that they did in the Midwest of the 1980s. The filming, he said, was another problem: It could be that filming made participants unusually self-conscious, affecting their experience of the task.
Strack thinks that it’s a mistake to focus on testing a method rather than a hypothesis. A method that fails might have been a bad test of the hypothesis, but the hypothesis is really what counts.
In this case, the hypothesis was that facial feedback can create an emotional effect even when people aren’t aware that their facial expression is an emotional one. Perhaps, Strack argued, his exact methods from the 1980s are no longer the best way to test that.
“Exact” replications are impossible, he said. “Things are changing — times are changing, the zeitgeist is changing, the culture is changing, the participants are changing. It’s not under your control.” What if you did the pen study with memes instead of cartoons? What if you didn’t use cameras? What would the differences tell us about facial feedback and when it comes into play?
Strack has been vocally critical of the credibility revolution, arguing that the term “replication crisis” is overblown. He says he prefers to focus on arguments about the quality of the research methods, rather than the statistical framework that is at the core of the credibility revolution’s concerns.
But similar critiques of massive replications come from inside the movement. Psychologist Tal Yarkoni, an ardent reformer, thinks that large-scale research efforts would do more good if they were used to test a huge array of different ways of getting at a question. A failed attempt to replicate a particular experiment doesn’t really tell you anything about the underlying theory, he said; all it tells you is that one particular design works or doesn’t work.
Wagenmakers doesn’t think his team’s replication is the final word on the facial feedback theory, either. “It’s a sign of good research that additional questions are raised,” he said. But he does think a failed replication like the one he led shifts the burden of proof. Now, he says, proponents of the facial feedback hypothesis should be the ones coming to the table with new evidence. Otherwise, “the replicating team will be like a dog playing fetch,” he said. “A person throws a ball and the [replication] team brings it back, but oh, it’s not quite right! I’m going to throw it in another direction. … It could go on forever. It’s clearly not a solution to the problem.”
Multi-lab studies can look large and impressive, said psychologist Charles Ebersole, who coordinated two Many Labs projects in grad school. Even so, it’s not clear how much confidence people should have in their results — the studies are big, which can improve confidence in their outcomes, but they’re subject to flaws and limitations just like smaller studies are. “Some people do an excellent job of not listening to [multi-lab studies] at all; maybe that’s the right answer? Some people bet a lot on them; maybe that’s the right answer? I don’t know.”
The way out of the replication crisis clearly isn’t brute replication alone.
When Wagenmakers and his colleagues published their replication study in 2016, Coles was digging deeply into the facial feedback literature. He planned to combine all of the existing literature into a giant analysis that could give a picture of the whole field. Was there really something promising going on with the facial feedback hypothesis? Or did the experiments that found a big fat zero cancel out the exciting findings? He was thrilled to be able to throw so much new data from 17 replication efforts into the pot.
He came up from his deep dive with intriguing findings: Overall, across hundreds of results, there was a small but reliable facial feedback effect. This left a new uncertainty hanging over the facial feedback hypothesis. Might there still be something going on — something that Wagenmakers’s replication attempt had missed?
If the studies thrown into the mix aren’t great to start with, the result isn’t particularly reliable — or, as Coles put it, “crap in, crap out.”
Coles didn’t think that either Wagenmakers’s replication or his own study could put the matter to rest. The technique he used, called a meta-analysis, comes with its own problems. Specifically, if the studies thrown into the mix aren’t great to start with, the result isn’t particularly reliable — or, as Coles put it, “crap in, crap out.”
So he set about designing a different kind of multi-lab collaboration. He wanted not just to replicate the original study, but to test it in a new way. And he wanted to test it in a way that would convince both the skeptics and those who still stood by the original result. He started to pull together a large team of researchers that included Strack. He also asked Phoebe Ellsworth, a researcher who was testing the facial feedback effect as far back as the 1970s, to come on board as a critic.
This partnership founded in disagreement is meant to get the game of fetch out of the way before the study even gets off the ground. Coles’s group, called the Many Smiles Collaboration, is far from the only one using this tactic; although some massive collaborations try to replicate old studies as closely as possible, others choose to workshop a new experiment methodology in excruciating detail before pulling the trigger. Ideally, this means that everyone will be convinced by the results, regardless of what they were personally rooting for or expecting. “It isn’t groupthink,” said Coles. “We’re actually trying to get at the truth.”
The Many Smiles Collaboration is based on the pen study from 1988, but with considerable tweaking. Through a lengthy back-and-forth between collaborators, peer reviewers and the journal editor, the team has refined the original plan, eventually arriving at a method that everyone agrees is a good test of the hypothesis. If it finds no effect, said Strack, “that would be a strong argument that maybe the facial feedback hypothesis is not true.”
An early pilot of the Many Smiles study indicated that the hypothesis might not be on its last legs just yet: The results suggested that smiling can affect feelings of happiness. Later this year, all the collaborators will kick into gear to see if the pilot’s findings can be repeated across 21 labs in 19 countries. If they find the same results, will that be enough to convince even the skeptics that it’s not just a fluke?
Well … maybe. A study like Wagenmakers’s sounds, in principle, like enough to lay a scientific question to rest, but it wasn’t. A study like Coles’s sounds like it could be definitive too, but it probably won’t be. Even Big Science can’t make science simple. “I’m still a little unsure, even though I’ve now replicated the effects successfully in my own labs,” said Coles. “I’ll hold my breath until the full data set comes in.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

But as the NFL season gets started Thursday, there’s some promise for gamblers in betting on projected team win totals. Half-win totals from 8.5 on down seem to be very solid bets to hit the over, even when accounting for the vigorish, or house margin.
Money-line data is only available for a subset of the years for which we have win totals, but using a curated data set covering 2003 through 2018 provided by FiveThirtyEight contributor Greg Guglielmo, I calculated the implied probability that a team would hit the over for each half-win total below nine wins and compared it to the actual win percentage of those NFL teams. Surprisingly, there appears to be an edge.
Vegas typically wants a healthy margin on its action — the vigorish on win totals averages about 30 percent. But blindly betting the over on half-point totals from 5.5 to 8.5 wins since 2003 is nearly a push, with the house netting just a percentage point edge. And if you were to bet any of the half-point totals where the under is favored (indicated by a money line that is positive), you would actually come ahead, beating the house by 3 percentage points. Put in a way more familiar to gamblers: If you bet $100 on each of the 110 half-point overs in the sample with positive money lines, you’d come out ahead $330.
So why is there a systematic undervaluing of teams with half-point win predictions? One possible explanation might be that the public isn’t exactly sure how to value them; half-point totals aren’t particularly intuitive to bet. Additionally, perhaps there hasn’t been a widespread interest in surveying historical odds and win predictions, so bettors may not be particularly aware of the lack of calibration of the closing lines.
I ran this finding by professional bettor Seth Burn, and he pointed out that half-point win totals with the under favored don’t appear to exist currently, so perhaps the edge has already been squeezed out of the market. Or perhaps it’s a phantom edge that never really existed in the first place.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-handle-an-outlier-poll/,2019-09-03,,,features,"Sep. 3, 2019",How To Handle An Outlier Poll,Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"It’s pretty rare that a pollster calls his own survey an “outlier.” But that’s exactly what happened last week after a Monmouth University poll showed an approximate three-way tie between Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute — an A-plus-rated pollster according to FiveThirtyEight — issued a statement describing his latest Democratic primary poll as an outlier that diverged from other recent polls of the race. (Indeed, there were quite a few national polls last week, and most of them continue to show Biden in front, with about 30 percent of the vote, and Sanders and Warren in the mid-to-high teens.)
But Murray doesn’t have any real reason to apologize. Outliers are a part of the business. In theory, 1 in 20 polls should fall outside the margin of error as a result of chance alone. One out of 20 might not sound like a lot, but by the time we get to the stretch run of the Democratic primary campaign in January, we’ll be getting literally dozens of new state and national polls every week. Inevitably, some of them are going to be outliers. Not to mention that the margin of error, which traditionally describes sampling error — what you get from surveying only a subset of voters rather than the whole population — is only one of several major sources of error in polls.
What should you do about these seeming outliers? If you’re a pollster, you should follow Monmouth’s lead and publish them!! In fact, printing the occasional expectations-defying result is a sign that a pollster is doing good and honest work. Plus, sometimes those “outliers” turn out to be right. Ann Selzer’s final poll of Iowa’s U.S. Senate race in 2014, which showed Republican Joni Ernst ahead by 7 percentage points over her Democratic opponent, might have looked like an outlier at the time, but it was the only one that came close to approximating her 8.5-point margin of victory there. The small handful of polls that showed Donald Trump leading in Pennsylvania in 2016 look pretty good too, even though most Pennsylanvia polls had Hillary Clinton leading.
In the long run, failure to publish results that pollsters presume to be outliers can yield far more embarrassment for the industry than the occasional funky-looking set of topline numbers. Suppressing outliers is a form of herding, a practice in which pollsters are influenced by other polls and strive to keep results within a narrow consensus. Herding makes polling averages less accurate, and it makes polling less objective. And more often than you’d think, it winds up being a case of the blind leading the blind. One recent example comes from Australia, where despite the Labor Party holding only a narrow and tenuous lead, pollsters declined to publish polls showing the conservatives narrowly ahead instead. The conservatives went on to a modest win, yielding a national controversy about polling that could have been avoided if the pollsters had trusted their numbers instead of the conventional wisdom.
About 99.99 percent of you reading this right now aren’t actually pollsters, though. So what’s my advice to you as news consumers when you encounter a poll that looks like an outlier?
To a first approximation, the best advice is to toss it into the average. Definitely do not assume that it’s the new normal. You don’t need to read dramatically headlined newspaper articles and watch breathless cable news segments about it. In a race with many polls, any one poll should rarely make all that much news. But you shouldn’t “throw out” the poll either. Instead, it should incrementally affect your priors. In the case of the Monmouth poll last week, for instance, you shouldn’t have assumed that the race had suddenly become a three-way tie, but you should have inched up your estimate of how well Sanders and Warren were doing compared with Biden.
For extra credit, pay attention to sample size. The Monmouth poll surveyed only 298 Democratic voters, which is small even by the standards of primary polls (which often survey fewer voters than general election polls do). Sample size is a complicated topic — as I mentioned, sampling error is only one source of polling error, and it’s not always the most important one. But as a rough rule of thumb, any poll with fewer than about 500 or 600 respondents is substantially more likely to have outlier-ish results because of sampling error than one that surveyed a larger number of voters. And polls with only 300 voters are especially likely to have issues.
So that’s the Polling 101 answer. When you see a poll that looks like an outlier, just throw it into the average. If you want, you can give some consideration to the sample size and the quality of the pollster.
But if you’ve read FiveThirtyEight for a while, you’ve probably heard that Polling 101 answer before. So I’m also going to give you the Polling 201 answer. But I want you to promise that you’ll abide by it fairly strictly, rather than interpret it too liberally. Pinky swear? OK, great. Then here goes:
If a poll shows a significant change in the race, you should tend to presume it’s an outlier unless it’s precipitated by a major news or campaign event.
Corollary: You should be much more open to the possibility that a poll reflects a real change if it’s among the first polls following a major news or campaign event.
What do I mean by a “major” news or campaign event? Some fairly specific types of things. When I made you pinky swear earlier, I was asking you to stick precisely to this list:
Debates.
Candidates entering or exiting the race, or clinching their nominations.
Primary and caucus results (e.g., the Iowa caucuses occur and that has knockoff effects on the next set of states).
The conventions.
The announcement of vice presidential candidates.
The final week of the campaign.
Spectacular, blockbuster news events that dominate the news cycle for a week or more. (There generally are only one or two of these per campaign cycle, if that many.)
The first five examples are fairly straightforward. The party conventions, for instance, almost always produce bounces, which then fade over the course of a few weeks. Debates can also produce shifts, which can range from permanent to (more often) ephemeral; Kamala Harris’s bounce faded after the first presidential debate, for instance. Be careful with the fifth category, vice presidential selections, since not many VPs are true game-changers. But an outside-of-the-box pick — i.e., Sarah Palin in 2008 — can sometimes produce a polling shift.
The sixth category, the end of the campaign, is less well-known as a source of polling movement, but the final days of the campaign can produce sharp shifts in the polls as undecided voters finally settle upon a candidate and as supporters of candidates who look like they can’t win (say, a Libertarian who is polling at 4 percent) hold their noses and pick one of the major contenders. Often, especially in primaries, this movement occurs fairly late — within the final week of the campaign or even the final 24 to 48 hours (in which case it may occur too late to show up in polls). There’s no guarantee that undecided voters will evenly divide themselves between the major candidates; in Wisconsin in 2016, for example, voters who decided in the final few days went almost 2-1 for Trump over Clinton.
So you generally should pay more attention to polling movement in the final few days of the campaign. Frankly, this is the time when you should panic a bit if the polls are moving away from your candidate.1
Essentially all of the polling shifts so far in the Democratic primary fall into one of the first two categories. Look at the RealClearPolitics average over the past six months, and the major changes you see are as follows:
A big bump for Biden after his entry to the race in late April, which faded over the course of several weeks.
A decline for Sanders coinciding with Biden’s entry into the race.
A big bounce for Harris, and a decline for Biden, after the first debate — both of which gradually reversed themselves.
An additional modest decline for Harris, and a modest increase for Warren, after the second debate.
A modest-sized bounce for Beto O’Rourke after he began his campaign.
And a bump for Pete Buttigieg in late April and early May.

							So almost all of the sudden polling movement for the Democrats has been associated with debates or candidates launching their campaigns. The major exception is Buttigieg’s relatively abrupt surge, which may have been partly triggered by his town hall on CNN — certainly not an event that comes anywhere near qualifying under my seven categories above. Sharp polling movement sometimes does occur outside of these categories, but not very often. So you should err on the side of being conservative. It’s not that other sorts of news or campaign events can’t surprise you and change the polls. It’s just that you’d want to see several polls pointing toward a shift before you buy that they do.
The final category, blockbuster news stories, is the one where there’s the most room for subjectivity – and therefore the one you need to be most cautious about. Keep in mind that the overwhelming majority of news stories are less important to the campaign than they seem at the time. So if you’re the type of person whose life is caught up in the daily news cycle — or someone who works in politics for a living — you’re probably better off just ignoring this category entirely.
But stories that dominate the news cycle for a week or more and interrupt all other political coverage can change the polls, of course. To get a more objective idea of which stories qualify, you can look toward political aggregators like Memorandum, which archive their results to show which stories were dominating the news cycle on any given day. Many stories that people think of as political blockbusters really only last for two to three days.
What stories meet this threshold? In the 2018 midterms, probably only Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. In 2016, the “Access Hollywood” tape and the Comey letter. In 2012, nothing, really. In 2008, the financial crisis was an ongoing story, but the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy on Sept. 15 touched off a series of acute events that reoriented the race. Events such as the publication of the Mueller report, Hurricane Katrina, the killing of Osama Bin Laden, the stock market crash of 1987 and the start of the Iraq War would also have qualified, had they occurred in the middle of election campaigns.
Let’s close with one more reason not to get all that excited about short-term polling swings. It’s one I’ve already alluded a couple times, but it probably can’t be emphasized enough. Polling shifts driven by campaign and news events often reverse themselves once the news cycle moves on to another topic. So even if the movement is real, it may be temporary. It will be highly relevant if the election is right around the corner, but less so if it’s several months away.
By contrast, gradual, long-term polling movement — of the sort that Warren has benefited from over the course of several months, for example — can be more durable. It’s entirely plausible that Warren has been gaining a point or two every few weeks not because of any specific news stories but just as a result of persuasion as voters become more familiar with her campaign. If you’re a Warren fan, that’s what should get you excited — and not the next outlier poll that comes along.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Still, we know that plenty of Democrats have been paying attention, too. But which Democrats are most likely to be plugged in?
It turns out that the most ideological voters tend to be the most politically engaged, so in this case that means very liberal Democrats are the ones paying the closest attention. In fact, if we look at the five most recent Quinnipiac University polls where Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters were asked if they were paying “a lot” of attention to the presidential campaign, you’ll see that, on average, about 64 percent of those who identified as “very liberal” were paying a lot of attention, compared to about 48 percent of “somewhat liberal” Democrats and 47 percent of “moderate/conservative” Democrats.

These super plugged-in, very liberal voters are also increasingly backing one candidate: Sen. Elizabeth Warren. In June, 29 percent of these voters said they supported Warren, and by early August — after her strong performance in the second primary debate — that number had grown to 40 percent. The latest August survey put her at 34 percent among these voters, while no other candidate earned more than 22 percent.

And since 46 percent of Democrats now identify as liberal, that subset of Democratic primary voters could offer a big boost for Warren’s campaign if she can continue to make inroads among these very liberal (and somewhat liberal) Democrats. That 46 percent number, which was published in a Pew Research Center report that tracked the ideological views of adults who identify as Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, was the largest share to identify as liberal since Pew first asked the question in 2003. To be clear, though, the majority of Democrats (53 percent) still identified as “moderate” or “conservative,” which could open up a path to the nomination for a candidate like former Vice President Joe Biden.
But the fact that those who identify as very liberal also tend to be more politically engaged means it’s also quite possible that the people who actually turn out to vote in the Democratic primary will be more liberal than Democrats as a whole. For instance, in the five most recent Quinnipiac polls, the Democratic respondents were, on average, roughly evenly split between those who identified as “very” or “somewhat liberal” and those who identified as “moderate” or “conservative.” So if the Democratic voting base is slightly more liberal than the party as a whole, a candidate like Warren could benefit.
Nonetheless, someone like Biden who appeals to more moderate members of the party may still have an advantage, even if his base isn’t quite as engaged. And that’s because Biden has solid support among moderate Democrats — 41 percent of moderate or conservative voters backed him in the latest Quinnipiac poll — plus he gets a decent backing among somewhat liberal voters, who were about 6 points more likely to support him than Warren in that same poll (29 percent for Biden to 23 percent for Warren).
And winning over just the very liberal voters won’t be enough for Warren either, as Quinnipiac’s data suggests that they make up about a quarter of the party. So even if very liberal voters are more engaged, Warren will still need to expand beyond these voters to have a chance of winning the nomination.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

After two weeks spent trailing behind Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in the share of online news stories that mention him, Biden was once again the most mentioned candidate in online news, according to data from Media Cloud,1 a database of online news stories.
And as he has for weeks, he was mentioned in more cable news clips than any other Demcoratic candidate for president. Biden was mentioned in about half of all the clips that mentioned any 2020 Democratic contender last week, according to data from the TV News Archive,2 which chops up cable news across the three networks we monitor — CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC — into 15-second clips. That’s the highest share of cable and online news coverage that Biden has received since the second Democratic debate, and almost the highest since the first debate.

Each network’s daily news coverage is chopped up into 15-second clips, and each clip that includes a candidate’s name is counted as one mention. For both cable and online news, our search queries look for an exact match for each candidate’s name, except for Julian Castro, for whom our search query is “Julian Castro” OR “Julián Castro.” Media Cloud searches use two of the database’s publication lists: “top online news” and “digital native” publications.

While Biden’s coverage increased on both mediums, both Warren and Sanders were mentioned a little more in cable news clips but not in online news stories. The biggest gain of the week — outside of Biden — came from Andrew Yang, whose share of online news stories increased the most after that of the former vice president. Yang’s share of online news mentions almost doubled between last week and the previous week, but he didn’t see much of an increase in the share of cable news clips that mentioned him. Last Tuesday, the hashtag #YangMediaBlackout trended on Twitter after CNN didn’t include him in a graphic of a Quinnipiac poll, even though he polled higher than another candidate who was included.
Despite the increase in Yang’s online coverage, he still doesn’t get anywhere near as much media attention as the highest-polling candidates in either medium. As the field continues to winnow, the media seems to be focusing more of its attention on Biden, Warren and Sanders.

But It Doesn’t Help, Either.",Josh Planos,FiveThirtyEight,College Football,"When David Shaw informed his parents that he was Stanford’s new head football coach, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house. “Pride,” he recalled in an interview this offseason, “is such a small word for that feeling.”
Shaw remains at the helm nearly a decade later.
Stanford is where Shaw was a four-year letterwinner and where his dad was nearly elevated to head coach. It’s where Shaw met his wife and where he proposed; where he left and where he returned. The lockscreen on his iPad is a family photo taken among the eucalyptus trees on campus in 1975, then replicated some 35 years later. “To have so much of your life associated with a place,” Shaw told me, “is weird.”
An alma mater, Shaw contends, is an extension of home. In turn, its people — from the dining hall staff to the university board of directors — are akin to family. In 1957, Paul “Bear” Bryant left a winning program in College Station to return to Tuscaloosa, where the Alabama Crimson Tide had endured a fourth consecutive losing season. Why? “I’ve heard mama calling,” he told his players.
Hiring an alumnus1 has been a marketable, low-risk, high-reward strategy for athletic departments for almost a half-century. Unless a splashy move is feasible, if an athletic director seeks to turn around a program — or merely wants to sell more tickets — there are far worse blueprints to follow than returning someone to their roots. Which is perhaps why alumni have permeated the market for much of the modern era. Since 1975, 38 FBS football programs2 hired more than one alumnus as head coach.3 Over that period, there was only one season in which alumni didn’t hold at least 10 percent of the available head coaching gigs.

And recently, hiring from within has been a successful strategy. Alumni accounted for roughly a quarter of the coaches represented in last season’s final Top 25 rankings. This season, alumni will command 18 programs, or 13.8 percent of the market. The fraternity includes long-tenured stalwarts (Northwestern’s Pat Fitzgerald and Air Force’s Troy Calhoun) in addition to the more idiosyncratic personalities in the sport (Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh and Oklahoma State’s Mike Gundy).
Shaw was hired to “take the dips out of Stanford football.” He became the winningest coach in program history two years ago. But was the university seal on Shaw’s diploma in any way predictive of that success? And more broadly, does an alumnus traditionally make for an exceptional hire?


There were 27 head-coaching changes this offseason, but only one — Northern Illinois’s hiring of Thomas Hammock — involved an alumnus returning home. Hammock and 11 other head coaches — all non-alums — made their FBS coaching debuts over the weekend, while Miami’s Manny Diaz made his debut the previous Saturday.
If the recent success of certain high-profile alumni head coaches is predictive, Hammock should lead a successful squad in 2019. Kirby Smart’s Georgia Bulldogs were among the most efficient teams in the country. Fitzgerald led Northwestern to its first appearance in the Big Ten title game a third consecutive bowl game victory. Jeff Tedford coached Fresno State to its best season in school history. Scott Satterfield turned Appalachian State into the darlings of the Sun Belt and parlayed it into a job at Louisville. Bryan Harsin led Boise State to the Mountain West championship game for the second consecutive season.
In total, alumni head coaches went 159-122 (.566) in 2018. According to Sports-Reference.com’s Simple Rating System, the average alumnus-led program was 4.16 points better than the average team in 2018, the highest mark of any season since 1975. However, alumni-coached teams have also seen a broad range success relative to the average team in this time period.

There were 146 alumni head coaches from 1975 through 2018. In total, they won 52.6 percent of their games, and the median alumnus-coached team was 2.2 points better than the average team in a given season. Non-alumni head coaches, of which there were 641, won 51.1 percent of their games and were on average 0.37 points better than the average team in a given season.
That divide has increased over the last 20 years. Alumni head coaches have gone 2469-2029 (.549), while non-alumni have gone 13177-12299 (.349).4
In addition to recent success, there are several qualities that make the alumni coaches unique. Alumni traditionally begin their college head coaching careers where they suited up. Of the 146 alumni head coaches from 1975 to 2018, only 26 (17.8 percent) had previous Division I head coaching experience. That has continued to be the norm. Since 2000, of the 53 alumni head coaches who were hired, all but eight were becoming first-time head coaches.
Hawaii head coach Nick Rolovich knew at some point in his career he’d return to Honolulu. It ended up being where he got his first crack as the man in charge. “One of my real goals in coaching is to repay Hawaii [for] what Hawaii as a state and a university gave me,” Rolovich said. “Which is everything.”
And once installed at the head of the program, alumni seldom leave. Of the aforementioned sample, more than 75 percent didn’t take another Division I head coaching gig after securing the job, and nearly 70 percent spent their entire college coaching careers at their alma mater.
One potential reason for this continuity is that alumni seem to be working with a longer leash, perhaps as a result of performance. Since 1975, more than 80 percent of alumni head coaches lasted at least three years with a program, while the same is true for just 15 percent of non-alumni. While more than 12 percent of alumni last at least 10 years, only 2.2 percent of non-alumni can say the same.5
Some alumni coaches attribute this trend to their one of their strengths: having already demonstrated an ability to represent the university well as a student-athlete. “It’s very easy for me to talk about Boise State,” Boise State head coach Bryan Harsin said. “I don’t need a map.”
“If you can have success, then hopefully they’ll be proud of you,” Fitzgerald said. “That’s the hope, at least.”


That isn’t to say there aren’t obstacles. The allure of returning home is countered by increased expectations, both from inside and outside the locker room. Happiness is fickle and patience wears thin when losses pile up. And sometimes winning isn’t enough, even at your alma mater. At Maryland, Ralph Friedgen was fired after going 9-4 and winning ACC Coach of the Year. He later burned his diploma.
“A lot of times, criticism is a faceless person,” Western Michigan head coach Tim Lester said. “But at your alma mater, sometimes it’s a little bit harder because you do know who they are.”
It can be a challenge to remember that it is, in fact, a job.
“You have to be able to mix the business side with the side where your heart is,” Rolovich said.
Regardless of the campus where a coach cut his teeth, the terms of employment remain clear. In college football, the long-term prognosis isn’t stable. “Either we’re going to get fired or we’re going to leave,” former Tulsa head coach Bill Blankenship said. Blankenship coached at Tulsa, his alma mater, from 2011 to 2014. “The odds of retiring at the school that hired you is a pretty low percentage.”


But is hiring an alumnus predictive in any significant way?
Not especially.
To measure how predictive hiring an alumnus is of on-field performance, I pulled all of the head coaches from 1975 to 2018 as well as their alma maters, their head coaching experience and their team’s SRS (as well as its previous season SRS), removing interims from the sample.6 Then I ran a linear regression. Controlling for the coach’s experience and the previous SRS of the team, coaches at their alma maters are statistically indistinguishable from non-alumni.
However, a team’s previous season SRS (0.72) is far more predictive of on-field performance — each point of SRS in a previous season is worth around three-quarters of a point in the current one. Furthermore, whether it was the first year of a head coach at a given school is also more predictive of on-field performance than whether they were an alumnus; being a newcomer is strongly negatively correlated with performance (-1.53 SRS).
Plus, despite the recent success they’ve had, in terms of historic single-season performance, alumni haven’t produced a ton. Of the 20 best single seasons, as defined by SRS, only one7 was coached by an alumnus.
Phillip Fulmer is the last coach to win a national title at his alma mater. That was in 1998. Since 1949, only Steve Spurrier, Bryant, Ralph Jordan and Frank Leahy can say the same.


When Shaw’s legacy is written, it will no doubt be penned in cardinal red.
“It’s one thing to fit the program, it’s another thing to fit the entire institution,” Shaw said. “Because I went to school here, I understand the ethos, I understand the air of this place.”
But despite the recent tear of success, that indelible connection that he and fellow alumni head coaches have isn’t terribly predictive of future success.

Earlier this year, my colleague Harry Enten documented evidence of pollster “herding” — the tendency of polling firms to produce results that closely match one another, especially toward the end of a campaign.1 What’s wrong with the polls agreeing with one another? The problem is that it’s sometimes a case of the blind leading the blind. Take a look at the polls conducted in this year’s Senate race in Iowa, for example:

This chart depicts every likely voter poll conducted over the final nine weeks of the campaign and how each compared to the polling average at the time. (We’ll get into more detail about how this polling average is calculated later on.) In September, when many voters (and pollsters) were just tuning into the race, there was plenty of diversity in the Iowa polls. A Loras College poll completed on Sept. 5 put Democrat Bruce Braley ahead by almost 5 percentage points against Republican Joni Ernst. Just 10 days later, Quinnipiac University completed a poll showing Ernst up by 6 points instead. That would soon be followed by a Selzer & Company poll for the Des Moines Register that had Ernst ahead by the same 6-point margin.
By the end of the campaign, however, the polls were in much stronger agreement. Twelve of the final 13 surveys had the race at somewhere between a 1-point lead for Braley and a 4-point lead for Ernst — a tight consensus suggesting a narrow edge for the Republican. Even Quinnipiac had Iowa tied in its final poll. The lone exception was Selzer’s final poll for the Des Moines Register, which had Ernst up by 7 points — a result that pollster J. Ann Selzer would take an awful lot of grief about despite her stellar track record.
Better ignore that “outlier” poll from Selzer, right? Nope, not in this case. Ernst ended up winning by 8.5 percentage points. Most polls correctly identified Ernst as the winner, but Selzer’s poll was the only one in the final days to come close to her margin of victory.
It’s not the inaccuracy of the polling average that should bother you — Iowa was one of many states where the polls overestimated how well Democrats would do — so much as the consensus around such a wrong result. This consensus very likely reflects herding. In this case, pollsters herded toward the wrong number.
In the Iowa chart, the shaded gray area represents the polling average plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. You can see how a number of polls fell outside the shaded area in September but that only the Selzer poll did in the final week or two of the race.
The 3.5 point range is important because it reflects sampling error: the intrinsic, unavoidable uncertainty introduced by taking a random sample of voters rather than surveying the whole population. Specifically, it’s the standard error associated with a poll sampling 800 voters — the typical size of a Senate poll this year — in estimating the margin between the candidates. The standard error is not quite the same thing as the more familiar margin of error, but it gets at the same idea.2 Whereas the “true” result3 should fall within the margin of error 95 percent of the time, it should fall within the range established by the standard error about 68 percent of the time.
This necessarily implies that about 32 percent of results should fall outside the standard error.4 As I said, sampling error is unavoidable — an intrinsic part of polling. If you’ve collected enough polls and don’t find that at least 32 percent of them deviate from the polling average by 3.5 percentage points,5 it means something funny — like herding — is going on.
In fact, 32 percent is an optimistic estimate. It accounts for sampling error alone and not the other sources of uncertainty in polling. It’s hard to reach certain voters and hard to know who will turn out to vote, especially in midterm elections. News events can change the campaign after you’ve conducted your poll.
But sampling error alone produces considerably noisier polling than you might expect. The next table (click to expand) consists of a series of simulations where I’ve conducted “polls” by drawing random numbers from a normal probability distribution with a standard error of 3.5 percentage points. To make things more familiar, I’ve calibrated the numbers so they’re distributed around an average that matches how the Senate polling looked late this year. In Iowa, for instance, the average has Ernst ahead by 2 percentage points and the standard error of 3.5 points is distributed around that number.

People would have freaked out if some of these results were released in the end stages of this year’s campaign. Look at all those “outliers”:
One poll has Republican Cory Gardner up by 8 points in Colorado. Another one has Democrat Mark Udall ahead by 4!
Republican Bill Cassidy leads by 9 points in one Louisiana poll. But Democrat Mary Landrieu is leading in another!
Two polls have the Democrat Michelle Nunn ahead in Georgia. Another has Republican David Perdue up 12 points!
Are these polls skewed? No. This is exactly what polls should look like under ideal conditions — when sampling error is the only thing they have to worry about. Under real-world conditions, where there are other sources of uncertainty, the polls should vary even more than this.
But by the end of the campaign this year, the polls in most states varied only within a narrow range. The next chart describes how much polls across all this year’s Senate races deviated from the polling average in their states at the time they were conducted.6 The polling average is calculated as follows: Each new poll is compared against other polls of the same state conducted somewhere between one day and 21 days beforehand.7 In calculating the average, I used a maximum of one poll (the most recent one) from each polling firm and didn’t compare a polling firm against itself.8
These averages should closely resemble those from sites like Real Clear Politics. Note that they are trailing averages — they don’t reflect any data from after the poll was conducted. I’m limiting the analysis to cases where there had been at least three other polls conducted in the previous 21 days, enough that we have a reasonable sense of where the consensus stood on the race.
There’s a lot going on in this chart, so let’s take a look and then talk about it.

The gray circles represent the results of individual polls (about 300 of them). They show the absolute difference between the new poll and the polling average (without regard to whether the new poll was more Democratic- or Republican-leaning than the average).
The data is noisy. But the red trend line, which is based on loess regression,9 reflects how much polls were typically deviating from the polling averages. In early September, for example, the typical poll deviated from the polling average by about 3.5 percentage points.
As the election season wore on, new polls hewed somewhat more closely to the polling averages. But the change was marginal until the final week or two of the campaign, when they started to track it much more closely. By the eve of the election, new polls came within about 1.7 percentage points of the polling average.
Perhaps you could construct some rationale, apart from herding, for why the polls behaved this way. Maybe it became easier to predict who was going to vote and that made methodological differences between polling firms matter less. As a more technical matter, the volume of polling increased as the election approached; this presents some complications, which I address in the footnotes.10
But there are two dead giveaways that herding happened. One is the unusual shape of the curve. Rather than abiding by a linear progression, it suddenly veers toward zero in the final week or so of the campaign.
What happened during this period? It’s when pollsters were releasing their final polls of the campaign — the ones they think posterity will judge them by. These polls were included in the final Real Clear Politics averages and received a heavy weight in the final FiveThirtyEight forecast.
The impolite way to put it is that this was CYA (cover-your-ass) time for pollsters. Some that had produced “outlier” results before suddenly fell in line with the consensus.
The other giveaway is the one we discovered before in Iowa. By the end of the campaign, new polls diverged from the polling averages by less than they plausibly could if they were taking random samples and not tinkering with them.
As I mentioned before, an 800-person poll has a standard error of 3.5 percentage points because of sampling error alone. A related calculation is the average error introduced by sampling. As a rule of thumb, the average error is equal to about 80 percent of the standard error — or in this case, about 2.8 percentage points.
This is the theoretical limit on how accurate polls can be. Even if pollsters knew, for instance, that David Perdue would win by exactly 7.9 percentage points in Georgia (as he did), they’d still miss this result by 2.8 points on average when collecting 800-person samples.
In fact, however, the new polls deviated from the polling average by less than 2 points by the end of the campaign. How did that happen? To be clear, I’m not accusing any pollsters of faking results. But some of them were probably “putting their thumbs on the scale,” manipulating assumptions in their polls such that they more closely matched the consensus.11
In some cases, the pollsters’ intentions may have been earnest enough. Perhaps they ran a poll in Iowa and it came back Ernst +7. That can’t be right, they’d say to themselves. No one else has the race like that. So they’d dig into their crosstabs and find something “wrong.” Ahh — that’s the problem, not enough responses from Ames and Iowa City.12 Let’s apply some geographic weights. That comes out to … Ernst +3? We can live with that.
Even when the pollsters mean well, this attitude runs counter to the objective, scientific nature of polling. As a general principle, you should not change the methodology in the middle of an experiment.
A few pollsters are shameless about their herding. One of them is Public Policy Polling (PPP), a polling firm that conducts automated polls for both public consumption and for liberal and Democratic clients.
Take a look at this exchange, for example, between The New York Times’ Nate Cohn13 and PPP’s Tom Jensen. Cohn discovered that in 2012, the racial composition of PPP’s polls was correlated in an unusual way with President Obama’s performance among white voters in their surveys. If Obama was performing especially poorly among whites in one PPP poll, it tended to have a higher share of nonwhite voters, which boosted Obama’s result. And if Obama was doing relatively well among whites, PPP projected less nonwhite turnout, keeping his lead in check. As a result, PPP’s polls tended to show an unusually steady race between Obama and Mitt Romney.
I’m picking on PPP for a reason: They’re the biggest herders in the business. Here’s the chart I showed you before, but with only PPP’s polls highlighted. On average, in states with at least three other recent polls, their polls deviated from the polling average by only 1.6 percentage points. The evidence for herding is extremely clear visually and statistically.14

So perhaps Public Policy Polling sits at the opposite end of the spectrum from J. Ann Selzer. But herding may be hard to eradicate. The paradoxical-seeming reason is that herding can make the average poll more accurate even as it makes the polling average worse. (For economics nerds — this is sort of a tragedy of the commons problem.)
To demonstrate this, I created another simulation in which pollsters engaged in herding and compared it to one where they didn’t. The rules of the simulation are as follows:
A series of 10 polls are conducted in sequence (rather than simultaneously) in a state where the Democrat and Republican are tied in the race.15
However, the pollsters don’t know the correct result ahead of time. Furthermore, their polls are subject to error. Specifically, their polls miss the correct result by an average of 5 percentage points. This figure corresponds to the historical average error among Senate polls conducted late in the campaign.
In one version of the simulation, the pollsters behave independently, publishing their number “as is” regardless of what previous polls have said.
In the other version, the pollsters herd. They do this by truncating the results they publish such that they never deviate by more than 3 percentage points from the average of previous polls. For instance, if after the first five polls are conducted the Democrat is ahead by 4 points in the polling average, the sixth pollster will never publish a result showing the Democrat ahead by more than 7 points or less than 1 point.16
The next chart shows the accuracy of individual polls in the simulation. If the polls act independently, the error stays constant at an average of 5 percentage points for each survey. If they herd instead, the first poll still has a 5-point error (it derives no benefit from herding since there are not yet any other polls to herd toward) but every subsequent poll does a little better. By the time we get to the 10th poll, it misses the actual result by an average of about 3 points rather than 5.

However, as I mentioned, what helps the polls individually hurts them collectively. The next chart shows the accuracy of the polling average as opposed to the average poll.

In both versions of the simulation, the polling average becomes more accurate as more polls are added to it. But the benefit is much greater when the polls are acting independently. In the independent case, the polling average has an error of just 1.6 percentage points by the time all 10 polls are included in it. If the polls herd, however, the polling average still misses by about 3 points even if all polls are included.
The problem is simple enough to diagnose: When pollsters herd, if the first couple of polls happen to get the outcome wrong, subsequent ones will replicate the mistake. I wonder if these dynamics explain the poor performance of the polls in some states this year. In Kansas, the final polls showed the independent candidate, Greg Orman, ahead in the Senate race by an average of 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points, but the Republican, Pat Roberts, won by 11 percentage points instead.
The first polls conducted of Kansas after the Democratic candidate dropped out of the race were from Public Policy Polling and showed Orman ahead by 10 points. PPP’s polls can be highly inaccurate when they don’t have other polls to herd toward. In this case, however, other pollsters may have herded toward PPP, producing an incorrect consensus about the race.17
This may also be part of why the polls have frequently proved to be “skewed” toward either Democrats or Republicans. In 2012, there was a significant bias toward Republicans and in 2014 a significant one toward Democrats.
This is not a new phenomenon — similar problems occurred in 1980, 1994, 1998 and 2002, among other election cycles. But 2012 and 2014 ought to disabuse us of the notion that the polls are sure to be more accurate just because there are more of them now than there once were. The whole benefit of the “wisdom of crowds” approach depends on people acting independently. A poll that regurgitates polling averages provides no independent information whatsoever.18
So … what to do about it? If you’ve read this far, you’re undoubtedly highly interested in polling. So my message for fellow polling geeks is as follows: Let’s not give pollsters so much grief the next time they publish what looks to be an “outlier.” Polling data is noisy and polling is becoming more challenging. The occasional or even not-so-occasional result that deviates from the consensus is sometimes a sign the pollster is doing good, honest work and trusting its data. It’s the inliers — the polls that always stay implausibly close to the consensus and always conform to the conventional wisdom about a race — that deserve more scrutiny instead.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-narrow-path-for-black-politicians-who-want-to-be-president-and-how-its-changing/,2019-08-30,,,features,"Aug. 23, 2019",The Narrow Path For Black Politicians Who Want To Be President — And How It’s Changing,Perry Bacon Jr.,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"The Congressional Black Caucus has existed since 1971. It included 12 House members in its early days and has gradually grown to a record-high 51 House members this year.1 Its origins are in the Democratic Party, and it remains overwhelmingly Democratic — a result of both the paucity of black Republicans elected to Congress and those few Republicans who are elected declining to join the caucus. Overall, 117 black Democrats have been House members since the 1970s.
But while white U.S. House members from both parties often end up getting elected to the Senate,2 no black Democratic House member has ever been elected senator. Or governor. Only eight black Americans have ever been popularly elected to one of those jobs in the first place. But it’s striking that there is a sizable pool of black elected officials not advancing to higher office.
The positions of governor and senator are, of course, traditional stepping stones to running for president. And that’s where CBC members remaining in the House gets even more interesting. Over the past decade, five black Democrats have either run serious presidential campaigns (Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Barack Obama) or been widely touted as possible candidates by party officials or the media (Stacey Abrams, Deval Patrick.) None of them ever served in the House.
That might seem like just a coincidence. Maybe it is. But there’s a strong case that up to now, America’s political structure has pushed forward — or allowed the emergence of — only a certain kind of black candidate for the highest offices: one with stellar credentials in white-dominated spaces and relatively moderate politics. That process has likely screened out more liberal politicians from presidential consideration (think longtime California congresswoman Barbara Lee) and those whose successes have been in traditionally black environments (the CBC, black churches, civil rights organizations).
I’ll say up front: This is more of a theory, based on my own observations and interviews of experts on race and politics rather than any kind of formal model or study of black presidential candidates. (There just isn’t much to study. The number of black people who have run for president is fairly small,3 there’s only one presidential election every four years, and even the CBC is a not a very large set of politicians.) In short, this theory isn’t foolproof, probably has exceptions and may be changing.
Let’s start with the ideology of Abrams, Booker, Harris, Obama and Patrick, compared with other black politicians. While it’s hard to quantify this, those five fall broadly in the center-left, mainstream of the Democratic Party — and not in its more leftward wing. They are liberal on economic issues but not as far left as, for example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders or Keith Ellison, a black Democrat from Minnesota who was elected the state’s attorney general in 2018, a year after more centrist Democrats successfully mobilized against Ellison becoming chair of the Democratic National Committee.
On issues of race and identity, those five generally support policies like major reforms of the criminal justice system, but none of them are leading civil rights activists-turned-politicians like Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton, who ran for president in 2004. Booker, Patrick and Obama are all known for their optimistic rhetoric, particularly in suggesting that America’s racial divides are not intractable. Abrams and Harris are significantly more blunt (maybe honest) about racial issues than Obama was — so much so in Abrams’s case that I’m not sure she fits that well into this group. But even Abrams and Harris are not on the very leftward end of the Democratic Party on racial issues.4 Overall, the party is much more liberal on racial issues than it was in 2008 — and Abrams and Harris are generally in the mainstream of that new consensus.
In contrast to those five, CBC members seeking to become governor, senator or president are likely not advancing in part because they are perceived (by both Democratic powerbrokers and voters) as too liberal to win those kinds of races. The majority of CBC members represent districts that are at least 40 percent black, aligning them with America’s most Democratic-leaning racial group.5 In part because they represent heavily Democratic-leaning districts, members of the CBC typically amass more liberal voting records than the average House Democrat, let alone the average Senate Democrat, who tends to be a bit more moderate.6
Why is being perceived as too liberal an impediment to running for governor, senator or president? For one, that perception probably hinders big-dollar fundraising. Obama (in his 2008 presidential campaign) and Booker (in his 2014 Senate run) raised a ton of money from employees of financial firms. One reason wealthy people (even those who are left-leaning) might be comfortable with these black politicians is that none of them has proposed aggressively taking on the rich like Elizabeth Warren and Sanders have.
Secondly, candidates of any race who are further from the ideological center of the two parties tend to face questions about whether they can win a general election. And there is evidence that, all else being equal, more extreme candidates do worse on average than more centrist ones. But black candidates often face “electability” questions above and beyond their actual policy record. There is some scholarly research that voters perceive black candidates and politicians as more liberal than white politicians of a similar ideology because of their race.
Electability is also an important perceived problem. Democratic activists and party leaders sometimes act like a black candidate “can’t win” in ways that probably overstate the real evidence on electability, discouraging black candidates from running for offices that they might be able to actually win.
Abrams (in her gubernatorial campaign), Obama (in 2008) and Harris (in her current presidential run) have all faced questions about electability — so being more moderate does not totally eliminate this problem. But I suspect that dynamic would have been much worse if, say, the three described their politics as “socialist” or were leading voices in pushing for reparations. (Booker and Harris embraced a bill to study the issue of reparations earlier this year. But this is not a particularly liberal stance in the current Democratic Party — white 2020 candidates such as Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren signed onto that bill too, as did more moderate Democrats like Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Chris Coons of Delaware.) Perceptions that he was too liberal to win a general election limited Jackson’s 1988 candidacy, which was the most successful presidential campaign by a black candidate until Obama’s run.
Let’s move to the biographies and credentials of the five black Democrats who have featured prominently on the national stage. Again, it’s hard to quantify this, but I doubt any academic or professional credential has been emphasized more in a campaign than Obama’s distinction as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review in 2008. Abrams (a Truman scholar), Booker (a Rhodes scholar), Harris (the first female, first black and first Asian American district attorney of San Francisco) and Patrick (undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard) have similar accolades.
American elites, particularly liberals, are obsessed with the accruing of such “meritocratic” credentials — and not just for aspiring black politicians. Supporters of Pete Buttigieg often brag that he went to Harvard, won a Rhodes scholarship and is versed in seven languages.
But I suspect this desire for out-of-this-world credentials is heightened for aspiring black politicians. As I noted, a black politician running for president can’t really run a Sanders-style candidacy — emphasizing his or her leftism — or risk being cast as unelectable for the general election. Thus, black candidates hype their credentials as a safer way to distinguish themselves. These credentials are also, in some ways, a substitute for actual political experience and accomplishments. The black politicians with a lot of experience and accomplishments (like CBC members) have often represented heavily black, Democratic areas — so they are deemed unelectable.
Finally, these credentials probably help these candidates prove they are smart and hard-working — and thus qualified to white elites and voters who might hold anti-black views, either consciously or unconsciously. Forty-two percent of Americans, including 23 percent of Democrats, agree with the view, “if blacks would try harder, they could be just as well off as whites,” according to a 2018 Public Religion Research Institute survey.
In the early years of Obama’s presidency, Trump — along with falsely suggesting that Obama was not born in the U.S. — kept hinting that Obama wasn’t smart enough to get into Columbia or Harvard (implying Obama got into those schools only because of affirmative action). Other conservatives harped on Obama’s use of a teleprompter to give speeches (even though many previous presidents had used that device, too). Obama’s accomplishments (he wasn’t just admitted to Harvard Law but was picked by his fellow students to be the law review president) provided an obvious rebuttal to these criticisms, even if the claims by conservatives and Trump were racist and should not have been taken seriously in the first place.
In the same vein, it’s possible that any mayor of Newark would be a serious contender for a U.S. Senate seat in New Jersey, but it probably helped Booker that he also had Stanford, Oxford and Yale degrees as credentials.


“The only blacks who could survive and be in a viable position in 2020 to run for president were those who moved to the center in the past to win high-profile statewide races,” said Christopher Stout, an Oregon State University professor and author of a 2015 book on black politicians.
Booker and Harris did that, successfully navigating the political system of the early 2000s and 2010s — a system that has arguably left a lot of black politicians choosing not to run for major offices or being discouraged by party officials from doing so. There is evidence, though, that the system is changing in ways that might expand the range of potential black governors, senators or even presidents.
First, something significant happened last year. In November, nine black Democrats were newly elected to Congress, and none represents a heavily black district.7 Three of the members — New York’s Antonio Delgado, Georgia’s Lucy McBath and Illinois’s Lauren Underwood — won districts that Trump carried in 2016. It will be harder for Democratic Party power brokers to suggest that these nine black House members can’t win statewide — they just won in areas that aren’t heavily black, after all. And their victories should spur Democratic officials to consider whether other black Democrats, including longtime CBC members, could win in non-black-majority areas.
Secondly, the Democratic Party’s broader leftward shift, particularly on racial issues, may also open up new possibilities for black politicians. Maybe it’s still safer ground for Beto O’Rourke, Sanders or Warren to call Trump a “white supremacist” (as all three have recently) than it is for Booker or Harris to do the same (neither has). But in a Democratic Party where liberal rhetoric on racial issues has become more standard, swing voters have a choice of voting for a Democrat (black or not black) who takes liberal stances on racial issues — or a Republican who does not.
In fact, we may already be in a new political environment, one where black politicians can afford to be more liberal on racial issues. Abrams is putting voting rights, specifically the idea that Republicans are making it harder for people of color to cast ballots, at the center of her political brand. That has traditionally been considered an issue more for a Sharpton-type (a black person who might be considered by Democratic Party elites to be unable to win a general election) than an Obama-type (a person perceived to be more “electable.”) But in today’s politics, it’s possible that Abrams can simultaneously lead the conversation on voting rights, remain a viable candidate for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination in 2020 or run for governor of Georgia again in 2022. For their part, Booker and Harris have described Trump as “racist,” a term Obama rarely used to describe his political opponents.
“If the trend continues and the Democratic Party continues to move to the left on racial issues, in 2028, or beyond, then you may have a different type of black candidate running,” Stout said.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

On Wednesday, after failing to qualify for the September debate, two-term New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand announced that she was ending her candidacy.
It’s not hard to see why Gillibrand dropped out — the writing was on the wall. She still hadn’t met the donor threshold for the September debate, and had only hit 2 percent in one qualifying poll (she needed three more). Her debate performances didn’t do much to help her stand out from the other candidates — even on women’s issues, which she had made the centerpiece of her campaign. And although her name recognition rose over the course of the campaign, she didn’t become better-liked.
Her poll numbers barely shifted, too. In the month after she announced she was running for president, she hit a high of 3 percent in one February poll, but she never reached 3 percent again.
In the end, Gillibrand just couldn’t convince women voters — or most voters for that matter — that she was their candidate. But why her candidacy never picked up steam was always a little bit of a mystery. Of course, she had some hurdles to overcome. Like the other women running for president, she faced voters’ biases against women candidates. She also had the baggage of sparking Democratic Party heavyweights’ ire after she called on former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken to resign when sexual harassment allegations against him came out in 2017.
On paper, though, Gillibrand’s campaign didn’t seem especially quixotic. She was on the national stage for more than a decade before throwing her hat in the ring, and established herself as a strong advocate for women’s rights issues such as paid family leave and sexual assault in the military. She was also explicitly pitching her candidacy toward groups like white college-educated suburban women, whose political enthusiasm had just helped sweep a record-breaking number of women into office in the 2018 midterms.
So Gillibrand’s biggest problem may have simply been that there wasn’t a clear base for her in the Democratic electorate — at least not one for which there wasn’t also fierce competition in the rest of the primary field. After all, she was running against a number of other women who are also strong on issues like abortion rights and equal pay. Without another signature issue to help her stand out, she often got lost in the melee of the primary.
For instance, when several states passed laws dramatically restricting abortion in May, Gillibrand seemed like she could have had a breakthrough moment. She even traveled to two of the states to hold rallies in support of abortion rights, and she called for a federal law that would stop state legislatures from passing limitations on abortion — but so did Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and even Cory Booker. In the second debate, Gillibrand tried again to seize the spotlight by taking Joe Biden to task for his position on a childcare tax credit in 1981 — but unlike Harris’s attack on Biden for his stance on school busing a month earlier, the moment didn’t really land.
In those moments and others, her rivals seemed to harness policies that were key to Gillibrand’s candidacy more effectively than she did. It was Harris, not Gillibrand, who grabbed headlines for her plan to penalize companies for failing to pay men and women equally. And in a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll, respondents said that Warren was best qualified to address gender equality, followed by Biden, Sanders and Harris — Gillibrand didn’t even crack the top 10.
In some ways, Gillibrand’s campaign may have also shown just how tricky outreach to women voters can be, even in a year where issues such as abortion and the #MeToo movement are prominent. Women make up about 60 percent of the Democratic base, but there isn’t a lot of evidence that they gravitate automatically toward female candidates because of their shared identity, or even because of shared priorities. In that Politico/Morning Consult poll, for instance, only 5 percent of Democratic women voters said that gender equality was a top voting priority. And Warren and Harris appear to be polling only very slightly better with women than men; that gap is actually bigger for Biden.
Finally, although Gillibrand said she had no regrets about calling for Franken’s resignation, it may have hurt her among donors and party elites. Her campaign at one point suggested that anger over her role in Franken’s departure was hurting her among major party donors. That may be true: Despite having been a formidable fundraiser in the past, she raised substantially less than others in the field. Moreover, unlike her fellow senators, who all drew the backing of political influencers from their home states, Gillibrand netted only one endorsement.
As the first woman to leave the race, Gillibrand’s departure is noteworthy, particularly since she could, in theory, have stuck around and tried to make it into the October debate — after all, the criteria to qualify isn’t changing. So her decision to drop out now may signal some strategic decision-making for candidates who are prominent within the party. and therefore have more to lose by staying in the race too long. It’s possible that even if the White House isn’t in the cards for Gillibrand this time, she may be thinking about running for another office, like governor of New York, and doesn’t want to fall out of grace with the party. Or she may be withdrawing with the goal of helping to pave the way for Harris or Booker — both of whom are friends.
The question now is whether other candidates follow Gillibrand’s lead. She is the sixth candidate to have dropped out this summer, and it’s possible that her departure could be a harbinger of more winnowing. Particularly for anyone else who is thinking about running for office in the future, and wants to stay on the Democratic Party’s good side by helping to narrow the field.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

408,000 men and women
A new study in the journal Science — the “largest ever to analyze the genetics of same-sex sexual behavior” — examined genetic data from 408,000 men and women and found that genetics does play some role in determining who has same-sex sex. It’s not the result of a single gene, but many genes that contribute some small effect. The Times also reported that several scientists who are part of the LGBTQ community at the Broad Institute, which led the research, “said they were worried the findings could give ammunition to people who seek to use science to bolster biases and discrimination against gay people.” [The New York Times]

During its failed establishment of a second headquarters in New York City, Amazon reportedly kept a “burn book” — “an eight-page, bullet-pointed, Calibri font testimony” of what the company saw as insults from politicians and labor leaders who opposed the deal. Maybe I’m a typeface nerd, but the thing that most bothers me about this news is the use of Calibri. [The Wall Street Journal]
405 police departments
Speaking of Amazon, Ring, its home-security company, published a map this week showing the police departments across the country with which it has signed deals. Ring has acknowledged active partnerships with 405 such departments. The deals vary, and include such things as police offering rebates to people in the community who buy Ring products and granting police “access to a portal they can use to request footage from Ring camera owners in their communities.” [Gizmodo]
3,000 applications
The Morris Animal Refuge in Philadelphia put out a call online recently for adoptees of a 26-pound (!) cat named BeeJay, a.k.a. Mr. B. Needless to say, given the collective preferences of the internet, the call went viral and some 3,000 applications were submitted. Mr. B did find a home, and the shelter is working with the foster family “to help resolve the cat’s health and behavioral issues so that they might eventually become his permanent home.” Good luck, big fella.

140 home runs
Records continue to fall in baseball’s latest home-run era. Most recently, the Minnesota Twins broke the record for most homers on the road, smacking two in the third inning yesterday against the Chicago White Sox for a total of 140. That previous record was 138, set by the San Francisco Giants in 2001. [Associated Press]

Poll(s) of the week
The deadline to make the third Democratic primary debate has passed, and thanks to harder qualifying rules, just 10 candidates made the stage. This, of course, was unwelcome news among candidates such as billionaire activist Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who were on the cusp of making the debate. Steyer needed just one more qualifying poll, and Gabbard needed two.
And this got us thinking: What would the debate stage look like if the list or type of eligible polls were different? Gabbard, in particular, has taken the Democratic National Committee to task for the specific pollsters included in its list of approved polling organizations, arguing that had the list of pollsters been expanded, she would have had at least 2 percent support in more than 20 polls conducted during the third debate qualification window. And in fairness to her, understanding how the DNC determines its list of approved polling organizations can be confusing. Gabbard did hit 2 percent in YouGov’s latest national survey sponsored by The Economist, but it didn’t count toward qualifying for the debate.
So to better understand how including different pollsters or relying on different pollster methodologies could affect who made the debate stage, we checked to see who would have qualified if:
all polls had been counted;
just polls from pollsters with a grade of at least B- or better, according to FiveThirtyEight’s Pollster Ratings (as this grade captures a mix of high-quality phone polls and respected online polls); and
only live phone interviews polls, which are often considered the gold standard in polling.
And in this thought exercise, we also kept many of the DNC’s requirements for the third debate, meaning we also included only polls released between June 28 and Aug. 28 — and only counted a candidate as qualified if he or she hit 2 percent support in four polls and attracted the support of 130,000 individual donors (including at least 400 individual donors in at least 20 states).1 We also adhered to the DNC’s rules that limit qualifying polls to national and early-state surveys2 and that said two polls by the same pollster in the same geography can’t be counted.3
OK, so first up: Who would have made the stage in our most generous scenario where all polls are counted? Well, maybe not as many candidates as you’d expect given the parameters. Gabbard and Steyer would make the stage with nine and seven polls, respectively. And author and motivational speaker Marianne Williamson comes a little closer to making it with two qualifying polls. (She also has met the donor requirement.) But this still leaves out seven candidates that FiveThirtyEight considers “major” as well as the candidates who have dropped out since the second debate.
What if all polls had been counted for the third debate?

We adhered to the DNC’s donor requirements and polling support threshold. To qualify for the third debate under the DNC’s rules, a candidate had to reach 2 percent in at least four national or early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations and needed at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors in at least 20 states.

So, OK — what about the scenario in which we limit our scope to pollsters with at least a B- grade, according to our pollster ratings? It makes sense that the DNC would want to limit at least some of the pollsters included. So we chose pollsters that are still high quality, but our list of pollsters ends up being a little more expansive than the list of DNC-approved pollsters. And under this scenario, the same 12 candidates would make the stage as in the “all polls” scenario, but it’s a much closer cutoff — Steyer would have ended up with exactly four qualifying polls and Gabbard five — just one fewer than former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro.

On the other hand, what if the DNC had been more — not less — strict with its requirements? For instance, what if the DNC had chosen to just use pollsters that use live phone interviews? Yes, these polls are facing many challenges right now, including low response rates and high costs, but they remain the best performing type of poll. So if the DNC had limited qualification to these types of polls, the number of debate participants would have actually shrunk from 10 candidates to nine. The odd man out would be Castro, who would have ended up with only three qualifying polls, ahead the two for Gabbard and Steyer.

So big picture, you could say the exact DNC rules don’t make a huge difference — most of the same set of candidates makes it on stage regardless. Of course, for the individual candidates on the edge of qualification, that give or take is everything. Suffice it to say, the rules matter quite a bit to them. And in this case, there’s an argument to be made that the DNC’s list of eligible pollsters helped make or break qualification for those candidates on the bubble — Gabbard and Steyer in particular.
Other polling bites
New polling from Politico/Morning Consult suggests that Democrats prefer “Medicare for All” to building on the Affordable Care Act. The survey found that 65 percent of Democratic primary voters were either “much more likely” or “somewhat more likely” to back a presidential candidate who supported a single-payer health care system like Medicare for All over “preserving and improving” the ACA. Just 13 percent said such a position would make them “much less likely” or “somewhat less likely” to support such a candidate. Among all voters, 53 percent supported a Medicare for All-type health system compared to 34 percent who opposed it.
A new report from the Pew Research Center found that 61 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 38 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. And though Pew found stark partisan divides over abortion policy, it did find evidence that there was more support for policies advocated by the Democratic Party (42 percent) than the Republican Party (32 percent) – though 24 percent said they don’t agree with either party’s policies.
In a recent report on trust, media and democracy, Gallup and the Knight Foundation found that Americans are at least somewhat worried about local news organizations being consolidated under large media companies, especially if the parent company had strong political views. Sixty-six percent said they would be “very” concerned that the political views of the parent company “would influence the fairness of news coverage,” and 26 percent said they would be “somewhat” concerned. Large majorities also said they were worried about the inclusion of more news from outside the local area and less investment in news gathering and reporting.
Sen. Bernie Sanders said last week that he would hold companies accountable for their role in climate change, and YouGov Blue/Data for Progress found that about 62 percent of voters would support holding energy producers legally liable “if it could be proven that they misled the public about the consequences of climate change.” Another 20 percent opposed the idea. And perhaps unsurprisingly, support for the idea fell along partisan lines — 77 percent of Democrats supported the idea as did 63 percent of independents, while 39 percent of Republicans supported it.
Ahead of Labor Day, Gallup released a survey on labor unions in the United States, finding that 64 percent of Americans approve of labor unions; that is one of the highest approval ratings in the past 50 years. Since the late 1960s, approval of labor unions has mostly hovered below 60 percent.
Pro-Brexit Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently announced that the United Kingdom’s parliamentary session would be suspended until mid-October, not long before the Oct. 31 deadline for the U.K. to agree to a managed transition to leave the European Union. Johnson’s move gives members opposed to exiting the EU without an agreement less time to maneuver against a “no deal” Brexit, and a new poll from YouGov found that 47 percent of Britons oppose Johnson’s decision, while 27 percent support it.
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 54.2 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president, while 41.3 percent approve (a net approval rating of -12.9 points). At this time last week, 41.5 percent approved and 54.0 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -12.5 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 42.5 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.4 percent, for a net approval rating of -10.9 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.7 percentage points (46.4 percent to 39.7 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 6.3 points (46.2 percent to 39.9 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 5.9 points (46.1 percent to 40.2 percent).",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Since he came into the NFL in 2008, Jackson is 17th overall in receptions and 15th in touchdown catches.
But Jackson, now with Philadelphia, has led the NFL four times in yards per receptions, including last year for the Buccaneers at age 32. That’s more than any other player in NFL history.1 And his electrifying speed seems to dramatically enhance his team’s overall passing game. Having Jackson in uniform has boosted the yards per pass play of his teams. And when he’s gone, his former teams have quickly lost these games. That bad news for Tampa Bay, Jackson’s team last year, which had the 23rd best season in the statistic since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger.
Jackson’s newest quarterback noticed quickly that Jackson’s ability to take the top off the defense by getting behind the secondary makes the rest of the field easier to attack. Defenses have no choice but to play deeper.
“(This) takes pressure off all the other guys,” Carson Wentz said. “He’ll open up a lot of things underneath, we truly believe. … He just threatens defenders in a different way.”
Still, teams seem to have a hard time reconciling Jackson’s team value with his often underwhelming personal statistics. Since he broke into the league, he’s been on four squads, if you count his two stints with Philadelphia.
Jackson’s nomadic career makes it easier to quantify his impact. This effect can be seen at the team level when looking at how they perform during Jackson’s stay there compared with before as well as immediately after he leaves.

The numbers in Jackson’s last year with his teams are especially noteworthy. Among all teams since 1970 — that’s out of 1,445 team seasons in the period — they rank 57th (2013 Philadelphia), 32nd (2016 Washington) and 23rd (2018 Tampa Bay) in yards per pass play.2 This means each one finished in the 95th percentile or better.
Each of Jackson’s teams immediately gained in passing efficiency once he arrived. And both Philadelphia and Washington significantly declined once he left, by nearly 1 yard net per pass play. To put that into context, ranking last year’s teams by that measure, just 0.9 net yards per attempt separated the ninth-ranked Colts (6.7) and the 25th-ranked Lions (5.8). Those teams were 10-6 and 6-10, respectively, which is not surprising given that teams that win the yards-per-pass-play stat by any margin have won about 74 percent of games since the merger, according to my reporting for The Wall Street Journal.
Of course, it’s possible that these teams became more prolific at passing coincidentally upon Jackson’s arrival, via coaching, play-calling, quarterback performance or the skills of the team’s other receivers. Jackson has struggled with durability during his career, missing nine games in his first stint with the Eagles, eight with Washington and six with the Buccaneers. So if there is a significant Jackson effect, it should be apparent when looking at his team’s performance when he plays versus when he’s inactive. And it is:

Jackson’s active-and-inactive effect is even more pronounced than the difference before and after he joined his teams, at 1.03 yards per pass play.
Not surprisingly, given the impact of yards per pass play on wins and losses, Jackson’s teams with him inactive are 8-15 (.348 win percentage) compared with 75-76-2 (.497) when he plays.
It’s also possible that the effect Jackson seems to be creating for his team is really just a result of his own efficiency. After all, he’s averaged 9.7 yards on the 1,057 passes he’s been thrown in his career, counting incompletions.
But last year, Jackson’s ability to threaten defenses deep did seem to significantly benefit his team’s primary receiver. Mike Evans averaged a career-best 11.0 yards every time a pass was thrown his way, a startling 2.4 yards greater than his prior season high (in 2014). And Evans was thrown the ball 138 times, nearly twice as frequently as Jackson (74 targets). For Washington, Jackson’s tight end teammate Vernon Davis (2016) boosted his yards per target by over 3.0 yards from the prior year. And another Washington tight end, Jordan Reed, averaged 7.8 yards per target with Jackson from 2014 to 2016 and since has dropped to just 6.5. During Jackson’s last stint in Philly, Riley Cooper averaged 9.9 yards per target, 10th-best in the league that year. But the next year, without Jackson, that collapsed to 6.1. Cooper has been out of the NFL since 2015.
The question now is whetherJackson can be expected to maintain his fleet feet entering his age-33 season. The Eagles sure seem to think so, awarding him a three-year, $27.9 million contract this offseason with more than half the money guaranteed.
Jackson’s 18.9 yards per catch in his age-32 season was third-most since the merger (minimum 40 catches). The average age-33 season of the other seven receivers with more than 17.0 yards at age 32 was 53 catches for 769 yards. Two of them, Irving Fryar and Frank Lewis, subsequently made the Pro Bowl. Another, Steve Smith, had two 1,000-yard seasons. But unlike Jackson, none of these other seven receivers led the NFL in yards per reception even once, never mind a record-setting four times.
While there’s no way to know for certain the player the Eagles have, there’s little question about what Jackson has been so far in his career.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-time-to-stop-pretending-that-the-nfl-preseason-isnt-pointless/,2019-08-30,,,features,"Aug. 30, 2019",It’s Time To Stop Pretending That The NFL Preseason Isn’t Pointless,Ty Schalter,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"The curtain fell on the 2019 NFL preseason Thursday night — and judging by the volleys of rotten produce hurled at it by fans, writers and coaches, the NFL may never want to stage that show the same way again.
For decades, it’s felt like the NFL has had a predictable rhythm to how (and how often) starters play. A little in the first game, then a little more, and then the third preseason game is the “dress rehearsal,” when coaches game-plan, starters start, and the fans who paid full price for tickets get treated to something resembling their team. In the context of meaningless August football, this one game on the preseason schedule was the closest thing fans got to the real thing. The fourth preseason game, in which starters rarely played, has been a forgivable afterthought.
But the ugly, pointless football played Thursday night felt unforgivable — because the players fans pay to see barely played in the first three games, either. Even the last bastion of NFL preseason relevance seems to be vanishing. This year’s “dress rehearsals” hardly lived up to their billing. Carolina Panthers starting quarterback Cam Newton left the game after a minor injury. Almost all of the Green Bay Packers’ starters were held out. Houston starter Deshaun Watson got sacked to start the team’s first possession, the Texans lost starting running back Lamar Miller for the season on the next play, then Watson got sacked again, fumbled the ball and headed for the bench without throwing a pass. Indianapolis Colts starter Andrew Luck retired before taking a single preseason rep.
If teams are comfortable going the entire preseason with their starting quarterbacks barely taking the field, the league’s case for making their fans spend the time and money to watch these games is significantly weakened. Perhaps as no surprise, calls to reduce the number of preseason games are now coming from everywhere, from fans on Twitter to major news outlets. It feels like all of a sudden, the whole NFL-watching world has given up on the preseason.
Of course, calls for a shortened NFL preseason are nothing new. Analyst John Clayton called for it in The Washington Post earlier this month — almost two decades after he wrote for ESPN that players’ union representatives had already been pushing for it “for years.”
The year after Clayton wrote that ESPN article, the NFL expanded to 32 teams. Fourteen of those teams’ eventual Week 1 starters led their squad in preseason pass attempts. Even as their union reps were arguing that a four-game preseason was at least one game more than anybody needed, stars like Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Daunte Culpepper, Brett Favre and Peyton Manning were out there taking more reps than anybody on their team.
During that 2002 season, 34.4 percent of preseason passes were thrown by quarterbacks who would go on to start Week 1. A decade later, starters’ share of the workload was about the same. But from 2012 to last season, their leaguewide share of pass attempts dropped by 36.5 percent.
This season, it fell even more steeply. Projected Week 1 starters (via OurLads) accounted for just 11.7 percent of pass attempts.1 That’s a 43 percent drop in one year, after more than a decade of consistently giving fans at least a decent look at the most important player on the team.
The same pattern shows up when we look at how many starters have led their team in preseason attempts — and how many starters have brought up the rear. In 2002, 14 of 32 teams’ starting quarterbacks led their team in preseason pass attempts, and in 2012, 13 starters still led their team in preseason throws. But since 2015, no more than three have.
For most of the 2000s and into the middle of this decade, the number of starters who threw the fewest preseason passes on their teams stayed in the low single digits. Last year, it was a full half of the league’s starting QBs.
This year, no starters have thrown the most passes of anyone else on their team, and 22 threw the fewest. In just seven years, we’ve gone from almost half the league mostly playing their starters to over two-thirds the league barely playing them at all.
There’s also reason to believe that the decline of starting QB reps across the league this preseason is not a coincidence. The NFL and its players’ union have begun negotiations for their next collective bargaining agreement, and truncating the preseason is reportedly a major negotiating topic. In that context, coaches and players are incentivized to force the owners’ hands.
Last week, with Luck likely to sit out the third preseason game, Colts head coach Frank Reich and Chicago Bears head coach Matt Nagy texted before the game and reached a mutual I-won’t-play-my-guys-if-you-won’t truce. A similar detente was reached between Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson and Baltimore Ravens skipper John Harbaugh after their week of joint practices.
In fact, joint practice sessions seem to be where the starters are getting all the reps they’ve been giving up.
“I think [joint practices are] the trend. I think that’s where we’re going. I think that’s the way the league is heading,” Pederson said in a recent press conference. “As coaches, we get to set the situation and control the environment, and sometimes you don’t get those in games. You don’t get that situation in a game, and this way we can control that and work on specific things and get some really good work done with our starters.”
That all makes sense: If a coach really wants to work on the two-minute offense, a preseason game offers no guarantee that a team will even get in a two-minute situation. The same is true for any other situation, matchup or personnel package. What doesn’t make sense, though, is charging fans full price to watch an uncontrolled scrimmage between a bunch of players who likely won’t even make their respective teams.
On Monday, Texans head coach Bill O’Brien suggested that fans could whet their appetite for starter-on-starter action by the league televising joint practices in lieu of two preseason games:

If the coaches, players and fans all feel like the risk of injury has outstripped the value of playing the games, there’s no viable path forward for the four-game preseason. Only one question remains: Whether the coaches, players and fans can persuade the owners to get on a different path.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-movement-to-skip-the-electoral-college-may-take-its-first-step-back/,2019-08-29,,,features,"Aug. 13, 2019",The Movement To Skip The Electoral College May Take Its First Step Back,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,Electoral College,"UPDATE (Aug. 29, 2019, 2:33 p.m.): On Thursday, the Colorado secretary of state certified that the effort to put Colorado’s National Popular Vote law to a public vote had indeed gathered enough signatures to do so. The referendum will now appear on the 2020 ballot.


In March, the state of Colorado handed a historic win to opponents of the Electoral College by becoming the first purple state to sign on to the National Popular Vote interstate compact. Next November, however, it could make history yet again by becoming the first state to renege on the agreement.
As we’ve written previously, states that join the National Popular Vote compact agree to cast their electoral votes for the presidential candidate who wins the most votes nationwide — not necessarily the candidate who carries the state. And the compact only goes into effect once states worth 270 electoral votes (a majority in the Electoral College) have joined, thus ensuring that its signatories have enough electoral votes to guarantee that the national popular vote winner becomes president. Currently, 15 states plus the District of Columbia, together worth 196 electoral votes, have ratified the compact.
Four of those states, including Colorado, joined the National Popular Vote movement just this year, but it remains a controversial issue — for example, it recently failed to pass in Maine and was vetoed in Nevada. And opponents in Colorado were upset enough about its passage that they are now actively trying to repeal the law. Earlier this month, the organization Coloradans Vote said it submitted more than 227,198 signatures to the Colorado secretary of state in an effort to subject the law to voter referendum in the 2020 election. With that number of signatures, chances are very good it will make the ballot, making it the first time voters in any state will vote directly on the National Popular Vote compact.
According to the Colorado secretary of state’s office, the 227,198 signatures are likely the most ever submitted for a statewide ballot initiative in Colorado — certainly the most since at least 2001. Now, it’s typical for about 20 percent of signatures to be thrown out during the verification process. But because the referendum needs only 124,632 valid signatures to qualify, up to 45 percent of them could be tossed and the measure would still make the ballot. (The secretary of state’s office will announce whether it has done so by Aug. 30.)
So the real question becomes whether voters will reject the legislature’s law and make Colorado the first state to exit the National Popular Vote compact. And polls suggest it would be a competitive election! Nationally, 53 percent of Americans said the popular vote should determine the president, and 43 percent said the Electoral College should, according to an April/May NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Unsurprisingly, given that almost every state government to pass the National Popular Vote compact was completely controlled by Democrats, there is a wide partisan gap on the question: 79 percent of Democrats preferred the popular vote, while 74 percent of Republicans favored the Electoral College.
Given that Colorado is roughly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, I’d expect support to break down about the same in the Centennial State as it does nationally. The only poll about the National Popular Vote law I could find in Colorado was a March survey from Republican pollster Magellan Strategies that found 47 percent of likely 2020 voters would vote to affirm the National Popular Vote law and 47 percent would vote to repeal it. However, even if those numbers are too rosy for the repeal effort, I would still expect support for the law to decrease as opponents prosecute the case against the National Popular Vote, so even a lead of, say, 10 points (akin to the national breakdown) would not be secure. This could be one of the most closely watched ballot measures of the 2020 cycle.
CORRECTION (Aug. 16, 2019, 10:50 a.m.): A previous version of this article incorrectly characterized the National Popular Vote compact referendum as likely to make the 2020 ballot in Colorado. If the referendum passes, it would not repeal the National Popular Vote law. The referendum campaign would put the law itself up for a vote, so Colorado would have to vote “no” on the referendum in order to exit the compact.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

And while the field is beginning to winnow, and a few key endorsements have been locked up in some of the early voting states, interviews with early-state Democratic Party activists I’m speaking with for my book on the future of the party suggest that many have yet to decide whom they’ll champion in 2020. Nonetheless, there is a growing belief among the activists I’ve talked with that members of their community are starting to lean toward Sen. Elizabeth Warren even though no activist has yet committed to backing her.
This is the fifth installment of my series where I interview Democratic activists in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, Nevada and Washington, D.C.,1 to better understand who engaged party members in early-primary states are backing for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. I’m interviewing these activists every two months, as research has shown that these activists can be highly influential in deciding who will be the party’s nominee. So in these interviews, I’m trying to learn two main things. First, which of these activists are already committed to a candidate. And second, if they’re not committed to anyone, which candidates are they actively considering. In April, I also started asking respondents who they didn’t want to see as the nominee, and throughout this process I’ve been asking them who they thought other Democrats in their community might be leaning toward as a way to get further insight on how the invisible primary is unfolding.
First up, the activists who have committed to backing a specific presidential candidate. Of the 29 activists who shared their candidate preferences with me in August, 11 say they have made up their minds. (That’s up from nine two months ago, though because not every activist I contact responds to every round of interviews, it’s possible this change is related to who chooses to respond rather than a true change in how many activists are committed.) And of those 11, three support Sen. Cory Booker and three support Sen. Bernie Sanders. As for the other five activists, they’re each backing a different candidate: former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who has since dropped out. (Some activists had pledged support for candidates in previous interview rounds, but because they didn’t respond to this round, they were not included here.)
Among this group of committed activists, only two of these endorsements are new. One respondent pledged their support to Sanders, saying, “Bernie is the O.G. when it comes to progressive policy. Why support Bernie light when you can get the real thing?” The other new endorsement was for Inslee from an activist who cited Inslee’s focus on climate change and years of experience in Congress and as governor as reasons for their support.
I also asked all the uncommitted activists who they’re considering supporting. Fewer activists were undecided in this round than in previous rounds, so the “considering” numbers are somewhat lower than in previous surveys,2 but the relative positions of the candidates haven’t changed much. There is a top tier of candidates who a number activists are considering, which consists of Booker, Buttigieg, Biden, Warren and Sen. Kamala Harris, each of whom is being considered by roughly a third of activists who responded to this round of interviews. Harris and Buttigieg sit at the top of this group with 38 percent (11 activists) each. Booker was at the top of this list in the last survey, but is now third at 31 percent (9 activists). (In the table below, I combined the number of respondents considering each candidate with the number committed to each candidate to show their total support.)

Respondents were asked about the 23 commonly mentioned candidates listed above, but they were also provided space to write in candidates not listed.
Source: SETH MASKET, “LEARNING FROM LOSS: THE DEMOCRATS, 2016-2020”
As for the next tier of candidates, between 14 and 21 percent of activists I spoke to (four to six people) say they are considering Sanders, Castro, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock or Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. The other candidates in the table are being considered by no more than three people each. Interestingly, activists who had not yet committed to anyone listed a median of four candidates this month when asked who they were still considering, down from 6.5 in the June survey. That may suggest that activists are starting to whittle down the list of candidates they might support.
As for the candidates activists do not want to see become the Democratic nominee, the rankings haven’t changed much. Although about a fifth of activists I interviewed in this round were committed to or considering Sanders (three people committed and three more considering), even more did not want him to be the nominee — 59 percent (17 out of 29 respondents) said they were opposed to seeing him win. And over half of the activists I interviewed also did not want Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam, author Marianne Williamson, former Rep. John Delaney or Rep. Seth Moulton as the nominee. But one candidate whose fortunes might be changing is entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who went from one of the top five least-liked candidates in my June survey to the 12th least-liked candidate in August, putting him alongside less polarizing candidates like O’Rourke and Klobuchar. This hasn’t meant Yang is gaining supporters (two activists are now considering him, the same number as in June), but at the very least, several of the activists who were previously put off by him are no longer openly opposed to his candidacy.

Since December, I have also asked respondents which candidate they think Democrats active in their communities lean toward, regardless of their own preferences. I haven’t published the results for this question before, as estimates for have bounced around a lot, but in this survey I noticed that Warren is the only candidate on a clear upward trajectory. In my first three surveys from December to April, few respondents3 thought that Democrats in their area were leaning toward Warren. But by June, five of 28 (18 percent) activists I spoke to said people in their community were leaning toward Warren. And this month, nine of 27 (33 percent) said they thought people in their community were leaning toward Warren, putting her well ahead of all other candidates. This tracks with her rise in recent polling and her strong showing in some early voting states. So even though no activist has committed to Warren, they now seem to view her candidacy as viable and believe it has momentum.
In sum, a majority of the activists I’ve been interviewing are still uncommitted, although there are signs that the field is winnowing. Many activists are only interested in a relatively small group of candidates — Biden, Booker, Buttigieg, Harris or Warren. And Sanders remains a factional candidate among the activists I’ve interviewed, with a respectable number of supporters but also a large number of detractors. Additionally, although none of my respondents have committed to Warren, a third are convinced that others in their community prefer her, so it’s possible that in the coming months, more activists will say they are either committed to Warren or considering her. As for my next survey, it will be done in early October, by which time the September debate may have narrowed down the field because it’s so much harder for candidates to qualify for the third debate than it was for the first two. It will be interesting to see whether this forces some of the activists’ hands and gets them to commit to one candidate (or change their mind).",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

We’ll have one night of debating with the 10 candidates marked below.


One or two nights — that is the overriding question for the third Democratic primary debate, which is scheduled for Sept. 12 and, possibly, Sept. 13. As of Monday afternoon, exactly 10 presidential contenders have qualified to participate, and if that number stands, all 10 will be on stage at the same time and the debate will be confined to a single night. But if more than 10 candidates make it by Wednesday’s deadline, the hosts — ABC News and Univision, in partnership with the Democratic National Committee — plan to have two nights of debate, conducting a random draw this Thursday to determine each night’s lineup. While we watch for last-minute surveys to drop, here’s a look at where the candidates currently stand.

*For candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight.
To qualify for the third debate, a candidate must reach 2 percent in at least four national or early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations and must have at least 130,000 unique donors, including at least 400 donors in at least 20 states. Information released by campaigns is used to determine whether a candidate has hit the donor threshold. If a campaign announced it had reached 130,000 donors but did not say whether it had at least 400 donors in 20 states, we assumed that it had met the latter requirement as well. Candidates will have to prove to the DNC that they have met the donor requirements.
Sources: Polls, Media Reports
As a reminder, making the debate requires candidates to attract both 2 percent support in four qualifying national or early-state polls released between June 28 and Aug. 28 and collect contributions from 130,000 unique donors (including at least 400 individual donors in at least 20 states).1 Since our last update, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro became the 10th candidate to qualify for the stage when he got his fourth poll on Aug. 20. The latest qualifying survey — a national poll from Monmouth University released this afternoon — did not add any new candidates to the stage, but it did give author and motivational speaker Marianne Williamson her first qualifying poll. Outside of the 10 qualifiers, four other active candidates now have gotten at least one qualifying survey — Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, billionaire activist Tom Steyer and Williamson. Of those on the bubble, Steyer is closest to making the stage while the other three need more help.
Despite only announcing his bid in early July, Steyer has quickly put himself in a position to make the third debate by using his massive personal wealth and the contact lists of his grassroots organizations Need To Impeach and NextGen. Steyer announced earlier this month that he had accrued 130,000 individual donors, and he has already spent millions on digital and television ads, primarily in early-voting states like Iowa and South Carolina. So it’s perhaps unsurprising that all three of Steyer’s qualifying polls are from those two early states while he has yet to register more than 1 percent in a national qualifying poll.
As for the candidates that could fall short of making the debate, some, like Gabbard, are displeased with the qualification rules. Gabbard’s campaign has claimed that she’s received at least 2 percent support in more than 20 polls released since the second debate, but only two of those surveys are from pollsters sanctioned by the DNC. Among her campaign’s complaints are that the DNC’s rules about which polls will be counted aren’t very consistent: Some highly-rated polling organizations were left off the DNC’s list, and some surveys were excluded despite being sponsored by notable media organizations. For example, state-level polls conducted by online pollster YouGov on behalf of CBS News have been counted — which is approved by the DNC — while national YouGov polls sponsored by The Economist have not.
Williamson announced last week that she had surpassed the donor threshold for the third debate, and today’s Monmouth poll gave her one qualifying poll. She still needs three more surveys to qualify, which is unlikely to happen before Wednesday’s deadline, so it’s unclear what her next steps might be. Gillibrand, too, is hoping for three more qualifying polls. The New York senator might get to 130,000 donors by Wednesday — she announced last week that she had 115,000 — but she might not even make it that far. Some of her former staffers have said that she should abandon her presidential bid, and in an interview with the Washington Post last week, Gillibrand said she was receptive to the idea of serving as vice president. So it’s possible the end is nigh for her campaign.
Of the remaining six candidates that FiveThirtyEight considers “major,” none appear to be remotely close to qualifying for the third debate. And the question now is whether they, too, will join the recent wave of campaign departures, which has included three candidates in the last two weeks. All the candidates can do now is wait and see if any polls will be released before the Wednesday deadline. And for debate watchers, a last-minute poll could make the difference between one debate night with 10 candidates and two smaller, separate events with five or six candidates on stage. Time will tell.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

$572 million
In a “landmark ruling” in a lawsuit relating to the opioid crisis, an Oklahoma judge ruled that Johnson & Johnson must pay the state $572 million. The corporation, the state argued, contracted with poppy growers in Tasmania and “supplied 60 percent of the opiate ingredients that drug companies used for opioids like oxycodone.” A Johnson & Johnson subsidiary has also produced its own opioid pill and a fentanyl patch. [The New York Times]
$8.49 12-piece combo meal
Beginning today at a single location in Smyrna, Georgia, Kentucky Fried Chicken is testing an offering of meatless “chicken” in partnership with the “plant-based food purveyor” Beyond Meat. A 12-piece combo meal will go for $8.49, a discount from the typical $12.99 of an actual-chicken 12-piece combo meal. The main ingredient is pea protein. It’s a brave new world. [Yahoo Finance]
7 northern white rhino eggs
This weekend, scientists in Italy took frozen sperm previously removed from two of the planet’s last living male northern white rhinos (both of whom have since died) and used it to try to artificially fertilize eggs taken from the last two living females of the species. They hope to create as many as seven embryos, with a goal of creating a herd of at least five of the animals that could be returned to their natural habit. What did you do over the weekend? [Associated Press]
$22 million
Leaders at the G-7 summit have agreed to provide “logistical and financial support,” including $22 million, to fight the widespread wildfires in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said the plan treated the country “as if we were a colony or no man’s land.” Environmentalists have blamed Bolsanaro and his “anti-environmental rhetoric” for the drastically increased number of fires. [BBC]
10 candidates
As of yesterday afternoon, 10 Democratic presidential candidates had qualified for the third primary debate, meeting both the polling and donor requirements set by the Democratic National Committee. If that number stands, the 10 will all take the stage together. If the number grows, however, the debate’s hosts will split candidates up over two nights of rhetorical combat, “conducting a random draw this Thursday to determine each night’s lineup,” my colleague Geoffrey Skelley writes. [FiveThirtyEight]
3 floors
“Evidence of bedbugs” has been discovered on all three floors of the newsroom of The New York Times. Having had bedbugs in the city myself, I sympathize deeply and have therefore resisted my nearly-as-deep urges to make a joke here. [Slate]

$30,000 party
Attorney General William Barr booked a 200-person holiday party at the Presidential Ballroom of President Trump’s Washington, D.C., hotel — a party “that is likely to deliver Trump’s business more than $30,000 in revenue,” according to a contract obtained by The Washington Post. A Justice Department official said that the booking was made only after it was found that other hotels were already full up, and that the point of the party “wasn’t to curry favor with the president.” [The Washington Post]
50,000 immigrants
According to department officials and a letter from a congresswoman, the Trump administration will pull $271 million from the Department of Homeland security to fund “immigration detention space and temporary hearing locations for asylum-seekers.” More than $150 million of what ICE would gain will come from FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund. The additional money would allow ICE to detain nearly 50,000 immigrants at any given time. [NBC News]
29.6 and 34.5 percent
Jalopnik asked ride-share drivers to send in receipts showing what riders were charged and how much drivers kept. The publication received records for 14,756 fares, and its analysis found that, of the drivers who sent in breakdowns of all of their fares in a given period, on average Uber kept 29.6 percent of the fares and Lyft kept 34.5 percent. Those figures were 10.6 percentage points and 8.5 percentage points higher, respectively, than the companies’ reported numbers. [Jalopnik]
719 days
A Boeing X-37B spaceplane belonging to the Air Force set a record this week for the longest time in orbit around Earth — 719 days. Few know what it’s doing up there, however, as the mission’s details are classified. The Air Force’s description says its goals are “reusable spacecraft technologies for America’s future in space and operating experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth.” [Gizmodo]
3.5 million people
Indonesia’s president has announced that the country will move its capital from “sinking and polluted” Jakarta (which has a population of 30 million people in its greater metro area) to an as-yet-unnamed city in “sparsely populated” East Kalimantan province on Borneo island (population 3.5 million). The relocation will reportedly take as long as a decade and cost some $32.5 billion. [The Associated Press]
+54 favorability
Now that voters have had somewhat of a chance to learn and think about the passel of Democratic presidential candidates, my colleague Nathaniel Rakich checked in on those candidates’ favorability in the eyes of voters. According to an average of national polls in August, Elizabeth Warren tops the list with a net favorability of +54. Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris follow with net favorables of +52, +51 and +40, respectively. Only 159 days until the Iowa caucuses! [FiveThirtyEight]

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Wednesday marked the last day candidates could qualify for the Sept. 12 Democratic primary debate, and in the end there were 21 DNC-approved polls, with 10 candidates able to hit 2 percent support in four qualifying national or early-state polls1 and reach 130,000 unique donors (including at least 400 individual donors in at least 20 states).2
The ten candidates who have qualified are: Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang.
So now that we have one debate with the top 10 candidates, how’s that change the dynamics? Who could it help and who could it hurt?
micah (Micah Cohen, managing editor): No. 1 benefiter: Us. Back-to-back debate nights are horrible.
geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, elections analyst): Yeah, now I get to watch UVA raise its national championship banner on Friday instead.
natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): Yeah, it helps people who were hoping to make plans on Friday night. And — just full disclosure here — we think it’s pretty cool that the network we work for, ABC News, is gonna get to host the first debate where all the major candidates are on the same stage.
sarahf: Now, now — I meant this when I tweeted it earlier — it goes beyond self interest:


Welp, that was pretty anticlimactic, but I'm actually pretty excited for one debate night (and not just for self-interested reasons). Warren & Biden have yet to face off — and in theory, these are the 10 candidates voters are most interested in: https://t.co/nFc682fqn8
— Sarah E. Frostenson (@sfrostenson) August 28, 2019

micah: But Sarah, I assume you wanted a more substantive answer that readers will actually be interested in?
sarahf: Yeah, we’re finally about to watch the candidates people are (theoretically) most interested in!! And I, for one, am excited to see Warren and Biden go head-to-head.
What about you all?
micah: Yeah, that’s true. So maybe Democratic voters are the real beneficiaries.
natesilver: I’m not sure it helps voters, to be honest.
I think maybe it hurts voters.
What they could do instead is put all the good candidates on one night and then all the weird ones in a JV debate. That way, people who want to watch the weird candidates still can, but it doesn’t deprive them of the opportunity to see, say, Warren vs. Biden.
geoffrey.skelley: There were plenty of people in my Twitter mentions complaining that there should be two debates with smaller numbers. I think you arguably could have had Biden, Warren, Sanders, Harris and Buttigieg one night, and put the other five on the second night.
sarahf: Are we sure we think that’s a good idea? The JV debates were ridiculed on the GOP side during the 2016 primaries. I just think there’s no good way for the parties to handle the winnowing process, and the candidates had 21 polls to hit 2 percent in, so I’d argue these are the 10 candidates voters are most interested in hearing.
micah: OMG, we just got down to 10 candidates, and people are already complaining that that’s too many!!!?
geoffrey.skelley: In the context of one debate stage, yeah.
natesilver: It’s kind of been demonstrated by now that a candidate like Castro or Booker can have a pretty darn good night — and he or she is still overshadowed by what the 4-5 main candidates are doing.
Hell, have the JV debate first, and then have some system where whoever does best according to a poll of Democratic voters gets a seat on the second night.
geoffrey.skelley: Oh, now that’s fun.
micah: But this is certainly an improvement for voters over two 10-person debates.
Even by your logic, Nate.
sarahf: But OK … to get back on track …
geoffrey.skelley: Story of Sarah’s life as politics editor.
micah: OK, my 🔥 take …
This might also be the most obvious, conventional-wisdom take — but isn’t Biden presented with the most downside risk now that the focus gets tightened to 10 candidates?
Instead of having to worry about mainly one top-tier challenge (Harris or Bernie or whomever), he now risks getting outshone by any or all of them.
The assumption behind this, which might be wrong, is that Biden is a worse performer in these debates than the other top-tier candidates. Also, just as the front-runner, he has the most to lose.
natesilver: Doesn’t Biden actually get less speaking time, though, than if there had been two 6-person debates?
micah: Yes, so I guess that’s a plus for him?
But I would argue that the narrative power of being down to one stage and one debate (and thus constricting the number of “viable” candidates) outweighs that.
geoffrey.skelley: Especially since he’s the one candidate trying to stay within the time limits when talking on stage.
I think there’s merit to Micah’s case in that it’s in the interest of the other leading candidates to hit Biden, and now all three candidates who are more or less right behind Biden in the polls all get to attack him.
micah: Right, so the chances of a Warren-Biden dustup increase, but so do the chances of another Harris-Biden clash, or a Bernie-Biden or Buttigieg-Biden clash.
Or Beto-Biden!
geoffrey.skelley: Booker-Biden, too.
micah: Klobuchar-Biden!
natesilver: Not to be pedantic — OK, TO BE PEDANTIC — but I don’t think anybody is right behind Biden. He leads by double digits in the polling average.
Also, didn’t everyone go after Biden in the Detroit debate? That didn’t seem to move the needle much, though.
micah: But that’s the point — most of those people who went after Biden were “also-rans.”
To me, Warren going after Biden has more potential to hurt him than the pass-the-torch guy going after Biden.
Even Booker or Klobuchar going after Biden has more potential to hurt him than the more anonymous candidates.
geoffrey.skelley: RIP Eric Swalwell.
sarahf: I guess the flip side of Micah’s argument is that there isn’t necessarily an immediate upside for some of the lower-tier polling candidates like Klobuchar or Castro either.
But perhaps I’m not giving enough credit to how the dynamics of this debate will be different than the previous two.
natesilver: Yeah I think if you’re the Klob, you might actually want a night where it’s just you, Biden and some other rando candidates on stage.
micah: Nate, I’m not sure what argument you’re making.
natesilver: I’m not sure what argument any of us are making.
Look, if you think Warren’s gonna clean Biden’s clock, then it’s good for her that they’re finally on the same stage together.
I don’t think that’s good for, like, KLOBUCHAR though, because all the focus is gonna be on the Warren-Biden confrontation.
micah: The question here is how do the dynamics change from two 10-person debates with a mix of top-tier and lower-tier candidates each, to one stage with the top 10. It isn’t whether two six-person debates would be better for Biden.
natesilver: Nothing really matters except that Warren and Biden are gonna be on the same stage.
sarahf: 🔥
micah: Except maybe it’s bad for the middle-tier candidates too, such as Klobuchar? (As you said, Nate.)
natesilver: From Biden’s perspective, I think the options are ranked this way: 1) Don’t debate Warren 2) Debate Warren on a 10-person stage 3) Debate Warren on a six-person stage.
micah: And from the Castros, Yangs and Klobuchars of the field it’s the reverse? Right?
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, those three would have benefited from the two small five- or six-person debates. Now, they could be heavily overshadowed, but there still might be an opportunity on certain issues for one of them to break through — Castro on immigration, for example.
natesilver: Yeah, I think Castro or Klob would rather be part of a smaller debate against Biden, where everyone else is not ganging up on Biden, and certainly not where you have Warren around, who’s gonna command all of the attention.
micah: Agreement!
sarahf: OK … so who exactly stands to benefit from the dynamics of this debate?
natesilver: It’s good for Warren to be guaranteed a slot against Biden. Unless she blows it.
micah: And I would also argue that it’s good for the other top-tier candidates — Harris, Sanders and maybe Buttigieg.
sarahf: It’s certainly make or break for those three, but I’m not sure it’s good, given everything we’ve just said about the Castros, Yangs and Klobuchars of the field.
natesilver: I don’t think it matters much for Bernie either way; he’s always a highly competent, but not spectacular debater, and the circumstances don’t seem to matter much.
micah: That’s fair.
And it’s obviously good for Klobuchar, Castro et. al. in the sense that they made the debate, but they probably would have preferred two nights.
natesilver: Harris is interesting, though. She and Warren have NOT been on the same stage together.
Maybe Harris should go after Warren! Or Bernie!
micah: Warren busting Biden is maybe good for Harris?
natesilver: I think Warren busting Biden is better for Warren than it’s bad for Biden.
Because Biden’s already had one really shitty debate and one OK one and …. well, he’s still polling at 29 percent or whatever. I’m not sure his voters care that much or see the debate the same way that media folks like us do.
micah: So yeah, then maybe it doesn’t help Harris even if Warren gets the better of Biden.
natesilver: WHAT IF HARRIS GOES AFTER WARREN ON THE NATIVE AMERICAN STUFF?!?!? She can be pretty cut-throat.
geoffrey.skelley: With some of the overlap of college-educated voter support for Warren and Harris, you could make a case that Harris should think about going after Warren to win over more of those voters. But I guess I’m having some trouble seeing it. And yeah, no one has criticized Warren for claiming Native American ancestry yet — even though that might be her most obvious non-policy weakness. That could be explosive if it happened.
micah: So the goal there would be to try and win over some of the liberal, white, college-educated support Warren has?
natesilver: I mean, she needs some of Warren’s college-educated white support, and she needs some of Biden’s black support.
She needs both of those things, and right now she has neither, really.
micah: COME OUT FIRING AT EVERYONE!!!!
sarahf: Well, as we learned in our poll of the first debate, while the bulk of Harris’s new supporters came from those who supported Biden, she did also make inroads with voters who were supporting Warren and Buttigieg — so probably a fair amount of white, college-educated voters. And I think it’s definitely plausible that this happens again.

geoffrey.skelley: If Harris is the second choice for a fair number of Warren supporters, there’s an opportunity to convert them to her, too. But yeah, to Nate’s point, Harris really does need some more of Biden’s black support.
micah: And as you note, Sarah, we did find that Biden lost support after the first debate, and much of it went to Harris.

So you do wonder if, had Harris had followed up with a better second debate performance, whether more of that support would have stuck. Which is all to say that I’m not positive Biden’s ~30 percent is all that durable.
sarahf: But OK … is the field now just those 10 candidates? Or what happens to the other 10 candidates FiveThirtyEight considers “major?” Do we expect more dropouts? Or do we think many of the candidates will try and stick it out for the October debate, as the qualifying criteria isn’t changing?
geoffrey.skelley: Given her campaign’s irritation with the debate qualification rules, I think Tulsi Gabbard might stick around to see if she can make the October debate. Tom Steyer is also only one poll away from making the October debate, so he might just keep spending mountains of cash in the early states in the hopes of getting that survey. Marianne Williamson — who knows? But it’s hard to see any other candidates having a chance of making the October debate.
sarahf: Well, you say that, Geoff. But Zach Montellaro over at Politico made an argument earlier in August that the October debate stage could grow, not shrink, and while I’m not totally sure how much it could grow, I do think more than 10 candidates will qualify. So now, I think more candidates on the cusp will stay in the race in the hopes they make the cut.
geoffrey.skelley: Sure, the candidates who weren’t that far away from making the third debate probably want to see if they can get enough polls or donors (or both) to make the fourth one. But everyone else is pretty much done and dusted.
micah: So, if making that October debate is among the more important things at this point in the campaign, do we think Steyer and Gabbard potentially have the most staying power, among the people on the outside looking in for the September debate?
sarahf: I’d think so?
micah: BOLD!
sarahf: And then maybe we get one of these magical six-person debates you all keep talking about.
micah: I like it!
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, I’d say two smaller debate nights in October is quite possible because Steyer was so close to making it, and he can spend millions in Iowa and other early states to try to attract enough notoriety to get 2 percent in one more state-level poll.
natesilver: I mean, I guess Steyer is likely to qualify.
micah: I’m surprised more candidates didn’t at least try to outsmart the system in the way Steyer did.
natesilver: In the abstract, you’d think the DNC would consider putting all candidates on the same stage if there were, say, 11 of them. But it seemed to be pretty clear this time that they were drawing a bright line at 10.
sarahf: I still can’t believe Steyer spent more than $10 million on digital and television advertising since he announced he was running in July — that’s more than any other Democrat in the race and President Trump!!
natesilver: Yeah, are we really sure he’s a winner here, Micah?
He spent a shit-ton of money, he missed the first debate, and maybe he’ll make another debate in six weeks?
micah: Well, just given his overall prospects, I’d say him being currently more likely to make the October debate than Steve Bullock or whomever is a sign he did something smart?
Or maybe I just underrated him from the jump.
natesilver: It’s a sign that that system isn’t set up super well.
micah: Yes, that too.
natesilver: Granted, any system would be exploitable.
But, like, maybe the DNC should subtract X donors for every Y amount you spend,
such that you don’t actually get credit when the cost of fundraising exceeds the amount you receive.
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, there’ve been plenty of complaints that the debate qualification rules create perverse incentives, like spending more money to get the donors you need than the amount you actually pull in per donation.
sarahf: Well, I mean all the polls Steyer has qualified in have been early-state polls, right, Geoff?
So his design on dropping boatloads of money in early states wasn’t exactly misguided.
geoffrey.skelley: Right. He has three qualifying early-state polls and no national polls.
micah: Yeah, I don’t think it’s worked super well for Steyer. But it’s worked a little, at least.
But some rule, like the one Nate describes, would preclude that kind of “gamesmanship.”

sarahf: OK, so we think maybe Steyer and Gabbard stick it out until October, but what about everyone else? Anyone else want to make the bold prediction that Kirsten Gillibrand drops out before the October debate? [Editor’s note: After this chat concluded, Kirsten Gillibrand dropped out of the race, making her the sixth candidate to drop out this summer.]
Seriously, though, do we think a lot of the candidates now drop out?
micah: I’m sure a bunch will drop out.
geoffrey.skelley: I don’t think it’s completely bonkers to think that Gillibrand will drop out.
micah: Who’s most likely?
Yeah, definitely Gillibrand.
natesilver: Gillibrand is in the Jay Inslee category of “someone who has a future to lose.”
micah: Right. And political science research actually shows that having closer ties to the party — and thus having more to lose by staying in toooo long — correlates with dropping out.
natesilver: Although unlike Inslee, she doesn’t have anything to run for this year.
geoffrey.skelley: Gabbard has a congressional seat to defend, though.
But her primary is in August 2020, so she’s got plenty of time until the June candidate filing deadline.
natesilver: But there’s been talk of a primary challenge, right, Geoff?
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, Gabbard does have a legit primary challenger. So that might encourage her to drop out sooner rather than later, and go home to defend her seat.
micah: Maybe Tim Ryan drops out, too?
natesilver: I mean if we got a text alert right now saying Candidate X dropped out, the names we’d be most likely to guess are what? Gillibrand and Bennet-with-one-T?
micah: (😳 I thought Bennet already dropped out.)
But yeah.
geoffrey.skelley: Ryan actually might be able to wait a bit longer because, technically, he doesn’t have to drop out to seek reelection to his House seat (Ohio law permits candidates to run for president and Congress at the same time.) And Ryan had previously said he would file for reelection while continuing to run for president.
natesilver: Ryan does seem to be having fun on the campaign trail.


breaking: found my running mate pic.twitter.com/b1HsuwLUA7
— Tim Ryan (@TimRyan) August 28, 2019

And he’s getting to do a bunch of podcasts that he’s always wanted to be on and stuff.
geoffrey.skelley: Namaste, Nate.
sarahf: Seems #offbrand with the yoga shirts he’s also selling, but maybe I’m too close-minded.
micah: (Ryan is going for the Harry vote.)
sarahf: I also think Bullock could drop out soon, as I think he, too, could have a future in the party, too (if he wants it).
But maybe Bill de Blasio and Williamson are in for the long haul though, or at the very least, they don’t have the same incentives to drop out.
geoffrey.skelley: Could definitely see Williamson hanging around. Why not?
micah: Yes, let’s argue about de Blasio!
Does de Blasio have a future in the party to worry about? (Drops out.)
Or does he need his campaign to end in a better spot? (Stays in.)
natesilver: de Blasio? More like de Lusional.
I’m not sure why he ever ran in the first place.
sarahf: l o l
One theory I heard tossed about was he was interested in raising his profile for a cushy job at a think tank. But I don’t really get that logic, as I’m not sure how this has helped him.
natesilver: I literally laughed at my own joke out loud. Thank god not very many people are in the office today.
geoffrey.skelley: Maybe de Blasio was annoyed that all these relative nobodies, including the mayor of a small city in Indiana, were running for president — and thought: “Why not me?”
micah: lol
But I’m genuinely not sure if he’ll just stay in forever. Or “save face.” I tend to think the latter?
sarahf: Let’s wrap — the first one-night debate is upon us. Ten candidates have made it, and we’ve talked about who that helps, who that hurts and what we expect of those who haven’t made the stage. Any last thoughts?
micah: I guess my takeaway from this chat is that if everyone thinks that, of the people to have not made the debate, Steyer and Gabbard are the most likely people to make some noise … then I feel pretty comfortable saying that the 2020 Democratic primary is down to the 10 September debaters.
geoffrey.skelley: This is definitely an opportunity for Warren to separate herself from the rest of the pack — or to borrow from Nate’s tiers a bit, solidly position herself as a 1B to Biden’s 1A. Right now, there isn’t one obvious alternative to Biden.
micah: Yeah, and in terms of what happens on Sept. 12, I think Geoff is right. Can Warren solidify her a place as 1B?
And maybe also — between Harris and Buttigieg, can one of them push closer to that top three?
natesilver: Warren is already a 1B. This is about whether she can become a 1A.

On one hand, it was notable that former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh threw his hat into the ring this week, as he is a former Trump supporter of some stature (after leaving Congress, he became a nationally syndicated radio host). On the other, covering Walsh and his ilk as serious candidates implies that Trump is actually vulnerable to a primary challenge, and, well … he’s not.
There are plenty of reasons a primary challenge to Trump will probably fall flat. For starters, serious primary challenges are fairly rare; the last sitting president to be denied renomination was Chester Arthur in 1884. (Yes, there was Lyndon Johnson, but he retired before he could properly lose the nomination — although primary challengers probably had something to do with his decision.) Putting that aside, however, the biggest thing Trump has going for him is that he is extremely popular among Republicans — and that’s true in virtually every poll. For example, 88 percent of the GOP approves of his job performance in the latest Gallup poll. (True, Trump approval isn’t quite that high among voters who merely lean Republican, but even polls that incorporate leaners still give him overwhelming intraparty support — 82 percent in one recent poll.)
According to a CNN analysis from December, the only president in the last 70 years who was more beloved among members of his own party (as measured before the New Hampshire primary) was Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. And this is important because the only presidents who faced muscular primary challenges in the modern primary era1 were all under 75 percent approval with members of their own party: Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992. And yes, all three went on to lose the general election. This is not to say that primary challenges caused those losses; it could just be that only weak incumbents draw primary challengers. Trump is currently not weak among members of his own party (although he is unpopular overall), so it’s unclear if his primary challenges will foreshadow that same result.
Finally, head-to-head polls of the Republican primary give Trump massive leads over any primary challengers. He leads former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who was the first notable candidate to jump in the race, by anywhere from 60 to 85 points, and he even leads high-profile hypothetical challengers like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley by up to 80 points.
But these stubborn facts don’t appear to be deterring challengers — though it’s probably not a coincidence that those who might run are former politicians with no current office to lose. In addition to Walsh and Weld, former South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford is considering jumping in. But beating Trump may not be their real goal (Sanford, for example, has acknowledged that it would be close to impossible); instead, they may simply be hoping to spur a conversation about the party’s direction. Earlier this year, my colleague Geoffrey Skelley devised a scale for rating the “success” of presidential primary challengers on this front, from 1 (no-name candidates) to 5 — the (as-yet hypothetical) candidate who manages to successfully topple a sitting president. Right now, I would think that Walsh, Weld and potentially Sanford are somewhere between Levels 1 and 2. They are known commodities and could put together a professional campaign apparatus, but it seems unlikely that they will attract as much support as Pat Buchanan did against Bush in 1992, the model for a Level 2 primary challenge.
But of course, we can’t give them a final grade until after the primary. It will be interesting to see if one of the three is more successful given that they each represent different wings of the party: Weld is a socially liberal New England Republican; Sanford is a fiscal hawk in the wonkish ideological mold of former House Speaker Paul Ryan. And Walsh is a former tea partier who actually shares some of Trump’s controversial stances — for example, he called former President Barack Obama a Muslim and an “enemy of the state,” although he has since said he was wrong for doing so.
So someone like Weld may be best positioned to appeal to the most Trump-skeptical Republicans: those who are liberal or moderate, live in urban or suburban areas, are younger and/or identify as independents. On the other hand, Walsh’s in-your-face style may be needed to actually pry away some of the president’s existing support. Then again, maybe Sanford may hold the most appeal to business-oriented Republicans (and their deep pockets), who have traditionally made up the Republican establishment.
At the same time, if there is only a limited amount of anti-Trump sentiment in the party to go around — say, 10 or 20 percent, based on the polls — there is the risk that Republican challengers split that small share into even smaller pieces, rather than eat more into Trump’s support. For example, a HarrisX national poll from May, when Trump and Weld were the only notable Republicans in the race, gave Trump a 73-7 lead. But HarrisX’s latest national poll, the first to include Walsh, puts Trump at 76 percent, Walsh at 5 percent and Weld at 3 percent. So any additional candidates who jump into the race saying they want to “stop Trump” may make it harder to do just that.
That said, even if the president doesn’t lose renomination, it would still be a bad sign for Trump if one of his challengers gets frisky and siphons off a respectable share of the primary vote. It would put him in a category with Ford, Carter and Bush, which would bode poorly for his reelection chances. Realistically, that may turn out to be the most important takeaway from Walsh’s and other primary challengers’ campaigns.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

10 candidates
The next Democratic presidential debate — scheduled for Sept. 12 in Houston — will feature just 10 candidates, facing off all together on a single night. Polls released yesterday morning, hours before the qualifying deadline, did not help any of the “struggling” candidates who had yet to make the stage, which required polls showing 2 percent support. Had they, the debate would have been split over two nights. [FiveThirtyEight]

The 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg has arrived in New York to speak at the United Nations Climate Action Summit next month. And, lucky her, she didn’t even have to deal the living hell of LaGuardia. Thunberg arrived after a 15-day voyage on a “zero-emissions sailboat to reduce the environmental impact of her journey.” [CNN]
$1 billion sale
The owner of the Kansas City Royals, David Glass, is reportedly in talks with a local businessman, John Sherman, to sell the team for $1 billion. Glass bought the team in 2000 for $96 million which — checks calculator — now seems like a pretty good investment. [ESPN]
3.8 million years ago
Until recently, our knowledge of the faces of our ancestor genus Australopithecus — a group made famous by Lucy — was limited to remains of jaws and teeth. But a newly reported, 3.8-million-year-old fossil found in Ethiopia includes more of the skull and face and “shows the beginning of the massive and robust faces found in Australopithecus, built to withstand strains from chewing tough food,” according to scientists.

No. 24
College football is upon us and, despite finishing the past two seasons at 4-8, the Nebraska Cornhuskers were ranked No. 24 in the AP preseason poll. Only nine other teams had been ranked following two losing seasons, and none of them had records as bad as Nebraska. There may be hope for the Huskers: Of those nine teams, six finished the season top 20, and all of them finished with winning records. [FiveThirtyEight]
Category 1
The storm named Dorian hit the U.S. Virgin Islands yesterday as a Category 1 hurricane, and could strengthen to a Category 3 as it travels toward the U.S. mainland. It is heading “in the general direction of Florida” and could reach the mainland as soon as this weekend. Dorian could land anywhere from South Florida to South Carolina, on either Sunday or Monday, according to a National Hurricane Center meteorologist. [Associated Press]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgia-will-now-have-two-senate-elections-in-2020/,2019-08-29,,,features,"Aug. 29, 2019",Georgia Will Now Have Two Senate Elections In 2020,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Senate Elections,"With the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate currently standing at 53-47, Democrats need to net four seats in the 2020 election to take control — or three, if they also win the presidency and therefore the vice presidency, the tie-breaking vote in the chamber. Democrats’ opportunities to do so expanded on Wednesday, when Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson announced that he would resign at the end of the year. Isakson, a Republican who has served in the Senate since 2005, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2015 and cited his “mounting health challenges” as the reason for his decision.
What happens next is that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will appoint a new senator to serve until the next regularly scheduled general election (in this case, November 2020), at which point a special election will be held to decide who serves the rest of Isakson’s term. Because Isakson was not scheduled to be up for reelection until 2022, the upshot for Democrats is that one extra Republican-held Senate seat will be on the ballot next year1 — and it comes in a state that could be competitive.
With FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean2 of R+12, Georgia is still a red state. But the steady growth of the state’s nonwhite population and the defection of voters in well-educated suburbs (such as those around Atlanta) to Democrats in the Trump era have caused it to drift left. In the 2008 presidential election, Georgia was 12.5 points redder than the nation as a whole; in 2012, it was 11.8 points redder; in 2016, it was 7.3 points redder. It is reasonable to expect, then, that Georgia could be even closer to the tipping point in 2020. In other words, a good national cycle for Democrats — or a good Democratic candidate — could be enough to flip the seat blue (or at least come close).
Furthermore, Georgia’s other U.S. senator, Republican David Perdue, was already up for reelection next year. That’s a big deal because chances are that the same party will win both Senate seats. Why? Because when both of a state’s Senate seats are on the ballot at the same time, they almost always go the same way. The last time there was a split decision in one of these “double-barrel” Senate elections was 1966. So Democrats might try harder in Georgia in 2020 than they were already going to, as they could get two Senate seats for the price of one. That said, with Senate results increasingly determined by presidential partisanship, both seats may simply go the way of the presidential race — and right now, handicappers expect President Trump to carry Georgia in 2020.
So who might run? For Republicans, Kemp may try to appoint someone who would then turn around and run in the special election, in the hopes that it would confer an incumbency advantage. But incumbency doesn’t benefit appointed incumbents as much as those who are elected. (It might help clear the GOP primary field, though, which could be especially important in this election — more on that in a moment.) Kemp hasn’t said yet who he’ll appoint, but the Atlanta Journal-Constitution offers Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, Attorney General Chris Carr and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue as potential candidates or appointees.
For Democrats, the question is whether they can field a formidable opponent. The obvious candidate — former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams — has already removed herself from consideration. Abrams, who came within 1.4 percentage points of defeating Kemp in the 2018 governor’s race, quickly issued a statement saying she would not run. But in the leadup to the 2018 election, Abrams herself was untested in a statewide campaign, so it’s not impossible that some currently unknown Democrat could emerge.
There’s also one final twist to be aware of — the reason it would behoove each party to rally around a single candidate: Instead of a normal primary followed by a general election, all candidates, regardless of party, will run in a single “jungle primary” on Nov. 3, 2020. So if no candidate receives a majority, the top two finishers will advance to a runoff.3 This makes the race extra unpredictable, as any runoff would occur without the increased turnout of the presidential election influencing the results of the race.
Finally, it feels like we say this about some runoff somewhere every election cycle and it never comes true, but it is possible that control of the U.S. Senate could hinge on the result of Georgia’s special-election runoff. That means we might not know which party is in charge until the cycle is essentially over: The runoff would take place on Jan. 5, 2021 (!), which is two days after the new Senate is scheduled to be sworn in.
In order to net three or four Senate seats, Democrats will need to be competitive in a broad array of races. And while that field is relatively small thanks to the Senate’s small-state and Republican bias, which reserves the same number of seats for a sparsely populated state as for a crowded one, the placement of this seat on the 2020 map gives Democrats one more path to the majority than they had at the beginning of the week. Although they remain underdogs in the Peach State, that is still good news for the party.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

For a long time, my favorite Riddler has been the Battle for Riddler Nation, first suggested a couple of years ago by Joel Baker. It brings together all of what makes this column what it is: a fantastical story, mathematics, large-scale interaction, the power of computer simulation, game theory and fierce (yet good-natured) competition. So let us battle once more. Here are the rules:
In a distant, war-torn land, there are 10 castles. There are two warlords: you and your archenemy. Each castle has its own strategic value for a would-be conqueror. Specifically, the castles are worth 1, 2, 3, …, 9, and 10 victory points. You and your enemy each have 100 soldiers to distribute, any way you like, to fight at any of the 10 castles. Whoever sends more soldiers to a given castle conquers that castle and wins its victory points. If you each send the same number of troops, you split the points. You don’t know what distribution of forces your enemy has chosen until the battles begin. Whoever wins the most points wins the war.
Submit a plan distributing your 100 soldiers among the 10 castles. Once we receive all your battle plans, we’ll adjudicate all the possible one-on-one matchups. Whoever wins the most wars wins the battle royale and is crowned king or queen of Riddler Nation!
For your strategizing benefit, you may consult Riddler Nation’s chosen attack distributions from the first, second and third sanctionings of this battle royale, which had the same rules. A summary of them is in the table below. Adapt and conquer!

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏 Stephen Wilson 👏 of Nashville, Tennessee, winner of last week’s Riddler Express!
Last week found you employed as an expert counterfeiter, specializing in forging $100 bills. You knew from experience that the bank could only spot your fakes 25 percent of the time, and that trying to deposit only counterfeit bills would be a ticket to jail. However, if you combined fake and real notes, there was a chance the bank will accept your money. You had $2,500 in real hundreds and an unlimited supply of counterfeits. The bank scrutinized cash deposits carefully: They randomly selected 5 percent of the notes they received, rounded up to the nearest whole number, for close examination. If they identified any note in a deposit as fake, they would confiscate the entire sum, leaving you only enough time to flee. How many fake notes should you have added to the $2,500 in order to maximize the expected value of your bank account? How much free money were you likely to make?
You should add 55 fake notes to your 25 real notes for a total deposit of $8,000. Your expected gain is $1,256.
The full counterfeit solution (counterfeit bills, that is … the solution itself is very real) comes to us from this puzzle’s submitter, Jason Ash:
Your expected gain is the weighted average of expected profit from successful deposits and expected losses from bank seizures. With 55 fake notes, there is a 47 percent chance — a combination of the chances of the bank selecting our fake notes for examination and of the examination revealing any fake notes — we avoid detection and collect a profit of $5,500, the value of the fake notes we were able to sneak into circulation. (Remember we started with $2,500, so only the fake notes count as profit.) There is a 53 percent chance we are caught by the bank and lose the $2,500 in real dollars we used as decoys. Therefore, our expected profit is (0.47)(5,500) – (0.53)(2,500) = 1,256.
How can we be sure no other strategy produces a higher profit? For example, suppose we combine 30 fake notes with 25 real notes instead. The bank will select three notes for its audit — that is, 5 percent of 55, rounded up to the nearest whole number. Depending on our luck, the bank could choose all three fake notes, all three real notes, or some combination in between.
Let’s assume the bank randomly chooses two fake notes and one real note for its audit. This occurs with roughly 41.5 percent probability, given by the formula (3 choose 2)(30/55)(29/54)(25/53). Each fake note is detected 25 percent of the time, which means at least one fake note from the pool of two is detected \(1-0.75^2\) = 43.75 percent of the time. We use similar logic to solve for the likelihood and detection rate of the audits with three fake, one fake and zero fake notes. The overall detection rate is equal to the weighted average across each potential audit.
For the 30 fake, 25 real strategy, the probability of success is 64.3 percent — again, we need to either avoid their selecting our fake notes for examination or, if they do select them, avoiding identification of them as such — and the probability of detection is 35.7 percent. Therefore, the expected profit is (0.643)(3,000) – (0.357)(2,500) = 1,038. That’s a decent payday, but we can do better. The chart below shows the profit for strategies with up to 200 fake notes, and it illustrates that the maximum is achieved when we use 55 of them.
We can see two patterns above. First, as we move to the right, we enter the “greedy danger zone,” in which the bank becomes more likely to discover our fraud and seize the starting capital, resulting in larger and larger expected losses. Second, we see “sawtooth” behavior caused by the bank’s practice of auditing 5 percent of deposited notes. The effect is significant: 55 is the ideal answer because if we deposit 80 total notes, the bank will audit four. If we use 56 fake notes for a total of 81, then the bank audits five notes instead, which cuts the expected gain in half!
A life of crime only pays if you’re good with numbers. But with great power comes great responsibility, Riddler Nation.
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏 Jake Wiley 👏 of Wilmington, Delaware, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic!
Last week also found you employed in your second job as the resident mathematician of the Puzzling Pizza pizzeria. Your boss had purchased the equipment necessary to design the machine below.

Your job was to calculate the exact path and flow rate the sauce-dispensing arm should use to fill a 12-inch circular pizza with sauce as fully and evenly as possible. The dough sat on a platform rotating at a constant speed, and the arm traveled in a straight line across the pizza, distributing sauce in a circular shape with a 0.5-inch diameter. Once the arm started pouring sauce, it couldn’t stop until the pizza is covered, and the sauce can only be poured onto the dough. At the end, the pizza was meant to have an even layer of sauce on as much of its surface as possible. What path and flow rate should the sauce-dispensing arm take to give you the best pizza?
The full solution comes to us from this puzzle’s submitter, Tyler Barron:
Let’s start with the path the arm would take. The best method is to start at the middle and move outwards at a constant velocity until you reached the end. (It’s also possible to travel this route from the outside in.) This shape it would create is known as an​ ​Archimedean spiral​. Saucing a pizza like so would give you a path that looks like this — the spiral stops where it does simply because we’ve run out of room for more sauce:
This curve should move outward at a rate of 0.5 inches per rotation for 23.5 rotations, until the arm is 11.75 inches out. To introduce some formal notation to our pizzeria, this can be written as \(r(\theta)=\frac{0.5}{2\pi}(\theta)\).
Finding the flow rate is more difficult. To start, let’s get a baseline of what our sauce would look like if we distributed it at a constant rate through the entire path. If we did this, we would get a pizza that looks like this:
As you can see, the sauce is thinner on the edges and thicker in the center. Why? Imagine the final rotation where the arm travels around almost the entire circumference, compared to one earlier where it travels through the middle of the pizza. The distance traveled per rotation decreased but the amount of sauce per rotation stayed the same, so we’re left with a higher density of pizza sauce on the inner ring.
Therefore, we need to adjust the flow of sauce to the speed of the pizza traveling under the arm. This can be found by taking the derivative of the arc length equation. That beast — specifically, the​ ​Archimedean spiral arc length equation​ — is written mathematically as \(s(\theta)=\frac{b}{2}(\theta \sqrt{1+\theta^2}+\sinh^{-1}(\theta))\). Its derivative gives us the rate that the length changes as we rotate, and that is \(\frac{ds}{d\theta}=b\sqrt{1+\theta^2}\).
Finally (we promise) this can be converted to the relative flow rate by dividing the derivative by the rate of change at the edges, giving you the saucer’s arm speed compared to its maximum speed. That formula is: \(F(\theta)=\frac{b\sqrt{1+\theta^2}}{b\sqrt{1+(47\pi)^2}}=\frac{\sqrt{1+\theta^2}}{147.66}\).
That gives us a (nearly linear) increasing sauce-flow rate that looks like so. As the dough moves through its rotations, we increase the flow from almost nothing at the center to full strength at the edge:
Using this flow rate will give you an even spread of sauce on the pizza, which means we should program the pizza maker to use a path of \(r(\theta)=\frac{0.5}{2\pi}(\theta)\) and a relative flow rate of \(F(\theta)=\frac{\sqrt{1+\theta^2}}{147.66}\). The final result is the rather delicious-looking image below.
Now that’s a pizza Archimedes would be proud of.

A showdown in Queens this year between these two famous rivals — which could only happen in the final — would be mandatory viewing for tennis fans. But despite the history between these two stars, their rivalry is not the greatest in men’s tennis history. No, that claim belongs to Nadal and Novak Djokovic.
You might be laughing out loud at that. But the numbers speak for themselves. Since their first meeting in 2006, Djokovic and Nadal have gone mano a mano in 54 matches, according to the ATP Tour — the most between any two players in the Open era, which began in 1968. What’s more, their career series is remarkably close: Djokovic has won 28, while Nadal has won 26.
Every other significant rivalry in modern history1 is more lopsided, in addition to having fewer total matches. John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors played 34 times, with McEnroe holding a bigger edge than Djokovic does over Nadal. Likewise, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi played 34 times, and Sampras won 20 to Agassi’s 14.

When they first met at the French Open in 2006, Nadal and Djokovic had one major title between the two of them. Now, Nadal has 18 while Djokovic has 16 — and at ages 33 and 32, respectively, they could both reach or surpass Federer’s current major record of 20.
Federer and Nadal have played epic matches, including most famously when Nadal beat Federer in five sets at the 2008 Wimbledon final, finishing in the waning light at 9:15 p.m. local time. But Federer and Nadal have played 14 matches in majors versus 15 for Nadal and Djokovic. Federer vs. Djokovic is a remarkable rivalry, too, but they also have not played as many times overall (48). And unlike Djokovic and Federer or Federer and Nadal, Djokovic and Nadal have met in the final of all four Grand Slams. Djokovic is also one of only two men to beat Nadal at the French Open; he did so in the quarterfinals in 2015.
And Djokovic and Nadal’s rivalry is more competitive in the Slams, as well, with Nadal winning nine major matches to Djokovic’s six. By comparison, Nadal leads 10 to four against Federer at majors.
Even if you rate Nadal’s win over Federer in the famous 2008 Wimbledon match as the greatest men’s match of this era, Djokovic and Nadal have had some epic showdowns, too. The final of the 2012 Australian Open is right there among the greats. The sets were long with a lot of running, improbable winners and extra T-shirts. In the end, Djokovic prevailed in a five-hour, 53-minute slog. They both had difficulty standing during the trophy ceremony.
Other matches have been similarly captivating. In the semifinals of the French Open in 2013, Nadal beat Djokovic 9-7 in the fifth set — capping a clay-court marathon that lasted four hours and 37 minutes. At Wimbledon last year, also a semifinal, the match was played under the roof, even when they had to finish the match the next day. Nadal lost in the fifth set, 10-8.
Djokovic and Nadal may meet again soon; if it’s in this U.S. Open, a potential 55th match between the two — the event’s top seeds — would come in the final on Sept. 8. And if not, perhaps because of the shoulder injury Djokovic is nursing, there will likely be many more big matches between them in the future. They’re still in their primes, and they’re just too good to stay away from each other.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Planned Parenthood faced a difficult choice. To comply with a new Trump administration rule for the Title X grant program, which bars funding recipients from providing or referring abortions, the organization would have to drastically reform the way it operated. It could either build separate facilities for its abortion procedures — which would be a big financial burden — or give up performing abortions altogether, in the hope of continuing to receive money for low-income women’s reproductive health services. In both situations, Planned Parenthood would also be prohibited from referring patients to an abortion provider. In the end, the organization chose a third path: It walked away from up to $60 million annually in federal funds.
This decision has already resulted in higher fees for women in some states. And it carries some political risks for Planned Parenthood as well, according to Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who studies the politics of reproductive health. “There’s a narrative that Planned Parenthood has been prioritizing abortion rights advocacy over other forms of care for women, and there’s a sense in which this choice could reinforce that,” she said.
Whether this will be a win for the Trump administration and Republicans isn’t entirely clear, either. For one thing, the rule is still being challenged in court. But restricting funding for organizations that provide both abortions and reproductive health services also may not be that popular — even among a significant share of Republicans. One recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that a majority of Americans, including 48 percent of Republicans, don’t have a problem with abortion providers receiving federal funding for contraception and other services. And some experts told me that the Trump administration is wading into risky territory, since contraception just isn’t as controversial as abortion.
On the other hand, Republicans really don’t like Planned Parenthood. According to a 2018 Gallup poll, 63 percent of Republicans have an unfavorable view of the organization — which puts them out of step with independents and Democrats, who view Planned Parenthood much more favorably. So even though some Republicans may be leery about yanking family planning funding from abortion providers in a general sense, they are much more unified on the specific question of defunding Planned Parenthood: According to that Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 57 percent of Republicans said state payments to Planned Parenthood should stop. “A lot of conservatives won’t see this as the Trump administration cutting off birth control access,” said Daniel Williams, a history professor at the University of West Georgia who studies the pro-life movement. “It’s about removing federal funding for a group that’s been vilified on the right for many, many years.”
In general, Ziegler said, taking actions that could restrict birth control access — which the Trump administration has also sought to do by trying to grant religious employers broader exemptions to the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate — is riskier than going after abortion. “Contraception is a trickier issue for the right to navigate because a lot of Americans in the middle are in favor of contraception and they like programs like Title X,” Ziegler said.
Most Republicans in the Kaiser Family Foundation poll were opposed to giving funding to organizations that don’t offer contraception or only provide contraception on natural family planning methods, which is a form of birth control that doesn’t involve drugs or devices, but is typically less effective than other common contraceptive methods. That’s important because under the new rule, organizations that receive Title X dollars are also no longer required to provide pregnancy options counseling that includes information about abortion, which means that faith-based or other anti-abortion groups that don’t provide a full range of contraceptive options are newly eligible for federal funding. Although changes in Title X funding could affect a significant number of women, most won’t be directly affected. “The vast majority of people who use Title X are low-income, minority women,” said Rebecca Kreitzer, a public policy professor at the University of North Carolina. “That’s not the experience most people have, and it’s also a group that isn’t very mobilized politically.”
So some Republicans might be uncomfortable with the Trump administration’s move, particularly if it starts having an impact on reproductive health services more broadly. A Quinnipiac poll conducted in 2017 found, for example, that Republicans’ support for defunding Planned Parenthood fell when respondents were told the money wouldn’t be used for abortion. That complexity may not be enough to shift the political dynamics of this specific battle — but it’s an important reminder that birth control is a more complicated political issue for Republicans than abortion.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): On Monday, a new national Monmouth poll found that Joe Biden’s status as the 2020 Democratic front-runner may be in jeopardy. The former vice president is no longer the sole candidate at the top of the pack: Rather, the pollster found him, at 19 percent support, in a three-way tie for first with Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both at 20 percent.
Of course, this is just one poll and Biden still has the highest polling average at 28 percent, according to Real Clear Politics. But it’s also possible that the dynamics of this race, which up until this point have been pretty stable, are finally shifting, with Biden on the decline and Warren and Sanders on the upswing.
In fact, could Warren be the new front-runner? She and Sanders are neck and neck in their RCP polling averages — and according to The Economist’s polling average, she’s actually now in second. What’s more, since Warren entered the race in January, she has steadily moved from polling in the single digits and fifth or sixth place nationally to the double digits and second and third place. So what evidence do we have to support the idea that Warren in the lead (or close to it)? Or if you don’t think Warren is the front-runner, who do you think is?
nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): I think Biden is still pretty clearly the front-runner. The vast majority of polls still give him a healthy lead.
natesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): She’s not in the lead nationally. You could maaaaaayayayayayayaybe convince me that she’s the most likely to win the nomination, though.
nrakich: That said, if your question is, “Is Elizabeth Warren one of the two most likely Democratic nominees?” I would answer yes for sure.
natesilver: C’mon, that’s a cop-out, Nathaniel!
sarahf: srsly
ameliatd (Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, senior writer): Could we say that she is a front-runner? I think that’s becoming more and more plausible, and also maybe less of a cop-out.
Warren’s slow but steady growth in support is worth taking very seriously. Maybe she’s not the front-runner but she’s an increasingly serious threat to Biden.
And given the fact that we’ve heard over and over again that voters are concerned about nominating a woman, Warren’s increasing support is that much more impressive.
natesilver: I’d say she’s one of the 20 most likely winners.
nrakich: Fine, I’ll rephrase — I think Warren is the second-most likely nominee.
I still think Biden is the most likely.
Flag, planted.
natesilver: I feel like someone has to play devil’s advocate here.
Maybe I’ll do that? Even though I’m not totally sure I buy it?
sarahf: So, I realize Monmouth is just one poll. And of course, Monmouth wasn’t even the only poll to drop Monday. Morning Consult also released its weekly tracking poll, which found Biden in the lead with 33 percent, Sanders in second with 20 percent and Warren in third at 15 percent. So Nathaniel is right that Biden is still the front-runner — I’m not really disputing that.
What I am curious to know is whether the tides are changing and there is evidence that Warren could usurp the lead.
natesilver: Oh, my devil’s advocate case wouldn’t even reference the Monmouth poll at all. Because I’m a good devil’s advocate, not a facetious one.
sarahf: Ha, so what’s the devil’s advocate argument here?
natesilver: The devil’s advocate case is just that she’s been moving up steadily, she’s the most likely candidate to win Iowa, she has the best favorables in the field, she might have the best campaign organization and Biden — although probably a little UNDER-rated on balance — has a lot of vulnerabilities.
sarahf: Huh, I guess I don’t think of that as a devil’s advocate argument. Sounds like an explanation for why Warren is now in second or third, depending on what polling average you look at, and a reason why she might continue to climb upward in the polls.
nrakich: Here’s how I think the argument goes for why Warren isn’t in first place today but might wind up on top: We don’t hold a national primary day. If we did, Biden would be on much safer ground with his polling lead. But as it stands, Warren has a clear path to winning the first three primary states:
As Nate alluded to, Warren is a good fit for Iowa. She has led some polls there, and she’s not that far behind Biden in others. Relatedly, Biden is relatively weak in Iowa, as Nate wrote recently — he has just the fifth-best favorable rating of any candidate there. (And guess who’s in first?)

Plus, as a candidate from next-door Massachusetts, Warren already has home-field advantage in New Hampshire. And if she does win Iowa, that will give her a boost heading into the Granite State.
If she wins Iowa and New Hampshire, she will definitely have a boost going into the next state, Nevada. Nevada is also a heavily unionized state, which seems like a good fit for her. Plus, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is reportedly partial to Warren, and he might be willing to deploy his powerful turnout machine on her behalf. (Although Warren already has a pretty good campaign apparatus in Nevada on her own!)
So despite Biden’s lead in national polls, the actual state-by-state results might lead to a Warren nomination more often.
natesilver: Meh, I think the momentum shit is overrated.
The momentum shit from winning primaries, that is.
Like, it’s not nothing. It’s something! But, if you look at the Obama-Clinton contest in 2008, or Clinton-Sanders in 2016, the vast majority of who does better in which state is determined by demographics, not timing.
nrakich: Right, but I don’t think my argument relies on Warren winning, say, Iowa in order to keep her afloat in subsequent states. Warren has some natural advantages in New Hampshire and Nevada, too. Any momentum from winning previous states just makes her case for winning them even stronger.
natesilver: But then Biden wins South Carolina by six million points and who has the momentum on Super Tuesday?
ameliatd: On the demographics issue, one big question I have about Warren is how she will continue to broaden her support. She’s significantly more popular among white voters than black or Hispanic voters, and that could pose a serious problem for her.
nrakich: Combining Nate’s and Amelia’s points, certainly her weakness with black voters — who constitute almost a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate — is a problem for Warren.
natesilver: WhY aRe YoU gUyS eRaSiNg BeRnIe?
sarahf: Ha, I was just going to get to that.
Ostensibly, Warren and Sanders are roughly in the same place in the polls — Sanders has a poll average of 17.7 percent and Warren 16.0 percent, according to RCP. So are there actually two new front-runners?
ameliatd: How many front-runners is too many front-runners??
natesilver: Not in my view, no. I think Warren and Biden are No. 1 and 2 for likelihood of winning the nomination in some order, and I think Sanders is No. 3.
Why? First of all, Warren’s polls are a bit better than Sanders. She has roughly equal support nationally despite being less well known, and she has slightly better net favorables. She’s doing better in Iowa. And she has more upward momentum, although that can be overrated.
Second, if you put any weight on the sort of “party decides” view of the race, the party establishment seems to view her as being quite a bit more acceptable than Bernie, although she doesn’t have a ton of endorsements yet.
nrakich: Yeah, Sanders does not appear to be interested in expanding his coalition; he’s pretty much been stuck polling in the same 15-to-18 percent range since Biden entered the race, whereas Warren has been steadily winning people over. According to The Economist, only 38 percent of Democrats are considering voting for Sanders, whereas 49 percent are considering voting for Warren … which is even (slightly) more than the 48 percent who are considering voting for Biden!
ameliatd: Warren does seem to be doing quite a bit of work to position herself as a progressive candidate who’s also not a threat to the Democratic establishment — which is not Bernie’s typical M.O.
natesilver: That Economist poll has generally had good numbers for Warren, though. So I’d be a little careful there.
But polls do show that more informed voters are generally more into Warren than Sanders. So that’s another bad sign for Bernie (and Biden). As voters tune in, they seem to gravitate toward Warren more.
sarahf: I also thought the second quarter’s fundraising numbers were particularly telling when it came to support for Warren and Sanders. Warren tripled her numbers from the first quarter and raised the third-most from individual contributors, after Pete Buttiegieg and Biden (and before Sanders). And even though a greater percentage of Sanders’s donations currently come from small donors (or those giving $200 or less) than Warren, a Los Angeles Times analysis found that more than 80 percent of the donors who funded Sanders’s 2016 bid have not given to him this cycle, so this is, to me, evidence of a larger enthusiasm problem with Sanders.
And that’s important, because rightly or wrongly, Warren and Sanders are going to have to work to distinguish themselves from each other.
nrakich: I think they’re already distinguishing themselves, Sarah. Even though they’re not attacking each other, Warren has made clear efforts, as Amelia said, to show that she can play nice with the establishment. Sanders has continued to rail against economic and political institutions.
sarahf: And I guess at this point, Warren and Sanders’s bases are pretty different from each other, right?
natesilver: Well, part of the reason their bases are different now is because Warren has stolen most of the college-educated left from Bernie.
So what’s over in Sanders’s coalition is a bit eclectic — some real dyed-in-the-wool anti-establishment types, but also some non-college educated voters who aren’t necessarily that far to the left but like his populism or just like his message and personality.
nrakich: There is a big gender gap between Warren and Sanders, though. According to a Quinnipiac poll from early August, Sanders is second among men with 19 percent support, and Warren is third with 16 percent. But among women, Warren is second with 24 percent, and Sanders is third with 10 percent. (Biden is in first with both groups.)
sarahf: Are there more opportunities for Warren to continue to take voters away from Sanders? Or is she better off targeting voters from, say, Biden or Harris?
ameliatd: Isn’t Warren already siphoning some support from Harris? There seemed to be overlap between their supporters, at least earlier in the summer.
nrakich: Right. And my guess, Amelia, is that a lot of the voters who jumped on the Harris train after the first debate have since decamped to Warren.
And to Nate’s point, I suspect a lot of those 2016 Sanders voters without college degrees are now with Biden. So Sanders is kind of getting pinched from all sides.
natesilver: Yeah, I definitely think there’s evidence of a Harris-Warren overlap.
ameliatd: I also wonder how much some combination of sexism and electability concerns are holding Warren back, and how that will play out as the primary moves forward. There was some research earlier in the summer suggesting that both Warren and Harris were taking a hit among Democratic voters with more sexist views. And then there are the meta-sexism concerns from people who think a woman will have a harder time getting elected. As she continues to build support, maybe she’s chipping away at the latter? It’s obviously a hard thing to measure.
nrakich: Yeah, Amelia, maybe some voters have realized that Biden isn’t as electable as they thought, after seeing him struggle in the debates.
ameliatd: That would be my guess, Nathaniel. Although it’s interesting that Biden and Warren have yet to be on a debate stage together. If that happens next month (fingers crossed for one night!) maybe that shifts the dynamic between the two?
natesilver: It almost feels like there’s some weird shit like this going on, in terms of how voters are flowing between the candidates.
sarahf: Omg. What is that?
nrakich: Hahaha. I think that’s pretty good! My most recent piece on lanes in the Democratic primary indeed found that there is very little overlap between Sanders and Harris supporters, and not much between Warren and Biden supporters either.
ameliatd: But in terms of Warren being able to pull more supporters from Harris, a strong debate performance against Biden couldn’t hurt.
natesilver: IDK, if we’re forced to have two debates, the DNC could draw the rules up such that candidates who haven’t faced one another yet are more likely to be paired.
sarahf: I’m not so sure Warren can’t eat more into Biden’s support, though. Another thing that I thought was interesting in that Monmouth poll is that they found that among moderates who haven’t been paying as much attention, there is evidence they are swinging toward Sanders or Warren instead of toward a lesser-known candidate who might be more of an ideological fit.
And maybe this is just further proof that lanes don’t really exist, but it is interesting to me that among the more moderate candidates, there doesn’t seem to be an ordained alternative to Biden.
natesilver: Maybe it’s Buttigieg? But he’s still sort of a niche brand.
ameliatd: Is Harris’s name-recognition really that much lower than Warren or Sanders’s, though? It’s interesting, because moderates don’t seem to be flocking to her, and she’s someone who you think they’d be interested in.
natesilver: Yeah, I don’t know why there are so many WHY IS BIDEN STRUGGLING?!?!? takes when Harris is clearly the one who’s had a rough month or so in the polls.
nrakich: Amelia, 79 percent of Democrats can form an opinion of Harris, according to an average of August polls. That’s comparable to the 83 percent who can form an opinion of Warren. Biden and Sanders are noticeably higher — they have almost universal name recognition within the party.
sarahf: It’s true that Harris has had a much rougher month in the polls than Biden, but something else that stuck out to me in Nathaniel’s story was that Biden had the biggest drop of any candidate in his net favorability rating (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) — he dropped 8 points from May to August, and 17 points from the beginning of the year. So I think, even if Harris might be down more at this particular point in time, some of the conventional wisdom might be that she has more of an opportunity to gain back what she’s lost in the polls than Biden?
ameliatd: I wonder if Harris’s flaw is that she’s not so easily categorized. People know who she is, but she’s kind of been staking out a middle ground between the moderates and the liberals. Warren, on the other hand, has a clear brand, which could be helping her right now. Maybe there’s room for Harris to recover, though?
nrakich: Frankly, I think primaries are periods of ebbs and flows. Right now, Harris and Sanders are down, while Biden and Warren are up (Biden more in the absolute sense, Warren more in the relative sense). But Harris and Sanders have shown the ability to appeal to these now-Warren-and-Biden-supporters before. So if they campaign smartly, they could certainly gain them back.
natesilver: Yeah, Amelia, that was basically the critique I had of Harris: She’s trying to split the difference and it … isn’t working, right now at least. But a campaign like Harris’s, which doesn’t have as clearly defined of a base, is inherently liable to be more volatile than someone with more of a base of their own.
ameliatd: But Warren has been steadily gaining support for months. And that seems hard to dismiss, especially with all of this movement. Unless she eventually hits some kind of ceiling, of course.
nrakich: I think it’s definitely a good sign for Warren that her increase has been slow and steady, instead of a Buttigiegian “bump.”
sarahf: OK, pulse check. No one at the beginning of this chat was willing to say Warren is the front-runner, and maybe that’s still true. But let’s wrap by talking about where you see her in the race currently, and what you’re going to be watching for going forward.
natesilver: I’m gonna be watching for whether she can gain more traction with non-college educated voters, and with black voters. And I’m gonna be watching if she gets more endorsements. We haven’t really taken the time in this chat to make the case against Warren, but those three things above would be a big part of it.
ameliatd: I will be really curious to see what happens when Warren ends up on a debate stage with Biden, and whether that helps defuse any more electability concerns.
nrakich: I see Warren as a clear No. 2. And there are a couple of good indicators for her that, if she eventually overtakes Biden, we will point to as early signs of that. But I think I will mostly look to see if coverage of Biden continues to be skeptical and if his favorability ratings continue to decline.
natesilver: Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I sort of disagree with Rakich. I think Warren’s chances are more about Warren than Biden.
Biden’s at, IDK, 29 percent right now. And maybe 23 or 24 percent in Iowa or something. It shouldn’t be that hard for Warren to surpass him even if he doesn’t decline at all.
nrakich: Nate makes a good point, and I could easily see the race boiling down to Warren vs. Biden by Super Tuesday. But for Warren to become a favorite over Biden, as opposed to a co-front-runner? I think Biden has to help out with that.
ameliatd: Warren is gaining on Biden — and seems to be surpassing Sanders — but it’s probably still important to watch how she performs relative to Harris, too.
Despite having some overlap in supporters, they also haven’t gone after each other — does that start to change, if Harris sees Warren as a threat?
sarahf: Yeah, we didn’t really talk about the case against Warren — but I think Nate’s landed on one of her biggest vulnerabilities: Can she win over more voters who aren’t white? Currently, as you’ve all mentioned, the crosstabs aren’t really there, but if she can build support, I think she emerges as a true front-runner. Otherwise, I think someone like Biden (or Harris) continues to have broader appeal.
nrakich: Right, Sarah. There’s also the possibility her favorability ratings decline, too. There is ample opposition research against her, like her claims of Native American ancestry and her past as a Republican, that hasn’t come up a lot in recent months but could still hurt her.
Now that I think about it, one of the benefits to Warren’s steady rise, as opposed to a sudden surge, is that she didn’t immediately get thrust into the “discovery, scrutiny, decline” cycle. Her rise has been so gradual, it might have snuck up on people. So I guess another thing I’ll be looking for is if the media, voters and her opponents start assessing her more critically.
natesilver: We should also maybe be a little bit skeptical of candidates whose support is concentrated among college-educated white people, which happens to be the demographic that the media both caters to and belongs to.
Bernie’s support is actually notably more diverse than Warren’s, and Biden’s certainly is.
ameliatd: But I do think Warren has room to grow, especially among women, if voters are actually starting to be less concerned about electability. Granted, right now, she’s doing much better among white women than women of color right now — but that could change.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

The news that Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck was retiring Saturday night set Twitter on tilt and was met with skepticism from grizzled beat reporters, boos from the Lucas Oil Stadium crowd and even disbelief from new starting quarterback Jacoby Brissett:


Jacoby Brissett: On God I'm the starter? pic.twitter.com/5DxbUPHhiF
— HGA (@FlowsAndolini) August 25, 2019

The only person who appeared unmoved by the announcement was — unsurprisingly — Bill Belichick.
When the rest of the football world recovered, the consensus outlook for the Colts under Brissett wasn’t particularly good. On Sunday, Las Vegas dropped the line on the Colts win total from 9.5 to 6.5 wins. Our FiveThirtyEight Elo system dropped the Colts from a 9.2 win team to 7.5 wins. And as seen on Sunday Night Football, the model developed by Pro Football Focus put the new Colts win total at 7.1, down from nine wins.
Looking at Brissett’s performance over his career, it’s easy to see why the math and the markets are bearish on the Colts’ prospects. Indianapolis has a 4-11 record in games Brissett started, and the quarterback has averaged 6.6 yards per attempt over his career, below the league average of 7.2 for the years Brissett has been active. Brissett averaged just more than 200 yards passing per game in his only full season as a starter — a season in which he compiled a QBR of 41.5 — and his career completion percentage is just 59.1 percent. These numbers are not good.
We can try to find a silver lining. Completion percentage can sometimes be misleading. Quarterbacks who attempt deeper passes at a higher rate than their peers will see their stat line punished despite the fact that they are helping their team by attempting more valuable throws. If we account for how deep Brissett’s passing attempts have been over his career, however, we find that there aren’t many depths where he’s above league average — although the sample sizes at some depths aren’t large enough for us to conclude this with certainty.
Among active QBs, Brisset ranks in the bottom 10 percent in completion percentage over expected. His poor performance is exacerbated by the fact that Brissett also doesn’t attack downfield as often as Luck did. Brissett’s average depth of target — a measure of the distance downfield a quarterback throws — is just 7.2 yards, 1.4 less than Luck’s 8.6. The Colts will need Brissett to target star wideout T.Y. Hilton often to compete offensively, and Hilton’s average depth of target is located well downfield at 12.4 yards. This is a legitimate cause for concern. In 2017 — the only full season Hilton and Brissett have played together — Hilton saw his targets drop to just 109 after 155 in 2016.1
There’s really no sugar-coating the Colts’ 2019 prospects. Indianapolis general manager Chris Ballard has been widely praised for the work he’s done since taking over from Ryan Grigson in 2017. But losing a franchise quarterback when you’ve built a team around the idea that you’re currently in a championship window will stress the skills of even the most competent GMs. Ballard’s options are unpalatable but clear: Try to win now with the team he’s assembled and risk being trapped in a purgatory of mediocrity while the cheap talent ages out of their early contracts, or front-load the pain and tank this season in an attempt to secure a high pick in what looks to be a promising quarterback draft class.
In a league where having a franchise quarterback is damn near everything, Brissett’s value to the Colts might be highest as air cover for a front office and coaching staff trying to lose as many games as possible.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Clemson was first, Alabama second, and the rest of the top 10 was littered with recent contenders like Oklahoma, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio State and Notre Dame. But toward the bottom, there was a bit of a surprise. The Nebraska Cornhuskers were ranked No. 24 (with one voter putting them as high as No. 12) despite finishing each of the past two seasons at 4-8.
That puts Nebraska in rare company. Since preseason polls began in 1950, only 31 teams have ever been ranked after a losing season, most recently Texas two years ago. And just five had a record worse than the Huskers.
What makes Nebraska even more unusual is the sustained losing entering this season. Just nine other schools have been ranked in the preseason after consecutive losing seasons. None came off consecutive eight-loss seasons — or even had as many combined losses over the previous two years.
So, why Nebraska? Do the Huskers deserve the early recognition?
A lot of the excitement comes from Scott Frost, in his second year coaching Nebraska. In Frost’s second year at the University of Central Florida, just two years removed from a winless season, his team finished undefeated. Husker fans and the media seem to expect a similar second-year bump.
Quarterback Adrian Martinez showed promise last season as a true freshman despite battling injuries. Just 19 years old, Martinez is in the top five of Heisman betting favorites.
And in Frost’s first year, the Huskers did finish with a better team than the one that started — possibly only because the one that started was horrible. Nebraska began 0-6, the worst start in program history, before winning four of its last six and losing a one-score game to eventual Big Ten champion Ohio State — though the Huskers’ “signature win” was a touchdown-free 9-6 victory over Michigan State, which finished just 7-6 on the year.
Despite finishing 2018 sixth in a weak Big Ten West division, Nebraska is getting a lot of attention, with some even saying it could be a title contender. The question is if that will translate to an improved team this season.
Let’s look at the 31 teams who were ranked in the preseason poll after a losing season and see what we can learn from them.

You might think that teams with a new coach or quarterback would get the nod in the polls, with a new regime the sign of a turnaround to come. But, in fact, the opposite is true. Of those 31 ranked teams, 27 had the same coach as the previous season, and 23 had the same quarterback;1 61 percent kept both; not a single one had a new coach and a new quarterback. Voters may be expecting an improvement from teams keeping the same core.
Most of these teams also didn’t have a “hot” finish to the prior season. Only UCLA in 1995 came in with three straight wins. Just six teams won their last game of the season (1990 UCLA had a tie) and the 31 teams averaged barely one win over the last three games and less than two wins over the last five.
These teams do seem to get the benefit of the doubt from their pedigree, something Nebraska certainly has. More than 80 percent had won a championship at some point in team history, and more than half within the past 25 years. All but one played in a major conference.2 Nebraska seems to fit this category. Most voters probably still remember Nebraska’s three championships between 1994 and 1997, the last two when Frost was quarterback.
Unlike Nebraska, however, most of the 31 ranked teams had a more recent track record of success, even within their two previous years. And the majority had a postseason top-10 ranking within just the previous five years. Nebraska, meanwhile, hasn’t won even its division since 2012 and has lost at least four games for 15 straight years.
But history may be on Big Red’s side. Of those 30 other ranked teams, we would expect3 12 or 13 to be top 25 in the postseason. Sixteen were. And of the other nine that were ranked after two losing seasons, six finished top 20, and all finished with more wins than losses.
The high hopes in Nebraska are a lot to live up to. But a significant turnaround wouldn’t be unprecedented. Five years ago, TCU went from 4-8 to 12-1 and very nearly made the college football playoff. In 2012, Ohio State rebounded from a 6-7 season to finish 12-0 under new head coach Urban Meyer (though the Buckeyes were ineligible for the postseason). And back in 1964, coming off a 2-7 season, Notre Dame and new head coach Ara Parseghian from Northwestern went 9-1 for a share of the national championship.
A lot will have to go right for Nebraska to complete a major rise. We’ll soon find out if they’re up to the task.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-we-prevent-mass-shootings-by-preventing-suicide/,2019-08-27,,,features,"Aug. 22, 2019",Can We Prevent Mass Shootings By Preventing Suicide?,Maggie Koerth,FiveThirtyEight,Gun Violence,"Imagine a doctor who wanted to treat a broken leg with chemotherapy. Or treat cancer with a cast.
Just because cancer and broken legs are both things that happen to the body doesn’t mean they call for the same treatment. These are the kinds of issues policymakers face every day. Take gun violence. It feels like one big problem, but it’s actually a bunch of different problems that don’t necessarily have a single cause. So when somebody wants to, say, prevent mass shootings with a policy that originated as a suicide-prevention tool, it’s reasonable to have some questions about whether that makes any sense.
And that’s exactly what’s happening with “red flag laws,” the gun legislation model of the moment, which even many gun-control-averse Republicans have supported in the wake of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. Studies have shown that state-level versions of these laws have been effective at preventing suicide. But can they actually address the separate issue of mass shootings? Surprisingly, experts think they could. And that’s because — just like a fragile, cracked bone could be a symptom of certain kinds of cancers — researchers are finding evidence that suicides and mass shootings can often be different expressions of the same problem.
“Many of these mass shootings are angry suicides,” says James Densley, professor of criminal justice at Minnesota’s Metropolitan State University.
Densley is part of a team that is working on a database of more than 150 mass shootings that took place between 1966 and 2018. His data won’t be public until January, but he said about half the attackers in his sample had demonstrated signs of feeling suicidal before they hurt others. A different set of researchers who analyzed 41 school shooters for the Secret Service and Department of Education found that 78 percent had a history of thinking about or attempting suicide.
“We’ve even talked to a couple of people who tried to kill themselves but failed and then launched an attack because they were hoping police would kill them,” said Marisa Randazzo, a former chief psychologist for the Secret Service who now consults on active threat assessment with schools and other organizations.
A third set of researchers, who compiled the details of 119 lone-actor terrorists, did not specifically track whether the people in their data set had thought about or attempted suicide, but the researchers told me they also found significant overlap between homicidal violence and choices that suggested suicidal tendencies. “A fairly sizeable subset only planned this to be a one-off event” — that is, something they didn’t return from — said Paul Gill, a professor of security and crime science at University College London and the researcher in charge of that data set. “They were taking preparations to maximize the chances of death by cop or their own hand.”
All of this means that the people who commit violent mass killings overlap, at least somewhat, with people who are feeling suicidal.
Red flag laws — which are intended to take guns out of the hands of people who might be a danger to themselves or others — aren’t going to eliminate either suicide or mass shootings, experts said. At best, these are crude tools. Plenty of people who own a gun and feel suicidal do not go on to harm themselves or attack others, and not all mass shooters were known to feel suicidal before the attack, which means the net cast by these policies will scoop up a lot of people who would never have hurt anyone while also missing some people who do go on to commit acts of violence. But enough of a pattern of suicidal feelings shows up in mass shooters that the laws might be able to reduce the rates of both.
There’s no single type of red flag law. The phrase is more of an umbrella term for a range of regulations implemented in at least 17 states. Typically, they allow people to report the dangerous behavior or mental state of someone they know. From there, those reports are evaluated and, if necessary, authorities can temporarily confiscate the troubled individual’s guns and prevent them from buying more. Once the crisis has passed, the person can get their guns back.
These rules were originally about suicide prevention, Densley told me, and were built as extensions of voluntary campaigns that encourage gun owners to give their guns to a friend if they are feeling suicidal. Experts in suicide prevention have long supported campaigns like this because of the strong links between gun accessibility and suicide. Most gun deaths in this country are suicides, and guns are the leading means of suicide. Experts say that when someone is suicidal, if they decide to act on that feeling, they are likely to turn to a familiar tool they’re already comfortable using — and when that tool is a gun, it’s particularly likely to be lethal.
And at least when it comes to suicide prevention, there’s evidence that red flag laws do work. In the decade after passing a red flag law, Indiana saw a 7.5 percent reduction in firearm suicides. In Connecticut, a red flag law was associated with a 13.7 percent reduction in firearm suicides between 2007 and 2015.
Polls show that Americans broadly support this kind of intervention, with 77 percent supporting red flag laws that allow family members to seek a court order to temporarily take away a person’s guns. And that’s true even among gun owners, where support for this kind of law polled at 67 percent. But, ultimately, red flag laws are about the state taking private property, and that can get dicey. Last year, in Maryland, police serving a red flag law order ended up fatally shooting the man they ostensibly came to save from himself. Even when things don’t turn violent, there are still civil liberties to consider. There’s no way to tell how many of the people who have their guns confiscated would actually have harmed themselves or others if they were left alone.
In the last decade, though, policy makers have begun to use red flag laws to try to prevent mass shootings as well. That makes sense in some ways, given what we know about the overlaps between suicidality and mass violence. But it also requires changing the way we think about mass shooters and how to prevent them.
Law enforcement has long tried to profile the people most likely to commit these crimes — and we aren’t very good at it, experts told me. Even once you identify some details that many of the attackers have in common, such a large swath of the population shares these traits that the “profile” is fairly useless for prevention. Red flag laws circumvent that problem by focusing less on a type of person and more on a type of emotional and situational crisis — where the people involved aren’t necessarily “bad guys” but troubled individuals in need of help. Gill thinks of it as a public health approach, analogous to the way we treat physical health problems that are hard to profile.
“We know that raised cholesterol leads to heart problems. We don’t have the ability to predict who in the general population who already has raised cholesterol will go on to have a heart attack. So we put in place prevention policies to try to decrease cholesterol in the whole ‘at risk’ community,” he said.
For the researchers who study mass violence, what’s appealing about red flag laws is that these rules have the potential to shift the emphasis from a cut-and-dried checklist of dangerous traits to a more nuanced system that accounts for a person’s big-picture emotional state. And that matters, because, it turns out, family and friends of a mass shooter are often aware that something is wrong long before the violence happens. That happened one-third of the time in Densley’s database, 64 percent in Gill’s, and 81 percent in the cases Randazzo logged.
Densley cautioned that these shootings are still extremely rare events, so the research is more about finding previously overlooked patterns than proving that a single set of traits led people to become mass shooters. What’s more, none of these research teams collected data on people who didn’t commit shootings, so they can’t say with confidence whether any of these traits are more common in mass shooters than they are in the general population. (Although Gill told me that a study that does do this is in the works.)
But right now, experts said, even when friends, family and teachers know something is wrong with a potential shooter, they may not be able to actually do much about it. Sometimes people don’t know who to tell. Sometimes they choose not to tell in order to avoid sending a loved one to prison for crimes they haven’t yet committed. Sometimes the authorities can’t do anything because the nature of the threat doesn’t include illegal behavior.
“We interviewed a social worker who had an encounter with a school shooter who had been in a suicidal crisis and [had] been admitted to the hospital before his eventual shooting occurred,” Densley said. “The social worker immediately recognized something was wrong and tried very hard to get the individual into treatment, but there were a lot of questions about his exact diagnosis and availability of psychiatric care in the community. In the end, she was unable to secure him the treatment she was trying very, very hard to get. And a few weeks later he went on to perpetrate a school shooting.”

All these researchers supported red flag laws because they could create a clear plan of action for friends and family concerned about a loved one’s combination of emotional crisis and violent threats. It creates a place to take concerns, a system to evaluate those concerns and a means of mitigating them. That’s particularly true, researchers said, if national red flag laws are set up so that the system isn’t punitive. Ideally, the process would focus on helping a person get through to the other side of an emotional crisis rather than putting them in jail. It’s also important, the researchers said, to make sure the laws are focused on professional evaluations of overall behavior, not checklists.
But if those parts work together the way they should, then red flag laws really could be a useful tool for combating the segment of mass shootings that function like very public, violent suicides. “There’s an important piece when we interviewed school shooters and active threat cases,” Randazzo said. “They feel very strongly about two things: They have to carry out the violence, they have no options left, but they also don’t want to do it and hope someone will stop them.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

But it’s been a summer of education, as two debates have introduced the Democratic presidential candidates to a broader swath of the potential electorate. More Democrats than ever have an opinion of the 2020 hopefuls, so let’s check in once again on whether those opinions are positive or negative.
Since the beginning of the year, FiveThirtyEight has been tracking polls of the candidates’ favorable and unfavorable ratings. Those ratings are important because, unlike in general elections, primary voters are often considering several different candidates, even if they tell pollsters they have a first choice. (And at this point, only a small percentage of Democratic primary voters — 12 percent, according to a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from July — say they have made up their mind about whom to vote for.) Candidates who are well-liked are in a much better position to pick up support than those who are not.
Below is the share of Democrats1 who have a favorable and unfavorable view of each candidate FiveThirtyEight considers “major,” according to an average of national polls2 taken between Aug. 1 and Aug. 25 (i.e., since the second debate). From these numbers, we’ve also calculated each candidate’s net favorability rating (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) among Democrats and the share of Democrats who can form an opinion of them (favorable rating plus unfavorable rating), a rough proxy for name recognition.

For the 20 candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight

By this measure, Democrats’ favorite candidate is not polling leader and former Vice President Joe Biden: It’s Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who sports the highest net favorability rating (+54 percentage points). Indeed, according to The Economist’s 2020 primary tracker, slightly more people are considering voting for Warren than are considering Biden, even though Biden is currently the most popular first choice. He leads in most (though not all) polls.
In fairness, Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders aren’t far behind Warren, with +52 and +51 net favorability ratings, respectively. But Warren’s standing is still impressive because she is not as well-known as Biden or Sanders. While 90+ percent of Democrats have an opinion of the two men, only 83 percent offer one on Warren; in other words, a higher proportion of people who have an opinion of Warren like her. This could suggest that Warren has not yet reached her full potential and may eventually climb from third place to first in the horse-race polls.
In fourth for both net favorability and the share of Democrats with an opinion of her is Sen. Kamala Harris, who has remained in the top tier of candidates after a breakout performance in the first debate. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg takes fifth place with a +34 net favorability rating despite relatively low name recognition, resembling Warren’s feat. Although Buttigieg’s polling surge has faded, he is still beloved among those who have gotten to know him, and he has the potential to grow, as more than a third of Democrats don’t have an opinion of him. By contrast, more Democratic voters have opinions of former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and Sen. Cory Booker (which means that, yes, Cory Booker is a household name), but they each have a lower net favorability rating than Buttigieg.
The other candidates are not as well-known, and only a few are actively disliked. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has managed to get 31 percent of Democrats to view him unfavorably — no small feat, given that only 56 percent can form an opinion of him. His -6 net favorability — among members of his own party, remember! — is the biggest anomaly in the field. And Marianne Williamson is only slightly better off. Her net favorability rating is -4 among the 47 percent of Democrats who have an opinion of her. Only one other candidate is underwater: former Rep. Joe Sestak, who has a -2 net favorability rating. But he has more of an excuse: He is the least well-known candidate in the race. And it isn’t unusual for low-name-recognition candidates to have roughly equivalent favorable and unfavorable ratings, as they are essentially blank slates. Many other 2020 candidates started at this point but became better-liked as they became better-known.
Indeed, much of that growth has happened in just the past few months, coinciding with the first two debates. Since we wrote about the candidates’ favorability numbers in May, every current Democratic aspirant for whom we have data3 has become better-known — many of them significantly so. (More than half boosted the share of Democrats with an opinion of them by double digits.) But this hasn’t necessarily translated to making a better impression on the electorate; 10 of the 18 have actually seen their net favorability ratings decline since May.

This is exactly what happened to Williamson. The share of Democrats who could form an opinion of her grew by 24 points (the biggest increase in the field), but her net favorability rating declined by 7 points. Another candidate who made big moves was former Rep. John Delaney, who greatly upped his name recognition after playing a starring role in the second debate. But audiences may not have liked what they heard, as his net favorability rating has also decreased by 5 points since May. But there were candidates who made the most of their moment in the sun. Andrew Yang’s net favorability rating rose by 12 points — around twice as much as any other candidate increased theirs — as he boosted the share of Democrats who were familiar with him from 30 percent to 52 percent.
And changes in candidates’ net favorability didn’t just come about because more people got to know them: The data suggests that some people who already had an opinion of Biden and Warren changed their minds. Warren’s net favorability rating increased by 6 points even as total opinions of her crept up by only 4. Meanwhile, the share of Democrats with an opinion of Biden barely changed (in fairness, it’s hard to increase your name recognition when almost everyone has already heard of you), but his net favorability fell by 8 points — the biggest drop of any candidate.
The debates — especially the first one — were rough on Biden (and good for Warren), but Biden’s declining popularity has actually been a trend we’ve observed since February. Comparing against an average of national favorability polls conducted from Jan. 1 through Feb. 5, Biden’s net favorability rating has plummeted 17 points so far this year. During this time period, of course, Biden went from above-the-fray party elder to active candidate under scrutiny for his interactions with women, his checkered record on civil rights and his advanced age. But so far, Biden has stayed on top of the polls, although his numbers have appeared soft at times. As the months wear on, something to watch is whether more Democrats will switch from liking to disliking Biden. If they do, then all bets are off.

In 2017, UGA had a 20-7 second half lead over Alabama in the College Football Playoff Championship — at one point, ESPN’s win probability model gave the Dawgs a 92.5 percent chance of winning — before Bama backup QB Tua Tagovailoa led the Crimson Tide to an incredible comeback win. Last season, the Bulldogs were an elite team again, and yet again they had the Tide on the ropes in the second half of a hugely important game (this time the SEC Championship) before ultimately losing when a backup QB helped engineer another Alabama rally.1 UGA ultimately missed the playoff as a result, despite probably having enough talent to deserve inclusion.
If, as they say, the third time is the charm, then this is it for head coach Kirby Smart and Georgia. The team has been good enough to win a championship in each of the previous two seasons, only to be thwarted by extraordinary circumstances — and an extraordinary opponent in the form of Smart’s old boss, Nick Saban. With junior quarterback Jake Fromm coming back for what might be the last time, this could be UGA’s most talented team yet under Smart. But can they finally break through in another college football season that figures to be dominated by Clemson and Alabama?
Other teams from history have been as good as the 2017-18 Dawgs in consecutive seasons with zero titles to show for it — but it’s pretty rare. For each team in every season since 1980,2 I calculated a “Season Score” based on our Elo ratings. The Season Score takes three measures of a team’s performance — its end-of-season Elo; its average season-long Elo; and its peak Elo3 — and averages them together to create a composite rating on the same scale as regular Elo, where the FBS average is about 1,500.
A Season Score of 2,000 is very impressive; only 100 have happened since 1980, and 33 percent of those teams have won the national championship.4 (The best Season Score belongs to Alabama in 2016 — ironically, a team that didn’t win the championship — with a mark of 2,229.) But a score of 2,000 in consecutive seasons is even rarer. Last season, Clemson, Alabama, Georgia and Ohio State joined the ranks of just 43 teams since 1980 to have back-to-back Season Scores of at least 2,000. All but eight of those teams — a number that includes both Georgia and Ohio State — failed to win at least a share of a championship in either season.

The hallmark of Georgia’s recent run under Smart might be how complete his teams are. According to ESPN’s Football Power Index, UGA had the nation’s fifth-best offense and third-best defense in 2017. They then inverted that with the third-best offense and fifth-best defense last season. The Bulldogs boasted not one but two 1,200-yard rushers (Nick Chubb and Sony Michel) back in 2017, when Fromm was a freshman, but they showcased more passing last season — with Fromm ranking as the third-best QB in the nation according to ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating, trailing only Tagovailoa and Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray.
Georgia does lose five starters apiece on offense and defense from last season, including cornerback Deandre Baker, who won 2018’s Jim Thorpe Award as the country’s top defensive back, and receivers Mecole Hardman and Riley Ridley. But Fromm’s return negates one of the biggest factors in an offense’s demise: losing the starting quarterback.

According to data collected from the 2001 through 2017 seasons, a previously average offense that loses five starters including the QB would expect to be about 12 percent less efficient than before. However, if the team retains its signal-caller, it can basically expect to carry on without missing a beat — great news for an offense as strong as UGA’s last season. The same can be said for a defense that loses five starters between seasons; our research says that team can also expect no real drop-off in efficiency between seasons, generally speaking.

And this Georgia team might be better equipped to handle moderate personnel losses than just about any other program. According to 247Sports.com’s Team Talent Composite, which adds up the total value of all the players on a roster based on their high school recruiting ratings, the Bulldogs rank third nationally going into the 2019 season with a score of 961.85 points. That’s effectively no different from last season, when UGA ranked third with a composite score of 963.87. Add in another year of seasoning for Fromm, who ranks as one of the top QB prospects in next spring’s NFL draft, and the fourth-most returning experience of any team in the SEC according to Phil Steele’s calculations, and the talent in Athens should rival that of almost any other team in the nation.
However, one team that still may be running ahead of Georgia in that regard is the same rival that’s been a thorn in the Bulldogs’ side over the past few years: Alabama. The Crimson Tide have scored better than UGA in the Team Talent Composite for five consecutive seasons, and they are also ahead in ESPN’s early season projected FPI right now. It appears Georgia will need another breakthrough to join Clemson and Bama at the very top of the college football mountain, since the gap between Alabama at No. 2 and UGA at No. 3 (5.6 points) is the same as the gap between UGA and No. 10 Oregon.
And that’s to say nothing of the Bulldogs’ crushing schedule strength. With games against Texas A&M and Notre Dame on tap, in addition to a trip to Auburn and what looks like a tougher-than-usual matchup with Florida, all before even potentially reaching the SEC title game for a third-straight season, it’s no surprise that FPI has Georgia’s schedule rated as the fourth-most difficult in the country this year. That’s even tougher than Alabama’s slate (which ranks 22nd), and it’s a big reason why FPI gives Georgia only a 2.7 percent chance of navigating through its regular-season schedule without a loss, while Bama has 15.3 percent chance of doing the same.
But Georgia has also shown these past few seasons that it belongs squarely in the College Football Playoff conversation, even if it does lose a game during the regular season. Remember, in order to blow late leads over Alabama in crushing fashion, you first have to get late leads over Alabama — and the only other team that can say it has done that recently is Clemson. The Bulldogs have proven they can hang with the game’s top programs, and they have the talent to do it again. Now it’s up to Smart, Fromm and company to finally turn that potential into championship results this season.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/no-bringing-back-mental-institutions-wont-stop-mass-shootings/,2019-08-27,,,features,"Aug. 27, 2019","No, Bringing Back Mental Institutions Won’t Stop Mass Shootings",Maggie Koerth,FiveThirtyEight,Gun Violence,"I have a mental health problem. A couple of them, actually. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is the big one. I was diagnosed at 26 and take medication daily for that. I also have some mild depression that comes and goes and is currently settled down on the couch with its shoes off.
But it’s nice to know I’m not alone. Nearly 47 million American adults — about 19 percent of us — deal with a mental illness of some sort. Serious mental illness, the kind that can keep people from being able to do normal life activities, is also pretty common: It affects 11 million American adults. Even with a specific, uncommon diagnosis like schizophrenia, you’re still talking about (at the low end of the estimates) some half a million Americans.
Almost none of us are mass shooters.
After the recent mass shootings this summer, President Trump said mental illness is a cause of violence and could be a predictive tool for spotting dangerous people. But that won’t work — there are just too many people who “fit the description” and too much confusion about what “the description” even means.
Take, for instance, the links between suicide and mass violence. Last week, I wrote a story about researchers’ findings that many mass shooters are also suicidal. None of this research compared perpetrators of mass violence to the general population, which is just the first of many reasons that the presence or absence of suicidal thoughts is not a great way to predict who will become dangerous. After the article was published, several readers asked me whether those findings meant that President Trump was right to blame mass shootings on mental illness and see institutionalization as a solution.
Short answer: Nope. He wasn’t.
First, you’ve got a problem with the statistics. There is evidence that people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, do commit acts of violence at a greater rate than people who don’t suffer from those disorders. But that comes with some really big asterisks.
A couple studies have shown that most or all of that difference can be accounted for by whether or not the people in question have a substance abuse problem on top of everything else. And, more importantly, the difference is still so modest that it’s kind of useless as a predictor of violence. So, for instance, a 2011 study involving a survey of more than 34,000 people found that 10 percent of people with both a serious mental illness and a substance abuse disorder committed an act of violence in a given year — compared to about 0.8 percent of people with neither issue. But that still leaves a lot of nonviolent, mentally ill addicts in the world — enough that using those two factors alone as your predictor of violence would make you wrong nine times out of 10.
And that counts all types of violence — these totals don’t distinguish between, say, bar fights, throwing something at a roommate and threatening someone with a knife. Your likelihood of being wrong about someone’s propensity for violence goes up even more when you’re talking about specific, very rare types of violence like mass shootings.
Which brings us to our second problem: The definitional one. What does mental illness mean to you? Existing gun background checks and the president’s statements imply that the risks come from people with serious disorders, the kind of thing that we used to put people in institutions for. But that’s not what’s turning up as a characteristic among mass shooters. Instead, mass shooters often have the kind of mental health problems that are much more common and prosaic — plain old depression, personal crises, poor coping skills, and thoughts of or attempts at suicide.
Potential mass shooters aren’t easy to spot, but the contradictions in our logic about them are:
The kinds of severe mental illnesses we’re so often afraid of don’t seem to be strongly associated with mass violence.
The serious mental illnesses that are loosely linked with violence are still a poor predictor of who will become violent.
The mental illnesses that seem to be common among people who commit mass violence aren’t good predictors of violence.
And we have no idea how people who commit mass violence differ from the general population — we only know what they have in common with each other.
You can see the problem. This is why experts say we shouldn’t be talking about mental illness as a cause of mass violence.
Americans would certainly benefit from being able to more easily and cheaply see a therapist or get mental health treatment when they need it. And the researchers I spoke with for my recent article do think access to that kind of care would reduce mass violence by helping some of the tiny fraction of people who might otherwise turn a suicidal tendency into a homical one.
But that’s not the same thing as saying that a diagnosis will help you find the Americans who are bad and scary and dangerous. And it’s certainly not the same thing as saying that you can prevent mass violence by taking those people and locking them away in an institution.
Just ask me. And nearly 47 million other Americans.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

The reactions that ensued from players, pundits and fans were swift and varied. Some lauded Luck for making a brave choice. Others chose to paint him as a selfish millennial. We dive into Luck’s unprecedented decision, the role of the media in its depiction and the potential ramifications for the NFL.
Another athlete currently making waves is MLB phenom Mike Trout. One of the few accomplishments that appears out of reach for Trout — at least for the moment — is a championship title. We discuss Trout’s unique predicament and how the history books might ultimately judge his record.
In honor of the 20th anniversary of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater video game, we reflect on the game that ignited an entire extreme sports video game market.

Not only must they flip four currently Republican-held seats,1 but they must also prevent Republicans from picking up any seats of their own. And the GOP already has good shots at making gains in Alabama (thanks to the state’s deep Republican lean) and Michigan (thanks to a strong candidate).
Republicans’ next-best pickup opportunity — at least according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric, which measures how much more Democratic- or Republican-leaning a place is than the country as a whole2 — is New Hampshire. And in recent weeks, a well-known Trump ally has signaled that he’s interested in running: Corey Lewandowski, the original manager of President Trump’s 2016 campaign. This, however, is not a welcome development to many Republicans, who think Lewandowski would torpedo their chances of flipping the seat. But I don’t think it’s quite that cut-and-dried — those inside Trump’s and Lewandowski’s inner circles also have some valid arguments for why Lewandowski may be the right candidate for the job (more on that in a moment).
First, election handicappers are split on how vulnerable New Hampshire’s Senate seat is. The Cook Political Report rates the race as “Solid Democratic”; Inside Elections thinks the race is a bit more competitive, rating it as “Likely Democratic”; and Sabato’s Crystal Ball puts it one step away from a toss-up at “Leans Democratic.” But the one thing they do agree on is that Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is currently favored. And Shaheen is a formidable incumbent: She was one of the few vulnerable Democratic senators to survive the 2014 Republican wave, defeating former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown by 3 percentage points. According to Morning Consult, she also has a +20 net approval rating3 despite residing in a slightly Republican-leaning state (according to FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric). That gives her one of the nation’s best Popularity Above Replacement Senator scores, a measure of senators’ cross-party appeal. As a result, I would expect her to run ahead of the Democratic presidential nominee in New Hampshire when both are on the ballot in 2020. In other words, I’d only expect her to be in danger if it looks like Trump will carry New Hampshire by a comfortable margin.
Three Republicans are already running against Shaheen, including retired Brigadier General Don Bolduc and former state House Speaker Bill O’Brien. But if Lewandowski runs, he could brush them aside easily in a Republican primary. Although he was fired as Trump’s campaign manager, Lewandowski is still close to the president. During a visit to New Hampshire this month, Trump told an interviewer, “Corey’s an outstanding guy. If he ran and won, he would be a great senator.” And if Lewandowski receives Trump’s formal endorsement, he would be a near lock for the nomination. When we analyzed Republican primaries in 2018, we found that candidates whom Trump endorsed won nearly all of their races; in fact, his endorsement was more correlated with primary victory than any other factor we examined.
But the general election might be a different story. Many Republicans, including Gov. Chris Sununu, worry that Lewandowski’s candidacy would go down like a lead balloon with the general electorate. Sununu is up for reelection in 2020 and is reportedly concerned that Lewandowski would drag down Republicans in other races. And the concern is not necessarily misplaced; Lewandowski does have plenty of flaws as a candidate. The Democratic PAC American Bridge has called him “an opposition researcher’s dream candidate.” And according to The Washington Post, New Hampshire Democrats have already prepared a 25-page report on Lewandowski’s past career as a lobbyist. In 2016, Lewandowski was also charged with battery after forcefully grabbing a reporter who was trying to ask Trump a question. The charges were dropped, but video of the encounter may continue to haunt him. Not to mention, Lewandowski remains closely associated with Trump and shares his former boss’s inflammatory style, both of which could backfire, as Trump is not particularly popular among Granite Staters. (Morning Consult gives Trump a -17 net approval rating in New Hampshire despite its light-red hue.)
On the other hand, one can make a case for Lewandowski’s electability as well. First, his national profile and connections to Trumpworld would ensure he is well-funded. Second, I’m not sure his association with Trump is a bad thing in a race where Republicans start out as underdogs. Establishment Republicans’ criticism of Lewandowski boils down to, in Politico’s words, “he would do little to help the party expand its base beyond the group of voters that Trump is already expected to attract.” But this is an odd critique in a Republican-leaning state that Trump may very well carry. In fact, all the major handicappers see the presidential race in New Hampshire as being more competitive than the Senate race, probably because Shaheen’s aforementioned popularity makes her seat a safer bet for Democrats.4 If that’s true, then Republicans should want to nationalize the race, as their best chance of winning may be for every Trump voter to vote for a Republican Senate candidate as well. Given that he is essentially a down-ballot version of Trump, Lewandowski may be the best candidate to make sure GOP-leaning Granite Staters vote a straight ticket.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

4th candidate
In what is quickly becoming a regular and dirgeful drumbeat, another Democratic presidential candidate dropped out of the 2020 primary race. Late last week, it was Boston-area Rep. Seth Moulton’s turn, and he joins California Rep. Eric Swalwell, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on the sidelines. Don’t worry, there’s still some 20 Democrats left in the game, and many more such Significant Digits entries to come. [CNN]
362 runs
In a Test cricket match at Headingley Cricket Ground yesterday — one full of “astounding melodrama” and featuring “the innings of a lifetime” per The Guardian — England defeated Australia to keep the Ashes series alive. England scored 362 for nine, its highest-ever winning score. The English cricketer Ben Stokes led the team to victory scoring 135, including eight sixes (think, like, home runs), which is a lot of sixes. (I warned you this was a cricket column now.) [The Guardian]
44,000 troops
Some 44,000 troops have prepared to deploy in the Amazon rainforest, which is burning. They are part of an “unprecedented” operation to fight the wildfires, which will begin with a deployment of 700 troops and will see troops deployed to six Brazilian states. Fires in the rainforest are up 85 percent from the same time last year. [CBS News]
6 people injured
Six spectators were injured over the weekend when lightning struck at the PGA’s Tour Championship, shattering a pine tree’s bark and sending debris into the crowd. The injured were treated and released. The golf play was halted at the time, and the players and many spectators had already cleared the course. [ESPN]
79 AV
The Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck is retiring, reportedly because he is “mentally worn down.” Luck, 29, has little historical company in retiring so young and so good. He is second all-time in AV — that’s Approximate Value, a method for capturing a player’s value in a single number — among quarterbacks who didn’t play again after their age-29 seasons, barely trailing Neil Lomax, who was forced to retire because of an arthritic hip. [FiveThirtyEight]
60 square miles
Earlier this month, sailors discovered a “huge raft” made of pumice floating toward Australia. Created by an underwater volcano, the raft is some 60 square miles in size, or about the size of Washington, D.C. As it drifts, it will become the new home for countless marine organisms, and there is hope that it will bring a needed, healthy injection of life to the Great Barrier Reef. [The Weather Channel]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/joe-biden-has-an-iowa-problem-not-an-enthusiasm-problem/,2019-08-26,,,features,"Aug. 26, 2019","Joe Biden Has An Iowa Problem, Not An Enthusiasm Problem",Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"If you’ve been following our coverage of the Democratic primary, you’ll know that I don’t think much of media really understands Joe Biden’s popularity among Democrats. That doesn’t mean that Biden is destined to win the primary. In fact, I’d regard him as an underdog relative to the field — that is, I think he has a less than 50 percent chance of getting the nomination — partly for reasons I’ll outline later on in this column. But there have already been several occasions when despite widespread predictions of Biden’s demise, the former vice president rebounded or held steady in the polls.
Furthermore — not totally unlike Donald Trump four years ago — Biden’s support comes mostly from the type of Democrats who are sometimes relatively invisible in media coverage of the campaigns, such as black Democrats and older Democrats without college degrees. That’s another reason to be skeptical about claims that Biden isn’t as popular as polls seem to imply. They sometimes reflect narratives that are filtered through journalists’ college-educated social environments — or conditioned by conversations on social media — with all the implicit biases those can introduce.
So this article about Biden in The New York Times, which alleged a disconnect between the polls and conditions on the ground In Iowa, was a little dismaying for me. Here’s a representative snippet:
But less than two weeks before Labor Day, when presidential campaigns traditionally kick into high gear, there are signs of a disconnect between his relatively rosy poll numbers and excitement for his campaign on the ground here [in Iowa], in the state that begins the presidential nominating process.
The thing is, I actually think the Times is onto something here! But it’s something you can see in the polls. And it’s something that probably has a lot to do with Iowa, where the article was datelined from — and where there are relatively few voters from among the groups that are most enthusiastic about Biden.
One straightforward way for a poll to detect voter enthusiasm is simply for it to ask voters how strongly they feel about a particular candidate. Many polls, for example, ask voters whether they have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable view of the candidates. If the Times’s hypothesis is correct about Biden, we’d expect to see a lot of lukewarm support for him — plenty of voters in the “somewhat favorable” category, but relatively few in the “very favorable” bucket.
That’s not really what national polls show, though. I averaged data from the four polls I can find that were conducted after the Detroit debate — from Morning Consult, YouGov, HarrisX and Fox News1 — that asked Democratic voters the four-pronged favorability question I described above. By this measure, Biden had just as much enthusiastic support as any other Democrat. In the polling average, 36 percent of Democrats had a very or strongly favorable view of Biden, essentially the same as for Bernie Sanders (37 percent) and Elizabeth Warren (36 percent) and well ahead of the next Democrat, Kamala Harris, at 26 percent.2

“Strongly” includes respondents who answered “very strongly”

Now, because more voters list Biden as their first choice than list Sanders or Warren, he probably does have his fair share of begrudging supporters. But it’s a fallacy to say that Biden doesn’t have enthusiastic supporters also. According to national polls, he has plenty — about as many as Sanders or Warren. On top of that, he also gets support from other Democrats who are less enthusiastic but support him for other reasons, e.g. electability. Those two paths to support are why Biden’s polling at almost 30 percent while Sanders and Warren are closer to 15 percent.

*Refers to Democrats who say they are paying “a lot” of attention to the campaign
Source: polls
Furthermore, Biden does plenty well with the most attentive voters, which isn’t quite the same thing as enthusiasm but is certainly related to it. (And in any event, it’s a bullish indicator since the most attentive voters are more likely to eventually vote.) Quinnipiac has routinely been asking Democrats how much attention they’re paying to the campaign and breaking out results on that basis. In the table to the left, you can see how that data looks in an average of their last three national polls, dating back to July.
Biden gets 30 percent of the vote among Democrats who say they’re paying “a lot” of attention to the campaign, essentially the same as the 29 percent support he has from Democrats overall in Quinnipiac’s polling. Warren and Kamala Harris do gain some ground among the most attentive voters — while Sanders loses some ground. But still, Biden tops the field among voters in that category.
If you look at polls of Iowa, though, you see more evidence of an actual enthusiasm deficit for Biden. Unfortunately, there are no especially recent polls of Iowa that asked the four-pronged favorability question of Democratic voters. But there are some from June and July that did, namely a Selzer & Co. poll for CNN and the Des Moines Register, a Change Research poll and a David Binder Research poll.3

Average of Iowa polls from Selzer & Co., Change Research and David Binder Research. Totals may not add up exactly due to rounding.
“Strongly” includes respondents who answered “very strongly”
Source: Polls
Biden’s numbers are OK in Iowa, but not great. Some 31 percent of Democrats say they have a very or strongly favorable view of him, which is essentially tied with Sanders for fourth place in the field. By comparison, 46 percent of Iowa Democrats have a strongly favorable view of Warren. (And remember, these polls are a couple of months old — she’s gained ground in most national and early-state polls since then.) Meanwhile, 40 percent also have a strongly favorable view of Harris and Pete Buttigieg.
Whenever we see a divergence between Iowa polls and national polls, the question is whether it has something to do with Iowa’s demographics or, rather, the fact that the campaign is more active in Iowa than it is nationally. If the differences are demographic in nature, then Biden might not have as much to worry about — the Democrats who turn out to caucus in Iowa are white and liberal, whereas he overperforms among nonwhite and moderate Democrats, who make up bigger parts of the electorate in states such as South Carolina and most of the Super Tuesday states. Alternatively, if Biden’s numbers are middling in Iowa because voters don’t like him as much upon prolonged exposure to him, that could mean it’s more of a canary in the coal mine, and that voters in other states will tire of Biden once they begin paying more attention to the campaign.
These explanations aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive — but on balance, the demographic hypothesis is more persuasive in Biden’s case. In 2016, 91 percent of Iowa’s Democratic caucus electorate was white, as compared to around 60 percent nationally in the Democratic primaries. And almost 70 percent of voters there identified as liberal, as compared to about 50 percent nationally. Those are big differences, and not ones that are favorable for Biden’s coalition, so it’s reasonable to expect he might be doing quite a bit worse there than he is nationally. Furthermore, as I mentioned, national polls show Biden doing just as well with highly attentive voters as with voters overall, which should also lead us to discount the canary-in-the-coal-mine hypothesis.
Actually, the candidate who should be really worried about his Iowa numbers is Sanders. Iowa’s demographics should boost his coalition, but his favorability numbers are just as lukewarm as Biden’s there.
But getting back to Biden: Even if his issues in Iowa are mostly linked to demographics, the state could still be a major concern for him. That’s because Iowa can affect the result of every state that votes after it. These effects seem to have dampened in recent election cycles. (Just ask Ted Cruz or Mike Huckabee — or, for that matter, Barack Obama — how much winning Iowa helped them in New Hampshire.) Nonetheless, to the extent that some of Biden’s support is predicated on electability, some of it could erode if voters see him take a big loss.
Biden may already be trailing in Iowa, in fact. Among the last seven polls there — everything since the first debate in Miami — three have shown Biden leads, but two have had Warren ahead, along with one Biden/Warren tie and one Buttigieg lead. If you combine those top-line polls with the enthusiasm numbers, plus Warren’s strong ground game in Iowa, you can argue that the state is Warren’s to lose more than Biden’s.
Still, the story is a lot more complicated than a cliched narrative about voters choosing heart (Warren/Sanders) over head (Biden), or voting for Biden only through gritted teeth. Biden has plenty of enthusiastic support. But he has less of it in Iowa, and that could be a big problem for him.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-las-vegas-aces-are-quietly-carving-out-an-identity/,2019-08-26,,,features,"Aug. 26, 2019",The Las Vegas Aces Are Quietly Carving Out An Identity,Chris Herring,FiveThirtyEight,WNBA,"From the moment they dealt for elite scorer Liz Cambage, the Las Vegas Aces became perhaps the WNBA’s most compelling team — not necessarily the best team, but certainly one with enough upside to make that claim by year’s end.1
Headlined by three All-Stars — Cambage, A’ja Wilson and Kayla McBride — the Aces’ top-five offense understandably gets a ton of attention. Yet because of that firepower, the Las Vegas defense, one of the WNBA’s worst a year ago, has been overlooked. But the Aces’ defense has made an about-face, becoming one of the more rugged units en route to putting up league-best numbers this season.
Vegas is almost 1.5 points per 100 possessions better on D than the next closest team, and have managed to be stingy on that end despite playing at the second-fastest pace in the league. Opposing teams take, on average, almost 16 seconds per possession to get off shot against the Aces, the longest average in the WNBA. And once the shots actually go up, the most likely outcome is a miss (Vegas has the best effective field goal percentage defense) and an Aces’ rebound (they also have the best defensive-rebounding percentage).
Aces coach Bill Laimbeer told me before a recent game that he challenged a pair of returning wing players, McBride and former No. 1 overall pick Kelsey Plum, to push up farther on ball-handlers this season. Aside from forcing the action, doing so would tempt teams to either drive or throw the ball into the paint, where both Wilson and the 6-foot-8 Cambage combine for three blocks per contest. Indeed, teams have had limited success inside against the Aces this season, scoring a league-low .971 points per possession around the basket, according to Synergy Sports.
On some level, Vegas’s almost-overnight shift into a top-tier defensive unit was by design. If the defense can keep opponents off the board for stretches, Laimbeer’s thinking went, it would allow more time for the Aces’ offensive pieces to jell, and for the team’s talent advantage to take over. “Defense is much easier than offense — it’s just hard work and structure,” Laimbeer said. “You simply put the structure in, and demand that the players work hard.”
McBride said the team has bought into adopting a grittier, more prideful identity since last season. One example: If Las Vegas goes a couple possessions in a row without scoring — which often discourages players who thrive on their offense — coaches often shout from the sidelines, “If we don’t score, they don’t score,” to remind the Aces not to let off the pedal on the defensive end.
“I think a lot of it comes from [Laimbeer],” McBride said of developing a far greater intensity on defense. “We embrace it, and I think we kind of like the idea of becoming the villains of the league.”
While the Aces have been solid defensively all year,2 untangling the offense has been more of a challenge. The Aces recently clinched their first playoff berth since 2014,3 but getting there has required pretty considerable sacrifices on offense from just about everyone on the roster. Earlier this month, we wrote that virtually every veteran on the team has gotten fewer shot attempts than she did last season, the price of playing on the lone WNBA team with three All-Stars. A decent comparison for this club is the first season of the LeBron-Wade-Bosh Miami Heat run. The offense — with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade taking turns holding the reins — wasn’t ideal at first. But the Heat’s defense was far better than expected, and helped lift the team to a Finals appearance during the trio’s first season together.
In an effort to avoid those getting-to-know-you pitfalls,4 Las Vegas has been trying to push the ball when it can. Aside from the addition of Cambage, the quick-strike mentality also stems from trying to simplify things for rookie and No. 1 overall pick Jackie Young, who’s adjusting to playing the lead guard position full-time as Plum, the NCAA women’s all-time leading scorer, adjusts to playing off-ball more. (There’s a steep dropoff in true-shooting percentage from Cambage, Wilson and McBride to Young and Plum, highlighting how top-heavy the frontcourt is.)
“When you have nights where the whole starting five is in double figures, you don’t have to worry about the offense,” Cambage said. “Clearly we’re doing something right. For us, it’s more about defense.”
This isn’t to suggest that the Vegas defense doesn’t have some shortcomings. Some were on display in Minnesota on Sunday, when the Aces surrendered 98 points in a loss to the Lynx. Napheesa Collier slipped undetected behind the Aces’ D multiple times in the third quarter (Las Vegas ranks dead last out of 12 teams in defending cuts to the basket, per Synergy). And Minnesota took advantage of Vegas not getting back in transition, where the Aces rank just ninth. Put another way: The Aces get caught sleeping from time to time.
But what makes the Aces intriguing is that, less than two weeks out from the playoffs, they’re still getting on the same page. Cambage joined the team eight days before the season started, giving her almost no opportunity to get acclimated, while Wilson recently missed a month with an injury. Young and Plum have had months to work off each other at this point, and even if the youth in the backcourt is a concern, it’s a safe bet that far more of the offense — particularly with 1-on-1 play, where the Aces rank best in the league, per Synergy — will go through Cambage and Wilson.
Also important to remember: This is just Year One for this relatively young team. Cambage, who turned 28 last week, is the oldest core player on the team. McBride is 27. Plum is 25, as is Sixth Woman of the Year candidate Dearica Hamby. Wilson is 23. Young is still just 21.
It could all come together quickly for this youthful club. But even if it takes beyond this season, the logic in tightening up the defense to buy more time for the already-solid offense was sound. Finishing at or near the top of the league on D in the first year together sets a new standard, and shows there’s no reason the Aces can’t be elite on both ends as long as this core stays together.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Bernie Sanders was the most-mentioned candidate in online news. According to data from Media Cloud,1 a database of online news stories, Sanders was mentioned in about 45 percent of online news stories that mentioned any 2020 Democratic hopeful, up 11 percentage points from the week prior. Some of that coverage focused on a series of proposals Sanders released last week on topics ranging from combating climate change to supporting labor unions to reforming the criminal justice system: For example, 26 percent of online stories that mentioned Sanders also included the word “climate.”
But according to data from the TV News Archive,2 the share of cable news clips that mention Sanders across the three networks we monitor — CNN, Fox News and MSNBC — barely changed. Instead, it was former Vice President Joe Biden who saw his cable news mentions increase by almost 10 percentage points between last week and the week prior.

Each network’s daily news coverage is chopped up into 15-second clips, and each clip that includes a candidate’s name is counted as one mention. For both cable and online news, our search queries look for an exact match for each candidate’s name, except for Julian Castro, for whom our search query is “Julian Castro” OR “Julián Castro.” Media Cloud searches use two of the database’s publication lists: “top online news” and “digital native” publications.

That’s consistent with a pattern that we’ve seen for a few weeks now. Since July, Biden has continued to dominate in cable news mentions but has not always been the most-mentioned candidate online, sharing the spotlight with Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who were both mentioned more than Biden last week. While Warren was not the most-mentioned candidate on either medium, she continued her recent steady rise in media attention. Warren was mentioned in a larger share of both cable news clips and online news stories compared to the week prior, and was once again mentioned in a larger share of cable news clips than since at least April, when FiveThirtyEight began to track cable news mentions.
Regardless of which medium we examine, Biden, Sanders, and Warren have consistently been getting more media coverage than the rest of the field since the last Democratic primary debate.3 The same can’t be said for other candidates. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton were the only two other candidates who got noticeably more media mentions on both online and cable news last week. When all else fails, you can always get the media’s attention by dropping out of the race, apparently.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/demarcus-cousinss-latest-injury-puts-him-in-uncharted-territory/,2019-08-25,,,features,"Aug. 19, 2019",DeMarcus Cousins’s Career Is In Jeopardy,Chris Herring,FiveThirtyEight,Basketball,"If you’ve logged off the NBA circuit for the summer — understandable given how crazy last month was, and how insane this upcoming season figures to be — you might have missed that DeMarcus Cousins of the Los Angeles Lakers suffered yet another serious injury, tearing his ACL in an offseason workout last week.
Rewinding 20 months, it would have seemed unfathomable for a contender to lose someone of Cousins’s caliber without the injury sending shockwaves through the entire league. But now — with three major leg injuries to Cousins in that window — teams will likely be even more reluctant about trusting Boogie’s body to hold up over a full season. All of which begs the question: What now for the highly skilled center, who just turned 29 last week?
Cousins’s age and position alone would seem to make him an appealing option for any number of clubs, once he recovers and gets back into playing shape. But what “playing shape” looks like for Cousins is a tough question to answer. There are all sorts of concerns that smaller guards face when recovering from an Achilles rupture, and those challenges become even bigger in a 6-foot-11, 270-pound center’s frame. The league has seen few players like him over time, and almost certainly none have had this many serious leg injuries in such a short span of time.
Jeff Stotts, who runs In Street Clothes, a site that closely analyzes the NBA’s injury data from year to year, said he couldn’t find a single instance of a player rupturing both an Achilles and an ACL, as Cousins has.1 “There have been a few players to tear their ACL multiple times,” he said, citing Jabari Parker and former players Josh Howard and Michael Redd. “But nothing of [Cousins’s magnitude].”2
Stotts said he couldn’t even find an example of a player who had torn both an ACL and Achilles tendon in other sports, either. There is a clear distinction between Cousins and players who experience recurring problems like Brook Lopez’s foot issues, Gilbert Arenas’s knee problems or Steph Curry’s ankle ailments, Stotts said. The closest comparison to Cousins that Stotts could offer: Joel Embiid, who missed the 2014 and 2015 seasons due to a right foot fracture before tearing his left meniscus in 2017. (Former MVP Derrick Rose — who in a five-year stretch tore his meniscus in both his right and left knees after tearing the ACL in his left knee — also comes to mind here.)
From a numbers standpoint, FiveThirtyEight’s projection model views the Cousins injury as a real blow for the Lakers, who last week saw their probability of reaching the NBA Finals and winning a title slide from 27 percent and 18 percent, respectively, to just 20 percent and 14 percent currently.
That might seem like a steep dropoff, but Cousins was still highly productive in the minutes he played last season when healthy for Golden State. His field-goal percentage, both overall and near the rim, were among the best he’s ever posted, and he logged a career-best block percentage on defense. There’s no telling how big a dropoff the Lakers might experience at the position yet, because depending on how the organization handles Anthony Davis (who’s already said he doesn’t like playing center), Los Angeles only has one experienced option at center without Cousins, and that’s JaVale McGee.
If there’s a sliver of hope for Cousins, it’s that — unlike other great players who’ve suffered brutal knee injuries — he’s never truly relied on his athleticism to be a star. A few years ago, while I questioned him for a story on why he gets blocked so often, Cousins said it wasn’t necessary to launch a Sherlock Holmes-style case. “It’s because I can’t jump,” he said.
Cousins is a fantastic passer, and has now logged an assist rate of better than 20 percent four of his last five seasons, putting him in pretty elite company for someone who stands as tall as he does.
In the past, he made mincemeat of post defenders, either by shooting over them (he’s been among the NBA’s 25 most efficient scorers in the post three years3 running, per Second Spectrum data), or by forcing double-teams and finding open teammates in the corner.
Yet the fact that Cousins has long thrived on his strength is cause for concern about this latest injury. If and when he can’t be as forceful in the post, will there be as much need for double-teams? And if those doubles don’t come — and if he’s not surrounded by the sort of spacing he had in Golden State last season — does it lessen what all he’ll be able to do as a passer? And none of this even touches on the obvious question of how these injuries might impact his defensive mobility. The league — which has over the past few years gotten shorter and quicker at center — has already become tougher for players like Cousins in recent seasons, and whatever rust develops as he’s rehabbing could amplify those challenges.
And to think: This time last year, Cousins’s choice to sign with the Warriors was seen as laughable by many, because of how much talent it would give Golden State. It’s mind-boggling to compare that scenario to how dry free-agent interest in him might be next summer, as teams raise inevitable questions about his health despite his undeniable talent. Another sign of how quickly things can change in a topsy-turvy NBA.

The not-so-proud recipients of the title of most average team in major pro sports? None other than the Pittsburgh Pirates, who would go on to finish with an almost-exactly .500 82-win record last season. Nothing so perfectly mediocre can ever last, though, and this year’s Pirates have slipped to 51-73 despite sitting within a game of .500 at the All-Star Break.1 So now we need to find a new champion in the field of undistinguished baseball. But maybe we can also build one for ourselves by assembling the most ordinary possible group of players in the game this year.
It’ll be a challenge, but we’re up for it.
First things first, let’s find the most mediocre real-life team of 2019. According to our method from last season, we need to search for the team who sticks closest to league average this season in each of the following categories (in descending order of importance):
Win-loss record. This is self-explanatory. Teams should get the most credit for sitting as close to .500 as possible in the standings.
Run differential. We also want our ideal average team to come to its record honestly. No lucking into a 81-81 record here.
Runs scored and allowed per game. The most middling team must be perfectly average on both offense and defense/pitching.
On-base percentage and slugging percentage, for and against. Finally, our vanilla victor must score and prevent its runs in the most conventional manner possible.
As you can see, no straying from the norm is allowed at any statistical level. And according to these rules,2 this year’s most average MLB club is… (drumroll please):

No 2019 team is as downright ordinary as the 2018 Pirates were, but that squad was tracking to go down as history’s Most Average Team™ — a tough act to follow. Although the Mets still have a 31 percent chance of making the playoffs after their recent hot streak, and the team has plenty of star power between Pete Alonso, Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and friends, New York remains an extremely average team in terms of its overall statistical profile.
At an individual level, the Mets also possess some of the most average players in baseball. If we use Wins Above Replacement3 to calculate how close a player is to the MLB average for a pitcher or position player given his playing time, we find that Mets position players Amed Rosario, Wilson Ramos, Todd Frazier, J.D. Davis and Dominic Smith have all been within a half-win of middling perfection. (That especially applies to Smith, whose 0.6 WAR is exactly what we’d expect of an average position player in the same playing time.)
The single most average player in all of baseball according to that metric, however, is Dodgers catcher Russell Martin, who is on pace for 0.85 WAR, or just 0.00097 wins above average given his position and share of L.A.’s plate appearances. He and Cincinnati Reds reliever Raisel Iglesias (-0.00591 wins above average) stand out as the players closest to a perfectly average WAR, among those who have logged at least 1.5 percent of their team’s playing time this season:4

Among those lineup mainstays with at least 5 percent of team playing time, a pair of American League Central pitchers emerge as extremely average: Jakob Junis of the Kansas City Royals and Reynaldo Lopez of the Chicago White Sox, both of whom have WARs within 0.040 of a league-average mark. Following them on the position player side are Dexter Fowler of the St. Louis Cardinals, Shin-Soo Choo of the Texas Rangers and Adam Eaton of the Washington Nationals — a trio of outfielders who will make a combined $45.9 million this season for their pure, concentrated averageness.
So those are the most average players in the game this season, and the Mets are the most average real-life team. But can we construct an All-Star Team of Average? Let’s build off the rankings above by creating the game’s most mediocre 25-man roster, within the following constraints:
The team must allocate roughly 58 percent of playing time to position players and 42 percent to pitchers, in accordance with the breakdown of league value found in WAR.5
No player whose WAR differs from average by more than +/- 0.1 wins can make the roster.
We’ll carry 13 hitters — starters at eight positions, plus additional slots for a middle infielder, a corner infielder, an outfielder, a catcher and a pinch-hitter/designated hitter/utility type — and 12 pitchers, including seven relievers.
A player’s eligibility at a position is based on ESPN’s fantasy rules: He must have played either 20 games at that position last season or 10 this season.
The team’s total WAR-projected record must be as close as possible to 81-81.
The team’s payroll must be as close as possible to the MLB average team payroll of $133,548,817.
After discarding combinations of players that fail to meet one or more of those qualifications, here is the absolute most average roster we could assemble using 2019 players:

The resulting team comes in with a projection for 33.4 WAR, which adds up to 81.1 wins per 162 games.6 It also comes in with a price tag just $273,316 above the MLB average payroll. (Hopefully we can get the owner to budge and give us the extra quarter-million.) It is the ultimate in cutting-edge average technology.
It is surprising to see some of the names that qualify for a team of the most average players. (Remember, everyone is within +/- 0.1 WAR of perfectly average.) Buster Posey is a future Hall of Fame catcher, but a down year with the bat has left him on pace for his fewest WAR (1.6) since 2011. Iglesias is tracking for another 30-save season, but his ERA has taken a hit after years of outpitching his peripherals. Vlad Guerrero Jr. looks like a future superstar,and he’s shown a great deal of improvement over the course of his rookie season, but his overall season-long numbers are just middle-of-the-road (in large part because of weak defensive metrics). Many of these players are merely passing through averagedom, either as a stop on their ascent or their decline.
As the great Bill James often wrote, talent in professional baseball is distributed like a pyramid — for every average player, there are many, many more who are below average or worse. We sometimes have a tendency to dismiss the average player as having no value. This is a mistake. It’s actually very difficult to be average, so average players actually offer a great deal of value. The outcome of the season hinges as much (or more) on teams getting an average performance, instead of a bad one, from their role players as it does on their top players playing like superstars. So whether it’s the real-life Mets or the members of our All-Average Team, we salute you: You are the glue that holds together the sport.

Not Anymore.",Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"Over the years, bullpens have eroded the workloads of starting pitchers. This season, relievers have accounted for the greatest share of pitching workload in Major League Baseball history: They have completed 41.1 percent of total innings through Wednesday, up from last year’s record of 40 percent. There are a variety of reasons for this trend, including teams becoming more aware of how starting pitchers tend to do worse each time through the opposing lineup and the increasing specialization of the sport.
For more than 40 years, relievers had outperformed starters on a per-inning basis. But this season, through Wednesday, starters’ ERA is 0.02 points lower than that of relievers. Starters have not posted an ERA superior to that of relievers since 1973, but that gap has shrunk rapidly, and this year it could be potentially erased. As recently as 2012, the overall ERA of relievers was half a run better than that of starting pitchers.

Perhaps this suggests that the sport has reached the limits of bullpenning and specialization — there are too many relievers employed. Through Tuesday, 492 different pitchers who primarily serve in relief have appeared in games this season.1 That already breaks the record set last season (488) and is up from 381 relievers in 2010 and 297 in 1998, the first season that MLB had 30 teams.
This change in personnel may explain relievers’ decline in performance the first time through opposing lineups, relative to starting pitchers, a trend that Ben Clemens at FanGraphs documented in May and has continued into the summer. For the first time this century, starters have been better than relievers in their first time through the order in back-to-back seasons. Craig Edwards, also of FanGraphs, found there have been more low-leverage innings this year and poorer performance within them,2 speaking to less meaningful baseball and more poor teams. Those innings have presumably been pitched by lesser relievers, diluting the group’s overall performance. There have been fewer meaningful innings this season — and also a greater volume of lesser-skilled relievers.
A key decision for managers in today’s game is deciding whether to stick with a starter a third time through the lineup or to use the bullpen. And the gap between starters in that position and relievers has shrunk to its lowest level since 2005, as relievers have an advantage of only 49 points of opponent OPS this season compared with a 64-point edge last season and a century-high, 88-point difference in 2007, according to Baseball-Reference.com.

Another reason for the convergence between starters and relievers is that starting pitchers are gaining relative skill. For the first time in the pitch-tracking era, which dates to 2007, the average fastball velocity of starting pitchers (93.3 mph) is less than 1 mph (0.8 mph) slower than that of relievers (94.1 mph). In 2012, relievers’ average fastballs were 1.7 mph faster than those of starters, and the difference has generally been shrinking since. Relievers’ overall fastball velocity has even declined this season, for the first time since 2008. Moreover, starters so far in 2019 have posted a higher difference between their strikeout rate and walk rate (14.5 percentage points) than relievers (13.9 percentage points). This is the first time starters have had a greater difference than relievers in the two rates since 1986.
New technology is also allowing pitchers to improve the efficiency of their pitches. Starting pitchers also generally have a greater variety of pitches — and better command — than relievers, which is arguably one reason why they are starting pitchers and not relievers. If starters close the velocity gap, where relievers have traditionally held an advantage, they are closing a significant portion of the performance divide.
Perhaps the game has swung too far in favor of relievers. Managers might want to wait a little longer on that call to the bullpen, or at least consider whom they are calling upon.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/remember-those-2003-tigers-this-years-team-might-be-even-worse/,2019-08-25,,,features,"Aug. 23, 2019",Remember Those 2003 Tigers? This Year’s Team Might Be Even Worse.,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"The 2003 Detroit Tigers were a shining beacon of bad baseball. This was true both as a team — they lost 119 games, the second-most of any MLB team since 19011 — and also at the individual level. Hapless starter Mike Maroth, for instance, became the only pitcher to lose 20 times in a season since 1980 (and perhaps the last ever to earn that not-so-proud distinction).
And yet, this year’s Tigers might be every bit as awful.
The FiveThirtyEight projection model thinks the 2019 Tigers will fall a bit short of the 2003 version’s loss total, predicting 111 defeats for Detroit by season’s end. But in terms of other measures, such as our Elo ratings, these Tigers are astonishingly close to their abysmal predecessors. Through 125 games, the Tigers have an Elo of 1398, which not only means Detroit has wrested the crown of “Worst Team in Baseball” away from the Baltimore Orioles — a title that once seemed impossible for the O’s to lose — but it also makes these Tigers just the 14th team ever to have an Elo under 1400 at this stage of a season. Their Elo is currently within striking distance of the 2003 team, which had a 1387 rating at this point in the schedule, and the current Tigers were slightly ahead of their ancestors in the race to baseball’s bottom as recently as eight games ago:

(All of this is true even after Detroit pulled off a shocking win over the Houston Astros Wednesday night, in one of the biggest upsets of the 21st century.)
It’s never good to be compared with that infamous 2003 squad — even if the current edition of the Tigers was intentionally built to “compete” with the Orioles and Miami Marlins for the No. 1 pick in next year’s draft. After years of enjoying superstar performances from Justin Verlander, Miguel Cabrera and Max Scherzer, Motor City fans were hoping they’d never again return to the days of Maroth, Bobby Higginson and Ramón Santiago. But history is repeating itself with the likes of Jordan Zimmermann, JaCoby Jones and Jeimer Candelario this year.
For their part, the 2003 Tigers were the culmination of a long, steady decline following the breakup of the mega-talented core that won the 1984 World Series (and posted at least 84 wins eight times between 1983 and 1993). After the 1993 Tigers went 85-77, the team wouldn’t go .500 again for another 13 years. An initial rebuild following the 1994 strike yielded 109 losses in 1996 — impressively bad, if mere child’s play compared with some Tiger seasons to come — and the payoff was a team that topped out at just 79 wins in both 1997 and 2000.
Then came one of the sharpest downturns in baseball history. Slugger Juan González — for whom the Tigers had traded a number of their best prospects just a year before — left the Tigers via free agency, the team was fleeced in a handful of trades, the farm system yielded little of note, and the rest of the players Detroit staked its future on (Higginson, Dean Palmer, Damion Easley, etc.) all stopped being productive. Over the four-season period from 2000 to 2003, Detroit’s record got progressively worse each year, by an average of 12 wins per season. By 2003, the Tigers were spending a combined $37 million (or 54 percent of the MLB median team payroll that season — the equivalent of $69 million today) on eight players2 who together generated 0.18 Wins Above Replacement.3 It was a masterclass in how to turn an average team into a 43-win one practically overnight.
The Tigers won five of their last six games to avoid tying the 1962 Mets’ record for futility. But they also needed bad luck to win so little in the first place. No MLB team truly contains 43-win talent — we think? — and the Tigers undershot the record we’d expect from their run differential by five wins in 2003, with another six-win deficit coming from the team’s run differential falling short of its underlying metrics. Add in even more bad luck from players unexpectedly producing career-low numbers,4 and the 2003 Tigers were probably a team with 55-to-65 win talent and some of the worst luck in baseball history. Manager Alan Trammell, a Tigers legend as a player, deserved better than to manage such a notoriously cursed season of Detroit baseball.
A few teams have come close to matching the ‘03 Tigers ineptitude in the years that followed. The very next season, the Arizona Diamondbacks lost 111 games, just three years removed from winning the World Series. The 2013 Astros (111 losses) and 2018 Orioles (115) also made valiant runs at the Mets’ record this decade. In fact, the recent prevalence of tanking teams has created more historically awful teams than ever before: This season alone, our model thinks four teams — the Marlins, Royals, Orioles and Tigers — will each lose more than 100 games.
Detroit’s current path to horrendousness was similar — if slightly more straightforward — than the one the team followed 16 years ago. These Tigers were also coming off a period of sustained success, with MLB’s fourth-best record from 2009 through 2014 and three consecutive League Championship Series appearances in 2011, 2012 and 2013 (including an AL pennant in 2012). But by the end of that stretch, Detroit found itself with an old, expensive roster and a bunch of money committed to veteran stars like Cabrera and Verlander. (Though not Scherzer, oddly enough. Then-general manager Dave Dombrowski let Scherzer walk to the Washington Nationals after the 2014 season; all Scherzer has done since then is lead all MLB pitchers in WAR.)
After a downturn to start the 2015 season, in which they would finish finish 74-87, Dombrowski unloaded recently-acquired stars David Price and Yoenis Cespedes at the trade deadline and then was eventually relieved of GM duties himself. The Tigers regrouped for one last bid with an aging core in 2016. It worked, to the extent Detroit had a winning record (86-75) again. But the team missed the playoffs by three games despite once again having one of the highest payrolls in baseball. And when the wheels fell off for good in the summer of 2017, the fire sale was on; midseason deals sent away Verlander, J.D. Martinez, Justin Upton, Alex Avila, Justin Wilson and pretty much anybody else who wasn’t nailed down.

Maybe the Tigers held out for too long before hitting the reset button, trying to extend their window beyond the point of reason. But once it began, this was a conventional rebuild — Detroit flipped their desirable veterans for prospects like teams are supposed to do. Early on, though, the prospects haven’t provided much in return. Of the 17 prospects acquired, only four have made the majors so far, and only one — third baseman Isaac Paredes (acquired from the Cubs) — ranks among the team’s top five prospects according to Baseball America. Most of the prospects are still young, so there’s plenty of time for them to add value in Detroit uniforms. For now, those young Tigers have a lot of ground to make up for the team to break even on its fire-sale deals.
Perhaps relatedly, going into the 2019 season, Baseball America ranked the Tigers’ farm system as the 14th-best in baseball. On the one hand, that’s the highest organizational ranking Detroit has had since 2007 and a major improvement after the team ranked among the bottom six nine times between 2008 and 2017. (Blowing up a minor-league system to keep the big-league team competitive is a Dombrowski specialty.) But it’s also behind schedule for the type of total teardowns the Tigers are trying to emulate, such as those executed by the Astros and Chicago Cubs earlier this decade. By the same stage in their respective rebuilds — judging by when each team dipped below 70 wins for the first time in its ramp-up towards contention — the Astros had MLB’s ninth-best system and the Cubs ranked fourth:

Detroit’s current farm system ranking improved to 13th after its midseason deals this year, and that’s roughly where the Tigers were (12th) back in 2003. The core of that young group — led by Curtis Granderson — played a big role in leading Detroit to a surprise World Series appearance within three years of its 119-loss catastrophe. That model might be a good one for the Tigers to follow when they are finally ready to compete again. But it’s also worth wondering whether bottoming out has the same competitive advantage now that so many other teams are also doing it. When the Tigers lost 119 games, by contrast, that was 20 more than any other team in baseball. The ‘03 Tigers didn’t mean to build one of the worst teams ever, but the 2019 version can’t make that case as convincingly — and neither can the Orioles or Marlins. Nor can this year’s team claim anywhere near as bad luck as in 2003.
As it stands now, the Tigers are currently in the driver’s seat when it comes to the race for next year’s No. 1 draft pick. Though they’ve built one of the worst teams of all time, it will all be worth it if they can use the picks and prospects to get back to the World Series quickly, just like the Cubs and Astros — or even an earlier version of the Tigers — did not so long ago. But if not, are all the losses be worth it? Because no one fan base should be forced to watch multiple 110-loss seasons in the span of 16 years without some World Series swag to show for it.

Filed to ESPN: Andrew Luck has informed the Colts he is retiring from the NFL, per source. There will be a press conference Sunday to make it official, but Luck is mentally worn down, and now checking out.
— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) August 25, 2019

(And here we were thinking that Antonio Brown was the NFL superstar most likely to retire abruptly this preseason…)
Luck, who won’t turn 30 until September, had already compiled one of the greatest-ever starts to a quarterback career. The No. 1 overall pick from the 2012 draft picked up the reins from the recently departed Peyton Manning in Indianapolis and immediately led the Colts to the playoffs in his first three seasons, reaching the AFC Championship in the 2014 season. But injuries soon disrupted his storybook narrative. He missed more than half of the 2015 season with a string of injuries and all of 2017 after undergoing shoulder surgery. Prior to Saturday’s announcement, he had sat out all of preseason due to a lingering leg injury.
When he was on the field, though, the numbers spoke for themselves. Through his age-29 season,1 Luck already had the 84th-most yards, 68th-most touchdowns and 95th-most Approximate Value (AV)2 of any passer in NFL history. Just looking at seasons before age 30, Luck had about the same AV as John Elway, Joe Montana and Tom Brady:

And that number might be understating Luck’s value. Because he missed so many games, he averaged 14.7 AV per 16 starts through age 29, the 19th-most of anyone on the list above, and more than contemporaries like Drew Brees, Ben Roethlisberger and Brady.
Luck shined in other metrics as well. As ProFootballFocus noted after the news of Luck’s retirement, he was a fixture atop their player grades, which try to measure player performance independent of teammate contributions. (Last season, he ranked third in the NFL behind Brees and Patrick Mahomes.) According to ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating, Luck ranked fifth last season; for their part, Football Outsiders ranked him seventh in total value.
We’ve seen stars at other positions, like wide receiver Calvin Johnson (who retired after his age-30 season) and tight end Rob Gronkowski (age 29) walk away from the NFL in their primes. But it is exceedingly rare for a quarterback of Luck’s caliber to leave the game before age 30. If we limit our ranking above to quarterbacks who never played another game after their age-29 season, Luck has the second-most career AV, coming in ahead of former 49ers QB Colin Kaepernick — whose exile from the NFL was not by choice — and trailing only ex-Cardinals starter Neil Lomax:

Unlike Kaepernick, who probably still could play if given the chance (hello, Colts?), Lomax was forced to retire young because of an arthritic hip. He’s not a player many remember nowadays, but he was a Pro Bowler twice, and he led the NFL in passing yards in 1987. Beyond him, Luck and Kaepernick, it’s hard to find any other comparable examples of good QBs who never played a down in their 30s. That’s a big part of what makes Luck’s abrupt decision to walk away from the game on the eve of the 2019 season so surprising.
Now the Colts will have to move on without one of the best quarterbacks in the league. With Luck — and his +208 QB rating (relative to a replacement-level undrafted rookie) in our new quarterback-adjusted Elo rating system — we had the Colts rated as the ninth-best team in the NFL, with a 1564 rating (which roughly equates to 9.2 wins per 16 games against a typical schedule). Now they’ll be left with Jacoby Brissett, whose Elo value over replacement is +108.3 That drop-off leaves the Colts rated with a 1479 Elo, which ranks only 21st in the league and carries an expectation of 7.5 wins against an average schedule.
But Luck ultimately made his decision, which he called the hardest of his life, because he had lost his love for the game. “I haven’t been able to live the life I want to live,” he said Saturday night. “It’s taken the joy out of this game … the only way forward for me is to remove myself from football.” The result is a huge loss — for the Colts, but also for a league that will be missing one of the most promising young quarterbacks to ever play the game.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-6.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-does-invoking-the-25th-amendment-actually-look-like/,2019-08-23,,,features,"Apr. 19, 2018",What Does Invoking The 25th Amendment Actually Look Like?,Julia Azari,FiveThirtyEight,Donald Trump,"Television shows are writing the 25th Amendment into their ripped-from-the-headlines storylines. Pundits debate the possibilities of the removal and succession of the president if he is incapacitated. Even former FBI Director James Comey has weighed in on whether Donald Trump is “medically unfit to be president.” (He doesn’t think so.) In the unlikely — but politically fascinating — event that a Cabinet were to use the power to oust a sitting president, what would come next?
Let’s take a deeper look at the 25th Amendment and think about what each section of it has meant in the past — and what it might mean for Trump-era politics.
Section 1. In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.
The amendment’s initial section revisits what Article II of the Constitution set up from the beginning — the vice president takes over if the president dies or is unable to serve — but with clearer language to clean up previous constitutional confusion. When William Henry Harrison died shortly after his inauguration in 1841, there were questions about whether John Tyler, nicknamed “His Accidency,” was truly the president or just an “acting” president of some kind. Tyler made clear his intent to fully occupy the office and do everything an elected president would have done — and he forged his own path separate from Harrison. Since then, seven presidents have taken office after a presidential death (all before the 25th Amendment was ratified) and one after a resignation. In this way, the amendment codified the status quo.1
What this means now: Many have already discussed the possibility of a President Pence. But it’s worth underscoring how much he represents a different, more establishment brand of Republicanism than Trump. If Trump were to be removed for incapacity, it would be an interesting test of whether Trumpism could survive if carried out by a leader with a very different temperament and political profile — or if that leader would abandon Trumpism altogether.
Section 2. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.
Before this, if the vice president became president, there was … no vice president. That exact situation accounted for 24 years of U.S. history, including a period just before Congress took up the 25th Amendment in 1965. From taking the oath of office in November 1963 until he and Hubert Humphrey were sworn in after winning election in 1964, Lyndon Johnson had no vice president. Instead, the next two people in line (per the 1947 Presidential Succession Act) were both in poor health and, in the words of Roll Call’s David Hawkings, “a combined 157 years old.” This section of the 25th Amendment has since been invoked twice, when Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973 and Richard Nixon chose Gerald Ford to replace him, and when Ford succeeded Nixon as president in 1974 and chose Nelson Rockefeller as his VP.
What this means now: If Pence became president, he could choose his own veep, subject to congressional approval. Depending on party control of Congress, that could get interesting. It would offer a chance for Pence to either choose a Trump ally or move the party in a different direction. Pence’s choice could say a lot about whether invoking the amendment was a reaction to Trump personally or a repudiation of his overall approach to politics.
Section 3. Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.
This section seems like it should be pretty straightforward. It was invoked without controversy twice in the early 2000s when President George W. Bush signed over power to Vice President Dick Cheney for a few hours during sedation for routine medical procedures. But it can get fuzzy.
The 25th Amendment wasn’t invoked when Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981, despite the fact that the White House physician kept a copy of the amendment in his bag. Bill Clinton didn’t formally put Section 3 provisions in place when he had knee surgery in 1997, saying that he was never under general anesthesia. However, Clinton’s press secretary indicated that the chief of staff had been in close contact with Vice President Al Gore’s staff in case “anything about the 25th Amendment is indicated.”
And there is disagreement on whether Reagan properly invoked the 25th Amendment in 1985 when he underwent surgery to remove a polyp from his colon. Reagan submitted letters to the House speaker and Senate president pro tempore designating Vice President George H.W. Bush as acting president, citing an “existing agreement” between the two. The letters also stated that Reagan was not specifically activating the process laid out in the 25th Amendment and that he did not believe that “the drafters of this Amendment intended its application to situations such as the instant one.”
Some argue that this message reflected the basic spirit of the 25th Amendment, while others suggest that because it wasn’t a formal invocation, it’s not really an instance of a president using the 25th Amendment.
What this means now: When people talk today about invoking the 25th Amendment, they aren’t talking about Trump having minor surgery and temporarily handing the reins to Pence. But the resistance of earlier presidents to using the 25th Amendment in such cases, even though the amendment seems directly designed for those instances, illustrates the depth of the struggle and complications over control of presidential power.
Section 4 (first paragraph). Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President. 
Here’s where we transition from historical explanation to future speculation. This section has never been invoked, and it has a number of ambiguous phrases that leave it open to a range of possibilities. For starters, who exactly gets to decide that the president isn’t able to serve? The conventional interpretation of the amendment is that it needs the vice president plus a majority of the Cabinet.2
But with the deciders well agreed upon, if not explicitly spelled out, what does “unable to discharge powers and duties of the office” mean, and who gets to provide the definition? The context for the 25th Amendment was pretty clearly aimed at the kind of physical and mental incapacities that come after strokes, heart attacks and bullets. Woodrow Wilson’s stroke, Dwight Eisenhower’s heart attack and John F. Kennedy’s assassination (and the related worry about what would have happened if he had survived but been incapacitated) all informed the debate about the amendment. But there’s nothing in the text that actually requires a diagnosis.
What this means now: This could end up being a test of the authority of the Cabinet as much as anything else. The amendment empowers the Cabinet to take this action. But what we see with Section 3 is that a lot of anxiety about giving up power still looms over the process. Even if the Cabinet followed the letter of the law, it might still look like a palace coup. In order to get around this, the Cabinet has to have a certain amount of stature — an issue that would be put to the test if it sought to remove the commander in chief.
Section 4 (second paragraph). Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session.
In other words, the 25th Amendment provides a way for the president to respond to accusations of a lack of fitness. And that’s where things get interesting. After the president offers a declaration that he or she is able to serve, the Cabinet has four days to object and respond. But who gets to be president during that time? The text isn’t clear. It goes on to say:
If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.
Many parts of the Constitution are vague, but this one sets the country up for a pretty wild ride. Constitutional scholar Brian Kalt points out: “Section 4 is drafted less than perfectly. The best reading of Section 4’s text — and the clear message from its drafting history — is that when the president declares he is able, he does not retake power until either (1) four days pass without the vice-president and Cabinet disagreeing; or (2) he, the president, wins the vote in Congress. But the text is ambiguous on this point and commentators have frequently misread it as allowing the president to retake power immediately upon his declaration of ability.”
This opens up a possibility that Kalt describes in detail in his book “Constitutional Cliffhangers,” in which the country ends up with two presidents and two Cabinets. In the fictional scenario, the vice president and 11 Cabinet members agree to remove a president whose behavior has been erratic. But she conspires with her chief of staff to “declare that no inability exists,” reclaims power, and fires and replaces the Cabinet that removed her. In this setup, an amendment aimed at preventing a constitutional crises has now created one.
Kalt and others have pointed out that, in addition to the ambiguity of the text, it is difficult to remove a president through the 25th Amendment. In the event that the president disagrees about the incapacity issue, the amendment requires two-thirds of the House and Senate to remove him or her (as opposed to the impeachment process, which requires a simple majority of the House to impeach and two-thirds of the Senate to convict).
What this means now: The provision of the amendment that everyone’s been talking about is the one we know the least about. Since the 25th Amendment was ratified, presidents, vice presidents and White House officials have tread very cautiously around the provisions of Section 4. It seems fairly safe to say that there are lingering legitimacy issues when it comes to members of the executive branch actually talking about removing the president and replacing him or her with the vice president. And even under perfectly innocuous circumstances, presidents seem very reluctant to entertain the idea of being temporarily replaced under the amendment’s provisions.
All of this points to a conclusion we probably already knew: The Cabinet, especially as it’s currently constituted, is pretty unlikely to take action against Trump. But Congress has its own set of political pressures, and if the Democratic “wave” happens, we may see a serious attempt to go after the president. If impeachment proceedings don’t get off the ground, Congress could turn to the 25th Amendment: While Congress can’t initiate removal of the president under the amendment, it can convene a body to investigate the president’s fitness to serve — and such legislation has already been proposed.
Convening an investigative commission might seem like a bureaucratic and indirect step compared with the drama of impeachment. But such a commission might be easier to sell to members of Congress who are wary of impeachment. It might also be a way to address the legitimacy issues that otherwise seem to plague the 25th Amendment — a president’s removal from office may be less likely to be seen as a coup if it comes from the people’s elected representatives. And voting to create a commission might be more palatable for congressional Republicans.
One of the arguments against invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump is that it wasn’t really intended for this purpose. But looking at how the amendment has been used in practice reveals that political context matters, and so does legitimacy. Presidents have avoided activating Section 3 of the article, appearing reluctant to concede even temporary power to their own vice presidents. And Section 4 spells out a process that is legally unclear. It’s likely that any discussion of the 25th Amendment will be about the politics of the moment rather than the precise text of its provisions. Whether we see it put into practice will depend on whether Congress or members of the Cabinet see political benefit in doing so. A critical part of that process would be to overcome the legitimacy challenges and political disruption that using the 25th Amendment would create.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

84 percent increase
According to Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, the number of fires in the country’s Amazon rainforest this year has increased 84 percent from the same time a year before. The agency said it detected more than 74,000 fires between January and August, the most since the data began in 2013. Conservationists place blame at the feet of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro who, they say, “has encouraged loggers and farmers to clear the land.” [BBC]
$1 trillion
The U.S. federal deficit is forecasted to reach $1 trillion for the 2020 fiscal year, according to new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. That debt has been increasing following a $1.5 trillion tax cut and a budget deal that increases government spending by hundreds of billions of dollars. “The nation’s fiscal outlook is challenging,” the director of the CBO said. [CNN]
11,000 birds
Earlier this month, some 11,000 birds — waterfowl and wetlands birds — were killed or maimed during a hailstorm near Billings, Montana. That’s about a quarter of the birds in the Big Lake Wildlife Management Area, according to a biologist’s estimate. The storm brought “an unusual August episode of three-inch hail and winds gusting up to 74 mph.” [The Washington Post]
800 contestants
More than 800 contestants assembled in Kyoto this month for an abacus (or soroban, in Japanese) competition. Some 43,000 Japanese students take advances lessons in the centuries-old calculating device, according to government estimates. One winner at the competition broke his own Guinness World Record by adding — in his head, imagining an abacus’s beads — 15 three-digit numbers in 1.64 seconds. [The New York Times]
4-0 vote
By a unanimous 4-0 vote, the commissioners of rural Lincoln County, Nevada, declared a state of emergency. The looming threat? A joke Facebook event called “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us,” to which more than 2 million people have RSVPed, some of whom might actually show up in the desert, hoping to raid the military site in the hopes of finding extraterrestrial life. “We have no pickin’ idea what we’re going to face — if anything,” said one commissioner. [USA Today]
4 hitters, 40 homers
Four hitters — Pete Alonso, Mike Trout, Christian Yelich and Cody Bellinger — have already joined the 40-home-run club this season, and their teams have only played 125 games. It’s the first time that’s happened since the juicy days of 2001 when Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Luis Gonzalez and Jim Thome did it. “Total home runs are on pace to shatter the MLB record this season, and three of the top four seasons by total home runs have come in the past four years,” my colleague Travis Sawchik writes.

$16.3 trillion plan
Bernie Sanders, Democratic presidential candidate, has unveiled a $16.3 trillion plan to combat climate change — “the latest and most expensive proposal from the field.” He also dubs his plan the Green New Deal, and it calls for the U.S. to end its use of fossil fuels by 2050 and create new solar, wind and geothermal energy sources; declares climate change a national emergency; and promises $200 billion to poor countries to deal with climate change. [The New York Times]
3rd candidate
Speaking of climate change, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who made the climate the centerpiece of his campaign, has dropped out of the presidential race. This news comes after the announcement that he did not make the cut for participating in a CNN town hall devoted to the climate crisis. [NBC News]
210 YouTube channels
Following similar moves by Twitter and Facebook, Google has disabled 210 YouTube channels that the company found to be spreading misinformation about the pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. Google said the channels used methods to hide their origins, but it “stopped short of explicitly blaming the Chinese government for the misleading accounts.” [CNBC]
14 years
A manned expedition dove to the site of the sunken Titanic this month for the first time in 14 years. Thanks to “crumbling from salt corrosion, metal-eating bacteria and deep ocean currents,” the explorers found “shocking” areas of deterioration. The captain’s bath tub, for example, has entirely disappeared. [ABC News]
2 people
In a “landmark decision,” a Mexican court has approved the recreational use of cocaine for two unidentified people. They may possess, transport and use the drug, but not buy it or sell it. The decision won’t take effect until approved by a higher court, but some advocacy groups see it as a step to end the country’s “violent” and “unsustainable” drug war. [USA Today]

Sean Spicer, the former White House Press Secretary, will compete next month on the reality show “Dancing With the Stars.” Spicer — not, um, surprisingly — is the longest shot to win, according to the bookmaker Sportsbetting.ag. He’ll take to the dance floor at odd of 50-to-1. [Roll Call]

Poll(s) of the week 
We’ve had a flurry of new polls about the 2020 presidential race released over the last week. The results confirm some broad dynamics that have been clear for months. President Trump’s poor job approval ratings make him vulnerable to defeat next year. Former Vice President Joe Biden leads the Democratic primary field, largely because of support from voters who are black, over the age of 50, more moderate and/or without college degrees. Democratic voters like many of the 2020 candidates but are particularly obsessed with “electability,” and many think Biden is the most likely candidate to defeat Trump.
But some of the other findings from these surveys1 were more surprising, so for this edition of Pollapalooza, let’s just run through a few of the numbers that stood out.
Hispanic Democrats don’t seem to have a favorite yet.
A lot of polls of the 2020 race don’t include a large enough number of Latino respondents to break out the group’s results. But in its newly released survey, the Pew Research Center interviewed 237 Hispanic respondents who either identify as Democrats or lean towards the party. Biden had the support of 27 percent of Latino Democrats, with Bernie Sanders (15 percent) and Elizabeth Warren (14) the only other candidates in double-digits. Morning Consult found fairly different results among Hispanic voters: Sanders at 29 percent, Biden 22 and Warren 10.
In short, exactly where Hispanic voters stand is somewhat unclear. While basically every poll shows Biden well ahead among blacks, Hispanic voters as a bloc seem more up for grabs.
Perhaps Hispanic voters won’t unify behind a single candidate — unlike black Democrats, they haven’t historically. But if they do, or even if they partially do, that could substantially alter the race — Hispanic adults represent about 12 percent of registered Democrats and will likely be particularly pivotal in Nevada, which votes third in the 2020 primary process, and in California and Texas, which both vote on Super Tuesday.
And Hispanic voters could be especially important to Warren, whose support comes predominantly from white Democrats. If Warren struggles to get traction with black and Hispanic Democrats, that complicates her path to the nomination — both in terms of raw votes and perceptions. White liberal Democrats are increasingly conscious of race, and I suspect that they will be hesitant to coalesce around Warren if her coalition is almost exclusively white. But the Pew poll, for example, found Warren doing better among Hispanic than black respondents (though she still did best among whites), so Hispanic voters represent both a challenge for Warren and an opportunity to diversify her coalition.
There’s a gender gap — but not between male and female voters.
Biden does about equally well among men and women. In fact, the leading Democratic candidates — Biden, Sanders, Warren and Kamala Harris — all have coalitions that are roughly balanced in terms of gender, according to Pew. So there’s not really a gender gap among Democratic primary voters — at least so far.
But the gender of the candidates appears to be more of a factor. Polling suggests Harris and Warren are appealing to the same kinds of voters: people with college degrees — both men and women. A disproportionate share of both Harris and Warren’s support comes from college graduates, per the Pew data. In short, maybe college graduates, more so than women, are open to or excited about a female presidential candidate — or at least Harris and Warren in particular. Or conversely, non-college voters — both men and women — have so far been less likely to support the top-tier women running.
Cory Booker and Beto O’Rourke are still way behind.
The New Jersey senator had what was widely considered a strong performance in the second Democratic debate. The recent mass shooting in El Paso, O’Rourke’s hometown, not only increased media attention around the ex-congressman, but seemed to spur him towards a more aggressive campaign focused on combating racism and taking on Trump. But neither man showed any real gains in recent surveys from CNN and Morning Consult; both are still stuck in the low single digits.
Again, please don’t pay much attention to general election polls. 
OK, this is more of a public service announcement than a surprising finding from a recent poll. But the last week or so has seemed to bring a flurry of attention to general election survey results. We don’t mean to be dismissive of other news organizations or pollsters. But as we’ve noted before, general election polls this far out are not particularly predictive. And polls that ask people if they would vote for Trump versus an unnamed Democratic candidate are even less useful. A real-life candidate — Biden or Warren or anyone else — has specific advantages and flaws that a generic Democrat does not.
So Democrats should not take comfort in the new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in which 52 percent of Americans said either they would or were likely to vote for a generic Democratic candidate in 2020, while only 40 percent said they either would or were likely to vote for Trump. Similarly, Republicans shouldn’t take comfort in the new Crooked Media/Change Research poll that found Trump at 45 percent in Wisconsin, compared to 46 percent for an unnamed Democrat. (A nearly tied race in Wisconsin would suggest a super close race nationally.)
Other polling bites 
The majority of Americans (50 percent) think that colleges and universities are having a positive effect on the country. But there is a big partisan divide on this question, according to a new Pew Research Center survey: 67 percent of Democrats said colleges and universities are having a positive impact; among Republicans, only 33 percent agree.
46 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, while 51 percent disapprove, according to a new AP-NORC poll. His approval numbers are lower on other issues, including gun policy (36 percent approve, 61 disapprove), health care (37-60), immigration (38-60) and foreign policy (36-61).
66 percent of Democratic voters think Biden would probably defeat Trump in the general election, according to an Economist/YouGov survey released this week, the highest mark for any Democratic candidate. A majority of Democrats also think that Sanders (60 percent) and Warren (58 percent) would be likely to win a general election.
According to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Americans have fairly favorable views — 52 percent positive, 27 percent negative — of Planned Parenthood. They have less positive views of the National Rifle Association (40 percent positive, 41 percent negative), Warren (31-32), Sanders (37-40), Biden (34-38) and Trump (39-53).
63 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults said they are excited about several of the 2020 candidates, compared to 35 percent who said they are excited about their first choice candidate only, according to Pew.
Trump has a 95 percent to 2 percent lead over former South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford among likely GOP primary voters in the Palmetto State, according to a recent poll conducted by the Post and Courier and Change Research. Sanford is considering a primary challenge to Trump.
Warren leads among likely Democratic primary voters in Wisconsin with 29 percent of the vote, according to the Crooked/Change Research poll. Sanders, with 24 percent, and Biden, at 20 percent, are the only other candidates in double digits.
78 percent of Americans think that the way information is spread on social media served as a contributing factor in the recent mass shootings in Ohio and Texas, according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey. Other contributing factors included a lack of effective treatment of mental illness (75 percent), media coverage of mass shootings (72 percent), Trump’s rhetoric (54 percent), and assault-style weapons (60 percent).
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 41.5 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 54 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -12.5 points). At this time last week, 42.2 percent approved and 53.4 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -11.2 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 42.7 percent and a disapproval rating of 53.0 percent, for a net approval rating of -10.3 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.3 percentage points (46.2 percent to 39.9 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 6.2 points (46.1 percent to 39.9 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.4 points (46.2 percent to 39.8 percent).

The state won 11 national titles from 1983 to 2013. The history of college football cannot be written without the Florida Gators, Florida State Seminoles and Miami Hurricanes, without coaches like Steve Spurrier, Bobby Bowden and Dennis Erickson or players like Emmitt Smith, Deion Sanders and Sean Taylor. But as college football’s sesquicentennial gets under way this weekend with a prime-time matchup between No. 8 Florida and Miami, Florida’s trio of powerhouses is mired in its worst stretch of football since the schools broke onto the scene in the 1980s.
“Things can change quickly in football, in both directions, as we’ve seen,” new Miami head coach Manny Diaz said during his introductory press conference.
Much has changed in the Sunshine State since injured New York Mets minor leaguer Tim Tebow led Florida to one national title and played as a backup for another in just three seasons, since Florida State became the first program to go 14 consecutive seasons with 10 or more wins and since Miami fielded rosters featuring future Pro Bowlers playing second- and third-string. With Alabama and Clemson perennially squaring off for national titles, and the gulf constantly widening between the sport’s elites and everyone else, the state of Florida has been on the outside looking in over the past few years.
For one thing, Florida’s non-Power Five programs have elevated their status. Scott Frost turned winless Central Florida into an undefeated juggernaut self-recognized as a national champion after the 2017 season, then Josh Heupel guided the Knights to a 12-1 record in his first year at the helm. With Lane Kiffin running the show, Florida Atlantic has gone 16-10 over the past two seasons. South Florida was relevant before Charlie Strong arrived, but the Bulls have finished each of his seasons with a winning record.
But the breadwinners have also fallen by the wayside. Miami was never a stay-for-long locale for coaches and was frequently used as a launching pad — Howard Schnellenberger, Jimmy Johnson, Butch Davis — to vault into the professional ranks. But the Hurricanes have hired four head coaches since 2006 after having just three run the show from 1979 to 1994. Florida, meanwhile, has hired three head coaches since Urban Meyer left in 2010. Coaching turnover, then, mirrors what the win-loss totals suggest: lackluster performance. Florida’s holy triumvirate went a combined 22-16 in 2018, with the Seminoles missing bowl season for the first time in 36 years. According to Sports-Reference.com’s Simple Rating System, Florida State was 1.67 points worse than average a season ago — the first instance of one of the three teams being worse than average since 2007 and just the second since 1997.
To quantify the state’s downturn, we sought out the help of FiveThirtyEight’s Elo ratings, which measure the strength of each program over time. In an effort to avoid outliers skewing the data, we took the harmonic mean of the season-ending Elo of Florida’s Big 3 by year. Since the 1980 season, the eight worst marks have come in the past 12 years. Last season’s harmonic mean of 1689 was the fourth-worst mark, although it was an improvement over 2017, which was the third-worst.
Traditionally, success hasn’t been much of a problem for these programs that can recruit locally from the football-rich state. Football factories like IMG Academy in Bradenton and St. Thomas Aquinas in Fort Lauderdale are churning out blue-chip talent each year. But as competition for recruits has thickened, the preeminent powers have fallen from the highest tier.
Perhaps that changes this season. But as Bowden put it, “I know one thing: It’s easier to get to the top than it is to stay there.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-seth-moultons-campaign-failed/,2019-08-23,,,features,"Aug. 23, 2019",Why Seth Moulton’s Campaign Failed,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Some people run for president to raise their national profile. In Rep. Seth Moulton’s case, his campaign didn’t even do that. Only 28 percent of Democrats could form an opinion of Moulton in an average of polls conducted between Aug. 1 and 20. This was lower name recognition than any of the other major presidential candidates in that time period and was a big part of the reason why Moulton never reached 2 percent in any poll — let alone one that counted toward debate qualification.
Moulton found himself stuck in a vicious cycle: Without higher polling numbers, he couldn’t qualify for the primary debates … and without being in the debates, he lacked a platform from which to improve his polling numbers. So on Friday, the Massachusetts congressman dropped out of the Democratic primary for president in a speech to the Democratic National Committee. He is the fifth candidate to drop out this summer and the third in just the past nine days. His departure leaves us with 20 major Democratic candidates for president, by FiveThirtyEight’s definition.
A Marine veteran who served four tours in Iraq, Moulton focused his campaign on national security and veterans’ issues; the most memorable moment of his campaign was probably his poignant admission that he had sought treatment for post-traumatic stress. But polls showed that foreign policy is not a top priority for voters (and hasn’t been for the past several cycles), and our research last year suggested that candidates who are veterans don’t win Democratic primaries at higher rates.
Moulton’s path was also blocked by higher-profile candidates who appealed to the same constituencies. If voters were looking for a Harvard-educated veteran around 40 years of age, they already had South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose polling surge came just before Moulton entered the race. Indeed, Moulton admitted to The New York Times that he had made a mistake with his late announcement date, which gave him just seven weeks to collect the necessary polls or donors to qualify for the first debate. And if voters were looking for someone “electable” or who didn’t hail from the progressive wing of the party, there was former Vice President Joe Biden, who has dominated polls among those whose first priority is defeating President Trump and among moderate and conservative Democrats. Moulton praised Biden upon his exit from the race, although he stopped short of a formal endorsement: “I think it’s evident that this is now a three-way race between Biden, [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren and [Sen. Bernie] Sanders, and really it’s a debate about how far left the party should go,” he told the Times. “I’m not going to endorse anyone right away, but the vice president is a mentor and a friend and I think he’d make a great president.”
Other than financial difficulties (he reportedly had to lay off many of his staffers earlier this month), one other factor may explain why Moulton dropped out so early: The clock was ticking on his decision to run for another office. In this respect, Moulton fits into a clear pattern of those who have dropped out of the race so far. Rep. Eric Swalwell and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee would have encountered legal issues if they tried to run for president and for reelection at the same time, and when their presidential campaigns failed to catch fire, they took the safer route and chose to hold onto their day jobs. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, meanwhile, faced intense pressure to run for a Republican-held Senate seat, which he finally decided to do this week. And while Moulton could have legally run for president and the House at the same time, he is already facing a couple of primary challenges in the Massachusetts 6th District, and the longer his attention was elsewhere, the more vulnerable he probably would have been back home. Moulton confirmed on Friday that he would seek reelection, trading one contested primary for another — though his chances of winning the new one are much higher.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/transfer-quarterbacks-are-all-the-rage-but-do-they-deliver-at-their-new-schools/,2019-08-22,,,features,"Aug. 22, 2019","Transfer Quarterbacks Are All The Rage, But Do They Deliver At Their New Schools?",Jake Lourim,FiveThirtyEight,College Football,"You don’t have to look hard at college football these days to find somebody, somewhere, talking about transfers. More players are switching teams each year, and more are seeking waivers that grant immediate eligibility at their new school — and it seems like just about everybody in the sport has an opinion about it.
“The issue with the transfer portal is we’ve gotten very liberal in giving people waivers, so, when we do that, it becomes free agency,” Alabama coach Nick Saban said last month. Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, too, has cautioned against “free agency in college football.”
But even calling it “free agency” is understating the flurry of moves. Of the top 25 teams in the preseason coaches’ poll, as many as eight could start a transfer at quarterback later this month. Five of those eight quarterbacks1 were not active for their current team last season. For comparison, in the NFL — which, of course, has literal free agency — only about four of 32 starters weren’t on their current team last season.2
In the last decade, transferring in college football has increased in frequency. Some of this is due to changes in NCAA guidelines and the establishment of a transfer portal that facilitates contact between players and coaches. The NCAA’s evolving stance on immediate-eligibility waivers — which allowed Michigan’s Shea Patterson to play last season after transferring from Ole Miss, and Justin Fields to suit up for Ohio State this season — has expedited the transfer movement.
The optimal approach is to find an elite talent and develop him, as Clemson has done with Trevor Lawrence and Alabama with Tua Tagovailoa. But those who miss out on that chance sometimes turn to the next-best option — and it often works. Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley, entering his fifth year with the program, has coached the last two Heisman Trophy winners. Both were transfers, Baker Mayfield from Texas Tech and Kyler Murray from Texas A&M. It’s no longer only bench players who move schools in search of more playing time; athletes of all levels and abilities are taking advantage of their newfound mobility to develop their careers.
The impact of this wave of transfers is evident at both the college and professional level. Alabama and Georgia produced the current starting quarterbacks for four of the top five teams: the Crimson Tide’s Tagovailoa, the Bulldogs’ Jake Fromm, Oklahoma’s Jalen Hurts and Ohio State’s Fields. Five of the 11 quarterbacks taken in the 2019 NFL draft were transfers.3
The college football programs themselves have also incentivized player movement. Teams’ increasing reliance on younger quarterbacks chases away the rest of the depth chart: If a freshman has a firm hold on the starting job, there’s no playing time available for three years, barring an injury. Lawrence’s emergence at Clemson in 2018, for example, sparked two departures — Kelly Bryant to Missouri and Hunter Johnson to Northwestern — while Georgia’s Fromm pushed out two more, Fields to Ohio State and Jacob Eason to Washington.
The search for playing time creates a ripple effect: Soon after Fields showed up at Ohio State, quarterback Tate Martell, previously expected to start in 2019, transferred to Miami. After Hurts arrived at Oklahoma, Sooners quarterback Austin Kendall left for West Virginia.
It’s not just at the highest level of the sport. In addition to the eight top 25 teams, Mississippi State (Tommy Stevens, formerly of Penn State), Virginia Tech (Ryan Willis, previously at Kansas) and Missouri (Bryant) are among the power-conference schools who have settled on or considered starting transfer quarterbacks.
But what gets lost in the drama of the quarterback carousel is that these transfers are rarely a magic solution. Yes, Mayfield and Murray were the two most successful transfer quarterbacks this century, based on passer ratings.4 But schools turning to a transfer to transform their program often end up disappointed.
Since 2000, 94 players have attempted at least 50 passes in a season for two different schools. Here we see the trend over time: five quarterbacks joined a new team between 2000 and 2004, while 13 transferred schools between 2005 and 2009. Twenty-eight quarterbacks transferred between 2010 and 2014, and 48 of those 94 have departed for greener pastures since 2015.
Of that group, 58 transferred to a Power 5 school. (This includes both quarterbacks who transferred from non-Power 5 schools as well as quarterbacks who transferred between Power 5 schools.) Nineteen Power 5 transfers improved their passer rating from their first stop to their second by at least 15 points, an impressive rise. But 12 more saw their passer rating drop by at least 15 points.5 The average change in passer rating is plus-4.9, and the average bump in completion percentage is 2 points, both modest upticks. However it may seem, it’s just not that easy to move towns, learn a new offense, adjust to new teammates and coaches and blossom into a completely different player.

Beyond sheer volume, this year’s group of transfer quarterbacks is especially fascinating because it might also be the most talented bunch the sport has seen. Jalen Hurts’s father was not far off when he speculated after the 2017 season that Hurts could be the “biggest free agent in college football history.” The quarterbacks potentially debuting in new uniforms next weekend include a national champion in Hurts and three former five-star recruits (Fields, Washington’s Eason and Northwestern’s Johnson). This could have a major effect. Oklahoma does not need Hurts to do much more than his numbers would already indicate. Even an average 4.9-point bump in passer rating from his career 148.8 would put him among last season’s 20 most efficient quarterbacks in the major conferences.
No matter what becomes of this year’s crop of transfers, schools will surely keep swapping quarterbacks in the future. Transfers can be good for the coaches, who find a one- or two-year solution to their quarterback vacancies. After two of his quarterbacks transferred, Arkansas coach Chad Morris replaced them this past offseason with graduate transfers Ben Hicks, originally at Southern Methodist, and Nick Starkel, from Texas A&M. “As I’ve shared all along, we are always in the quarterback market. It doesn’t matter — we are always in that market,” he said last winter. And it appears quarterback reps are going to remain scarce at Clemson, for example, with Heisman co-favorite Lawrence only a sophomore.
Still, high expectations will follow a transfer anywhere. It would be hard to ask Hurts to replicate the Heisman-winning seasons of Mayfield or Murray. Expecting Fields, a sophomore with 39 career passing attempts, to equal what NFL first-round draft pick Dwayne Haskins did last season is also a stretch.
But that doesn’t mean those teams won’t try. “If Jalen does win the starting job from everything I’ve seen, I’m not sure there’s anything we’ve done before I wouldn’t do with him,” Oklahoma’s Riley said in a radio interview last month. Defenses should buckle up. The twists and turns are just getting started.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

In an increasingly polarized political climate, adherence to party or ideological orthodoxy seems de rigueur. Social media serves only to amplify that perception at times. 
But Americans’ political views are often idiosyncratic and sometimes offensive, and they rarely adhere neatly to any particular party line. In this column, we want to dig into Americans’ messy opinions on politics, morality and social mores. We hope that this exercise gives readers a glimpse into the minds of those with whom they might disagree — or agree! If you have a political belief that you’re willing to share with us, fill out this form — we might get in touch.
This week we talked to Owen, a 37-year-old white man in California. He wrote that he is “open to mass surveillance if it can lead to a world where a much higher percent of crimes are caught, leading to better public safety and, ideally, shorter [or] lighter sentences (because you don’t need as big a threat of punishment to deter people from crimes if the likelihood of catching them is very high).”
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Clare Malone: How did you come to this position?
Owen: I first started thinking about this after I heard a Radiolab episode that was about a period where, I think, Mexican cities were monitored by overhead drones that were taking a picture of the entire city maybe every 30 seconds. If a murder was committed, they could then go backwards in time and could say, “OK, here’s when we think the murder happened, here’s a car that showed up just before, here’s where that car went, here’s some other cars that recently committed some crimes and look, they all ended up in the same place. It looks like we found a gang.” And they were actually able to bust significant gangs through the ability to have a picture of the entire city every 30 seconds.
It just made the benefits of that type of surveillance very tangible, and it got me thinking, “Well, the benefits there are so obviously good, and if we could just get a lot of the stuff around law enforcement right — which is obviously an ‘if’ — then the public benefits are so large.”
It brings up all these other questions around racial justice [and] law enforcement: Are we actually policing the crimes we want to police? Is there still this rich-poor divide where rich, mostly white people get away with stuff and people of color do not? Those are all still open questions, but the idea that we would give up on this potential just because surveillance is icky … seems like there’s some baby being thrown out with the bathwater there.
All that said, in the wrong hands, surveillance is the tool of the oppressor. If you look at what’s going on in China, it’s super scary, and it’s enough to make me think, OK, maybe I should be backing off here, not dabbling in these waters.
CM: I want to drill down into what kind of mass surveillance you’re thinking of. Are you thinking about a London-style system where you have video cameras everywhere? Should authorities be able to access your phone? How far do you think it should be able to go? 
Owen: What we think of as public space, I think it’s OK if we have our eye on because in many public streets, we have security cameras in one place or another.
CM: What if your workplace, without you realizing it, has cameras? 
Owen: That’s getting into the middle of the gradient where I’m not exactly sure. I think the workplace is maybe more public than private. I think I’m maybe more OK with visual surveillance than audio surveillance. People should be able to say what they want without thinking, “The government is going to get me,” unless I’m talking seriously about committing violence. And then, how do you know I’m talking seriously about committing violence?
When it gets into private communications, I think maybe those should be totally private, but then you’re allowing people to conspire.
CM: So you lean toward: “People’s private communications stay private?” 
Owen: Yes.
CM: What about the creepiness quotient? How do you answer to that? 
Owen: The creepiness factor is real. I think a lot of it comes down to: “Do you trust the creeper? Do you trust the person at the other end of the camera?” Government surveillance, when you don’t trust the government, is uncomfortable.
CM: Do you trust the government? 
Owen: I am a comfortably middle-class white person and I haven’t had many interactions where I’m like, “Uh oh, this policeman might fuck me up right now,” whereas I have black friends where that’s something they have to think about all the time.
CM: You mentioned before that there were racial and social justice issues that come up. A lot of what you’re talking about sounds like broken windows policing to me. How would you answer to that?
Owen: And that’s crossed my mind, and it makes me super uncomfortable. Who ends up getting policed when you do stuff like this? I like to think of it as something completely neutral, almost an algorithmic system where the robot watches all and just identifies crime, whoever’s doing it. But we’ve seen all these examples where someone creates an AI [artificial intelligence system], and depending on what you expose the AI to, the AI becomes racist.
CM: Do you feel unsafe in your neighborhood or city?
Owen: That’s not where it started, honestly. I generally feel pretty safe. Now I have a kid and another on the way. I think a little more about, “Is my kid going to be safe?” But I generally don’t walk around too worried about it. But it feels like the potential is there to largely do away with gangs. There are some parts of the country where that’s a serious issue.
CM: Have you talked to anyone about this? 
Owen: Most of my friends are liberal. I think the general reaction is, “No, you can’t do that. The government surveilling everyone is clearly a bad idea.” I mentioned it to a black friend of mine and he said, “Yeah, you do that, and the camera is going to be over the black neighborhood, and it’s going to be the thing that makes it way easier to police black people for random shit.”
CM: Do you remember how you felt about the Edward Snowden revelations of mass surveillance a few years ago? 
Owen: I was totally pro-Snowden. It didn’t feel like the government was really making the case for what it was doing. I think if you want to mass surveil, it should be a totally open thing, where you’re talking about what you’re surveilling and why, and what the benefits are.
CM: Do you think your notion of privacy has changed at all in the last few years?
Owen: Sure. Because it isn’t a core issue for me, it’s more wet clay than most issues are in my mind. You could show me a study that said: “The state tried surveillance, and it was a total nightmare, and they locked everyone up.” That might sway me back the other way — this tool is too powerful for any government, and let’s just lean hard in the privacy direction and hope for the best.
And before, you asked me if I trust the government, and I certainly don’t trust this administration, and I don’t trust the American electorate to constantly produce politicians that I do trust. What I do trust is a good system of checks and balances and incentives; that part is very important, too. If you don’t have the ability to audit the surveilers, you’re asking people to trust the government en masse, but also then you’re saying everyone who enters the government has to achieve that level of trust, which is crazy.
CM: You’re saying you don’t trust this administration — would you trust a Democratic administration more? Because the Snowden revelations occurred during the Obama administration. 
Owen: I would trust a Democratic administration more. But I actually think this might work better as a municipal thing. Your legislators are your neighbors, to a degree. There’s more accountability.
There’s this little mini-movement of progressive prosecutors — and that’s mostly happening at the city level — and it feels like the things they can get done at the city level are more difficult to get done on the state or federal level.
And a bit of a side note, but the progressive prosecutor movement seemed to be buoyed by all the Black Lives Matter stuff. A major part of that was [that] all the violence against people of color by the police is now being recorded because everyone has a phone on them. And you get all these horrifying videos that are impossible to ignore. Statistics — you can brush off and move on with your day. But if you see the Eric Garner video — what if there was no Eric Garner video? I feel like the ability to see some of this stuff has pushed us in a more social justice-y direction, in a really good way.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democratic-voters-care-about-climate-change-but-not-enough-to-support-jay-inslee/,2019-08-22,,,features,"Aug. 22, 2019","Democratic Voters Care About Climate Change, But Not Enough To Support Jay Inslee",Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Washington Gov. Jay Inslee got into the presidential race because climate change is the “most urgent challenge of our time.” And although he announced on Wednesday that he was dropping out (he plans to seek a third term as governor instead), Inslee did bring more attention to his key issue — CNN is now scheduled to hold a town hall where 10 Democratic candidates will discuss the “climate crisis” in early September, for example. But that wasn’t enough to convince voters Inslee was the right choice.
Part of Inslee’s problem was that he struggled to improve his standing in the polls since he first declared he was running in March. Inslee qualified for the first two debates and even cleared one of the two hurdles for making the third debate — he hit the Democratic National Committee’s 130,000-donor threshold, but he never cracked 2 percent in a qualifying poll. That meant he wouldn’t get invited to the third debate or even to CNN’s town hall on climate change, as they used the same polling thresholds the DNC set for the third debate — 2 percent in at least four qualifying polls — to limit participation.
Nonetheless, the very existence of a climate-centered forum signals that Inslee’s campaign was at least somewhat successful. Yes, the DNC refused to focus one of the primary debates entirely on climate change, but there has still been a broader push among Democrats to address the issue head-on. For instance, most of the Democratic presidential field has either co-sponsored or endorsed the “Green New Deal,” a sweeping resolution that House Democrats introduced earlier this year that demands the government tackle climate change with ambitious actions like net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, all the candidates want to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, and nearly all want the U.S. to strengthen its commitment to lowering emissions. And it’s not just the candidates — Democratic voters say climate change is a top issue for them and one they want to hear about in the debates. But in the end, focusing on climate change wasn’t enough for Inslee to break out.
Now Inslee will return home to focus on his reelection bid. Washington doesn’t have term limits for governors, and if Inslee does win next November, he will be only the second governor in Washington’s history to win three consecutive terms in office (Republican Dan Evans is the only governor to have done this before, serving from 1965 to 1977). And as things currently stand, Inslee has a good chance of pulling it off.
First of all, Inslee is relatively popular at home — according to Morning Consult’s quarterly job approval ratings for governors, 47 percent approved of his job performance compared to 35 percent who disapproved, giving him a net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating) of +12. Inslee also isn’t expected to face a notable primary challenger, although several potential candidates on the Democratic side had been waiting to see what Inslee would do. This is important because even if the GOP fields a strong nominee, the Democratic nominee for governor will likely be favored, as Washington is 12 points more Democratic-leaning than the country as a whole1 and last elected a Republican as governor in 1980. Plus, with the gubernatorial election coinciding with the presidential contest, it will be challenging for the Republican nominee to win with President Trump at the top of the ballot, as he’s pretty unpopular in Washington state and lost there by nearly 16 percentage points in 2016.
Inslee may be out of the running for president, but winning his party’s nomination was always going to be tough. But he can take comfort in the fact that he did elevate the issue of climate change in the Democratic primary race. Plus, it must feel nice to have a good chance of being governor for four more years.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Riddler Express
From Jason Ash, a racket riddle:
You are an expert counterfeiter, and you specialize in forging one of the most ubiquitous notes in global circulation, the U.S. $100 bill. You’ve been able to fool the authorities with your carefully crafted C-notes for some time, but you’ve learned that new security features will make it impossible for you to continue to avoid detection. As a result, you decide to deposit as many fake notes as you dare before the security features are implemented and then retire from your life of crime.
You know from experience that the bank can only spot your fakes 25 percent of the time, and trying to deposit only counterfeit bills would be a ticket to jail. However, if you combine fake and real notes, there’s a chance the bank will accept your money. You have $2,500 in bona fide hundreds, plus a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeits. The bank scrutinizes cash deposits carefully: They randomly select 5 percent of the notes they receive, rounded up to the nearest whole number, for close examination. If they identify any note in a deposit as fake, they will confiscate the entire sum, leaving you only enough time to flee.
How many fake notes should you add to the $2,500 in order to maximize the expected value of your bank account? How much free money are you likely to make from your strategy?

Riddler Classic
From Tyler Barron, a pie puzzle:
You work for Puzzling Pizza, a company committed to making the best and most consistent pizzas in town. As the shop’s resident mathematician, your boss has asked you to design a product similar to one they saw online:

They’ve already purchased the equipment but need to know the exact path and flow rate the sauce-dispensing arm should use to fill a 12-inch circular pizza with sauce as fully and evenly as possible.
Similar to the video, the pizza dough sits on a platform rotating at a constant speed. The sauce-dispensing arm can travel in a straight line across the pizza and distribute sauce in a circular shape with a 0.5-inch diameter. Once the arm starts pouring sauce, it can’t stop until the pizza is done, and the sauce can only be poured onto the dough (i.e., you can’t put sauce on sauce). At the end of your routine, the pizza should have an even layer of sauce on as much of the pizza as possible.
What path and flow rate should the sauce-dispensing arm take to give you the best pizza? (Express the path as the distance from the center of the pizza with respect to angle and the flow rate as the relative flow with respect to the angle.)

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏 Matt Carlyle 👏 of Monterey, California, winner of last week’s Riddler Express!
Last week brought us to the billiard hall where we were presented with 12 billiard balls. They all looked and felt identical. However, one of the balls was slightly heavier or slightly lighter than the others, but you didn’t know which ball it was or whether it was heavier or lighter. You did, however, have a balance scale which you were allowed to use three times. You could place any equal number of balls on each side of the scale, and the scale would tilt if one side differed in weight. How could you determine which ball was different, and whether it was heavier or lighter?
This puzzle’s submitter, Corey Grodner, described how to accomplish that measuring feat. To begin with — and this is the really important bit — separate the balls into three groups. To keep track of them, label them like so: A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2, C3 and C4.
Use your scale a first time to weigh the four balls in the A group against the four balls in the B group. There are three possible scenarios that could result. One, the groups weigh the same. Two, the A balls are heavier. Three, the B balls are heavier. (The third scenario, as far as solving this puzzle goes, is essentially identical to the second scenario, so we’ll just lay out what to do in Scenarios One and Two below.)
Scenario One: Now you know for sure that the abnormal ball is in group C. You also know that all of the A and B balls are normal, and can therefore be used as controls — a handy trick in this billiard hall. Use your scale a second time to weigh C1, C2 and C3 against A1, A2 and A3. If this weighing is equal, you know C4 must be the abnormal ball and you can weigh it against A1 (your third and final use of the scale) to determine if it’s heavier or lighter than normal. If this weighing is unequal, then you know the abnormal ball is C1, C2 or C3. You can weigh C1 against C2 to find out which of the three it is, and you’ll know whether its heavier or lighter based on the results of the weighing that came before.
Scenario Two: Now you know for sure that the abnormal ball is in either group A or B — and moreover that a ball in A is heavier or a ball in B is lighter. You also know that the balls in group C are normal, and can therefore be used as controls. Use your scale a second time to weigh A1, A2, A3 and B1 against A4, C1, C2 and C3. If this weighing is equal, you know that an abnormally light ball is one of B2, B3 and B4, and you can weigh B2 against B3 (your final use) to figure out which. If that second weighing shows that the left side is heavier, you know one of A1, A2 and A3 is the culprit and you can weigh A1 against A2 to suss it out. If that second weighing shows that the right side is heavier, you know that either B1 is abnormally light or that A4 is abnormally heavy. Weigh B1 against C1 to figure it out.
Phew! Congratulations on ferreting out that pesky abnormal ball. And now that you’ve performed your three measurements, can I have my scale back, please?
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏 Zach Poole 👏 of Calgary, Alberta, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic!
Last week, we reintroduced a two-player map-coloring game. It worked like this: Call the two players Allison and Bob. On each turn, Allison draws a simple closed curve on a piece of paper. Bob then colors the interior of the “country” that curve creates with one of his many crayons. If the new country borders any existing countries, Bob must color the new country with a color different from the ones he used for the bordering countries. In last week’s edition of the game, Allison won when she forced Bob to use a seventh color. How many countries did Allison have to draw to win? (In an earlier version, only six colors were necessary for victory, and Allison had to draw eight countries to achieve that.)
If Bob is playing optimally, only using a new color if he must, Allison had to draw 12 countries to win.
Allison begins by creating a chain of countries, forcing Bob to use two colors, which alternate. After that chain is five countries long, Allison draws a country which borders two countries in the chain, forcing Bob to use a third color. She then draws a country which borders that country, as well as two countries in the chain, forcing Bob to use a fourth color. And so on. As the countries continue to overlap, of course, Bob is further forced to pull new crayons out of his box. Our winner this week, Zach, was kind enough to share an image of his work, showing that winning arrangement.
There does not appear to be a limit to how many colors Allison can eventually force Bob to use, and a pattern like the one above can grow indefinitely. Sadly, the largest box of Crayolas appears to contain only 120 different colors.

But Did He Miss His Chance?,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Senate Elections,"Chuck Schumer got his man. After months of recruitment from the Senate minority leader, and just days after he dropped out of the Democratic race for president, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper declared that he is running for the U.S. Senate.
His decision gives Democrats an obvious heavyweight candidate to take on Republican Sen. Cory Gardner. Hickenlooper owned a well-known craft brewery that was credited with helping to revitalize Denver’s LoDo neighborhood before he served two terms as that city’s mayor. Then he was elected governor in 2010 and reelected in 2014 — both years when the national environment tilted strongly toward Republicans. And two polls now — for whatever they’re worth 14 months in advance — give Hickenlooper identical 13-point leads over Gardner in the general election.
But Hickenlooper’s presidential run may have tarnished his image back home. Although he left office fairly popular (49 percent approved of his job performance in his last three months, while 30 percent disapproved), Morning Consult recently found that 41 percent of Coloradans had a favorable opinion of Hickenlooper and 37 percent had an unfavorable opinion. And Republicans will be able to attack him for the multiple times he said he wasn’t interested in the Senate during his presidential campaign. (Although we did get a preview of how Hickenlooper might parry those attacks in his Senate announcement video: “I’ve always said Washington was a lousy place for a guy like me who wants to get things done. But this is no time to walk away from the table.”)
This raises the question of how much Hickenlooper running actually helps Democrats’ chances. Lately, I’ve been pretty skeptical about the importance of “candidate quality” in this age when the “D” or “R” next to a candidate’s name seems to be all that matters — and about whether we are any good at accurately identifying strong candidates in advance. It’s also worth noting that Colorado Democrats will have plenty of choices of whom to send up against Gardner: About a dozen Democrats were already running for the Senate nomination in Colorado, and so far they don’t look likely to yield to Hickenlooper. Former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, who led one of the few polls of the primary that didn’t include Hickenlooper, has previously said he would not drop out if Hickenlooper entered the race. And state Sen. Angela Williams released a defiant statement last week warning him to stay out: “If he’s going to switch gears and run for the senate, he has a lot to explain to Colorado voters. This won’t be a coronation.”
Gardner is already one of the most vulnerable senators in the country, a Republican in a Democratic-leaning state1 who will be forced to share a ballot with President Trump in 2020. So while Hickenlooper could very well beat him, I doubt he’s the only one who could do so.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

23 candidates
And then there were … well, there’s actually still 23. Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper ended his campaign for president yesterday, trimming the Democratic field to fewer than two dozen. “I’ve heard from so many Coloradans who want me to run for the United States Senate,” Hickenlooper said in a video statement. He’s the second candidate to withdraw, following Representative Eric Swalwell of California. [The New York Times]
36 cases
A review performed by ABC News identified 36 criminal cases across the country in which President Trump was “invoked in direct connection with violent acts, threats of violence or allegations of assault.” These included perpetrators praising Trump in the midst or aftermath of physical attacks or threats, and in explanations in court of a defendant’s violent or threatening behavior. ABC News found no cases where President Barack Obama or President George W. Bush was so invoked. [ABC News]
5 articles
Over the last few years, news sites’ paywalls have gotten tighter. Whereas the average limit in 2012 was 13 free articles, it’s currently five free articles, according to a study of the practices of more than 500 American newspapers. During that same time, one assumes, the use of browsers’ incognito mode has skyrocketed. [Nieman Lab]
26 percent of Democrats
Of 304 Democratic governors and congresspeople, only 26 percent have endorsed a presidential candidate, a number which has grown only very slowly since a spate of endorsements early this year. Something similar was true for the large Republican field in 2016, and it’s “possible that, once again, endorsements may prove to be a less useful indicator when predicting who might win the nomination,” my colleague Geoffrey Skelley writes. [FiveThirtyEight]
16 million voters
As many as 16 million 2020 voters will vote using electronic machines that generate no paper trail, according to a report from the Brennan Center for Justice. (Disclosure: I worked there years ago, though not on voting issues.) Amid concerns about election security, however, experts argue that paper records are the “single best way to corroborate voting numbers.” The 16 million number is down from 27.5 million in 2016. [Popular Mechanics]
8 phones
A state trooper in Washington stopped to assist the driver of a car stopped on the shoulder of a highway south of Seattle. He discovered, however, that the driver was playing Pokemon Go on eight phones at once. Gotta catch ’em all, after all. The driver was not ticketed as he was not moving while using the devices.

1.7 million people
For more than 10 weeks, pro-democracy protestors, spurred by an extradition bill, have been out in force across Hong Kong. Over the weekend, hundreds of thousands gathered in an overflowing Victoria Park for more peaceful protests. The protest’s organizers, the Civil Human Rights Front, put the number of attendees at 1.7 million. [BBC]
$0.001 per image
Amazon’s Rekognition facial-recognition software had been able to place faces on a scale for seven emotional categories — “happy,” “sad,” “angry,” “surprised,” “disgusted,” “calm,” and “confused.” Last week, Amazon AI engineers added an eighth category — “fear.” The system can detect fear at a cost of $0.001 per image, with a discount for those totally normal people who analyze more than a million images. Alexa, I’m scared. [Wired]
“$700 million a year”
President Trump wants to buy Greenland — which, if you’ve seen “D2: The Mighty Ducks,” you know was once covered with ice and which, if you’ve followed the climate news lately, you know is less true every day. Anyway, Trump said: “Essentially, it’s a large real estate deal. A lot of things can be done. It’s hurting Denmark very badly, because they’re losing almost $700 million a year carrying it.” [Associated Press]
8 repeating FRBs
A group of Canadian scientists have detected eight fast radio bursts, or FRBs, adding to a short list of such discoveries of “these brief signals that are crossing the universe,” which last only about a millisecond. While some of these signals have been traced back to the galaxies from which they originated, their cause remains unknown. Some theories suggest that the cause is a neutron star or a similar magnetar. [CBC]
7,560 pounds of marijuana
Beneath a shipment of jalapeño peppers at a border checkpoint in San Diego were 7,560 pounds of marijuana, valued at $2.3 million, according to the Customs and Border Protection who uncovered it. If my math is correct, that’s about $304 a pound or about $19 per ounce, and so if my, uh, reading on the subject is correct, that’s a whole lot of not great pot. [NBC News]
5 linguists
Five linguists at the City University of New York are nearing the end of a three-year project to document the “New Yawk” accent and “to catalog just what makes the dialect so distinctively New York.” The researchers employed undergrads across the five boroughs to record interviews. They found dropped R’s, nasally A’s, and “a trademark spin on the first vowel in words like coffee, making it cawfee.” Hey, undergrad, I’m walking heeah. [New York Daily News]

74 percent of economists
Seventy-four percent of American business economists, as surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics, “appear sufficiently concerned about the risks of some of President Donald Trump’s economic policies that they expect a recession in the U.S. by the end of 2021.” Trump, for his part, said over the weekend that “I don’t think we’re having a recession. We’re doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut and they’re loaded up with money.” [Associated Press]
$2 billion contest
An “eclectic band of NASA skeptics” — including Newt Gingrich, a former publicist for Michael Jackson and an Air Force lieutenant general — are pitching President Trump a “reality show-style plan” to get humans back to the moon. It involves a $2 billion contest between billionaires such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to see who can establish the first base on the lunar surface. Honestly, I would watch this show. [Politico]
7-figure donation
Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors star, following a conversation he had with a Howard University student about their mutual love of golf, is giving a seven-figure donation to the historically black university to sponsor the school’s first competitive golf team in decades. The new team is thought to be the first Division I golf team in Howard’s history. [The Washington Post]
181 CEOs
Nearly 200 CEOs belonging to the Business Roundtable — including the chiefs of J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Apple, Amazon, Boeing and GM — signed a statement Monday concerning “the purpose of a corporation.” The statement appears to shift away from the ultimate notion that shareholder value is the main objective. Rather, it says, that the companies commit to delivering value to customers, investing in employees, dealing fairly with suppliers and supporting communities in which they work. We shall see. [CNBC]
At least 5 states
Move over bamboo bags and statement sneakers. One of the hottest trends of 2019 is recalling governors. Of the 19 states (plus the District of Columbia) that allow such maneuvers, recall efforts are underway in at least five, my colleague Nathaniel Rakich writes. Moreover, 20 of the 45 state-level recall elections in American history have taken place in just the last decade. [FiveThirtyEight]
$30 … er, $13 million
Up for auction at RM Sotheby’s in California this past weekend was what is often known as the “first Porsche” — a Nazi-era “avant-garde coupe” built by Ferdinand Porsche years before the founding of his car company. The bidding was meant to begin at $13 million but — perhaps thanks to the auctioneer’s accent and/or an error on a screen — began at $30 million and increased in increments of $10 million. A final bid of “$70 million” was eventually adjudged to actually be $17 million, but in any case the car didn’t sell as it didn’t meet its reserve price. [The New York Times]

Elizabeth Warren overtook Sen. Bernie Sanders to claim second place in the Real Clear Politics average of national primary polls, a position she’s had for a little over a week now. It’s the first time she’s claimed that spot, apart from a one-day blip back in July.
It was just a handful of months ago that Warren was polling fifth or sixth nationally, with numbers in the mid-single digits. And following the backlash to the release of her DNA test, she seemed like a long shot. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew discusses Warren’s comeback and whether she has staying power.
The team also discusses the conversation about mass shootings and white nationalist terrorism in the two weeks since the shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

Could He Lose In 2020?,Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Rep. Steve King is no stranger to controversy. The Republican congressman’s recent comments about rape and incest have Republican leaders calling for his ouster, and this is just the latest entry on King’s laundry list of insensitive and racist statements. Nevertheless, King says he’s running for reelection in 2020.
But this could be the end of the line for King. He faces a serious challenge in the Republican primary and, if he overcomes that, a potential general election rematch with J.D. Scholten, the Democrat who gave King a close race in 2018.
Indeed, King’s problems predate 2019. In the final stretch of the 2018 campaign, he came under fire for comments saying diversity is not a strength and for his ties to far-right political figures in the wake of a shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. National Republicans disavowed him, and King only narrowly defeated Scholten by 3 percentage points — a far cry from King’s typical 20-plus-point margins of victory in Iowa’s 4th District, which was about 22 points more Republican than the country as a whole in 2018.1 As the table below shows, King’s performance was the third-worst of any Republican incumbent seeking reelection in 2018 relative to the partisan lean of the incumbent’s district.

FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric is the average difference between how a state votes and how the country votes overall, with 2016 presidential election results weighted at 50 percent, 2012 presidential election results weighted at 25 percent and results from elections for the state legislature weighted at 25 percent.

Despite his controversial statements and calls by some Republicans for King to resign, King seems intent on sticking around. But that will be easier said than done. Just prior to the controversial New York Times interview, Republican state Sen. Randy Feenstra decided to seek King’s seat, setting up a primary clash. And the incumbent may struggle to amass the resources to fend off such a serious primary challenge: At the end of June, King had less than $20,000 in his campaign account, far behind Feenstra’s nearly $340,000.
Of course, King could still win his primary. He has long-standing ties to Republican activists, and his conservative bona fides might be enough to overcome his many controversial statements.
Additionally, Iowa election rules could give King a chance even if he fails to win the most primary votes. According to state law, if no candidate wins at least 35 percent of the primary vote, a district party convention decides the nomination. The primary vote would have to be split many ways for that to happen, but it’s a real possibility because two other Republicans are also running — Army veteran Bret Richards and Woodbury County Supervisor Jeremy Taylor. With four Republican candidates in the race,2 it’s conceivable that no one will surpass 35 percent.
While unusual, such nominating conventions in U.S. House races are not unheard of. In fact, King got his start with one: When King first ran for Congress in 2002, no Republican won more than 35 percent in a four-way primary, and King won the GOP nomination at the ensuing convention. Most recently, a convention was used in 2014 when Republicans in Iowa’s 3rd District picked David Young from a six-candidate field to be the party’s nominee.3 Conventions can be unpredictable, but activists who participate in those kind of party events tend to be more ideologically extreme than rank-and-file voters, so King might be favored at one.
Should King make it to the general election, he probably would be favored to win as the Republican nominee in a district where President Trump won 61 percent of the vote in 2016. But Scholten’s candidacy on the Democratic side could make for a close contest. In their 2018 race, Scholten raised nearly four times as much money as King, and the former minor league baseball player made headlines when he announced his 2020 bid in a video narrated by Kevin Costner, the star of the film Field of Dreams, which takes place in Iowa. In 2018, Scholten benefited from a heavily Democratic-leaning national environment, and once again he will probably need friendly conditions to have a chance in the strongly Republican district. Still, Scholten’s 2018 performance suggests that he might be the only Democrat who could win the seat.
No matter how 2020 pans out for King, his standing in Republican circles has fallen spectacularly. Despite his history of controversial comments, King was once — excuse the obvious pun — a kingmaker in conservative political circles. This was particularly obvious in previous presidential cycles, when Republicans looking to win Iowa’s caucuses would cozy up to King in the hopes of getting his support. Even if he survives to win another term in Congress, it’s difficult to see King getting that kind of royal treatment again. And he’s looking more vulnerable in 2020 than he ever has before.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

936 accounts
Twitter removed 936 accounts from its service — and suspended some 200,000 more — citing a “significant state-backed information operation” coming from within China and targeting the pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. The accounts in question had apparently accused the protesters of violence and and of being sponsored by governments in the West. [The Guardian]
50 percent of Americans
Only 50 percent of Americans say that colleges and universities “have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country,” a fact reflective of “an undercurrent of dissatisfaction,” per the Pew Research Center, having to do with how admissions decisions are made and the constraint of free speech on campuses. These views are sharply partisan — 67 percent of Democrats think the institutions have a positive effect compared to 33 percent of Republicans. [Pew Research Center]
127 Democrats
The fourth-ranking House Democrat — Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, currently the assistant speaker — has announced his support for an impeachment investigation into President Trump. That makes Luján the highest-ranking Democrat and the 127th Democrat overall to support impeachment, according to a count by Politico. That leaves 108 Democrats who do not, at least yet, support impeachment or an impeachment inquiry. [Politico]
99 percent of bananas
Ninety-nine percent of exported bananas are of the Cavendish variety. And the Cavendish is facing an “existential crisis” in the form of a fungus called Tropical Race 4 which infects bananas plants through their roots and has spread from Asia to Latin America. Salvation may come, however, thanks to Crispr gene-editing which could make Cavendishes that are resistant to the fungus. Mmmm, crisper bananas. [Wired]
22 towns
Beginning late last week, 22 mostly small towns in Texas were hit with ransomware attacks, by which computer systems are compromised and a ransom demanded for their functioning return, thought by the Texas Department of Information Resources to be the work of “one single threat actor.” While none of the Texas towns were known to have paid the ransom, a study by Recorded Future showed that 17 percent of municipalities do. [NPR]
Between 50 and 100 air mattresses
Some 150 beds and pillows were arranged in Denver this past weekend for an outdoor summertime screening of “Captain Marvel.” When the wind picked up, dozens of the air mattresses took flight, “a herd of air mattresses” according to a witness who filmed an estimated 50 to 100 beds “rampaging” over walls and into pools. The video has since been set to “Ride of the Valkyries” and the theme from “Jurassic Park.” Life, uh, finds a way. [The Washington Post]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/economists-are-bad-at-predicting-recessions/,2019-08-21,,,features,"Aug. 21, 2019",Economists Are Bad At Predicting Recessions,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Every president’s election-year nightmare — a recession — is suddenly looming over the 2020 race. In a survey released earlier this week by the National Association of Business Economics, 38 percent of economists predicted that the country will slip into an economic downturn next year, and another recent poll of economists put the chances of a recession in the next 12 months at 1 in 3. Those predictions are getting a lot of attention, and it’s not hard to see why — an economic slowdown in the middle of the presidential election cycle could reshape the race, potentially changing the calculus of Democratic primary voters and undermining President Trump, who has made the strong economy a central selling point of his presidency.
But take a deep breath before you spend a lot of time trying to figure out how a recession would change Trump’s reelection chances: Although the economy does have a big effect on an incumbent president’s odds of winning a second term, economists have a terrible track record when it comes to predicting recessions.
“Very, very few recessions have been predicted nine months or a year in advance,” Prakash Loungani, an economist at the International Monetary Fund, told me.
This doesn’t mean a recession won’t strike in the near future. Over the past few weeks and months, there have been some worrisome signals about the country’s economic health, fueling broader concerns about an impending recession. But exactly when the next economic downturn will come — and specifically whether it will interrupt the 2020 election cycle — is extremely uncertain. “There’s no economic data or research or analysis that suggests we can look 12 months into the future and predict recessions with any confidence,” said Tara Sinclair, a professor of economics at George Washington University.
Instead, and despite the recent rash of stories about economists’ predictions, economic downturns usually come as a surprise. A 2018 study conducted by Loungani and others looked at 153 recessions in 63 countries between 1992 and 2014 and found that the vast majority were missed by economists in both the public and private sector. This was painfully true in the case of the global financial crisis in 2008, which wasn’t officially declared a recession until it had been going for almost a year. Other studies have found that in general, forecasters are too sunny about economic growth.
Part of the problem, according to Loungani, was that in the past, economists were unwilling to risk their reputations by predicting an imminent recession that never came to pass. So it might actually be a good thing, he said, if more economists were now willing to sound the alarm. But Sinclair noted that even now, relatively few are pointing to an immediate crisis. In one of the polls, for instance, the share of economists who said they were expecting a recession this year fell from 10 percent in February to 2 percent in July.
And even if economists are more willing to be wrong these days than they were a decade ago, the task of predicting recessions itself hasn’t become easier. We have plenty of clues about how the economy is doing, but a system that’s so big, complex and deeply intertwined with human psychology and actions will always be difficult to predict.
Recently, for instance, the financial world flew into a tizzy over the inverted yield curve, which is generally seen as a reliable harbinger of an economic downturn. An inverted yield curve appears when short-term investments pay more than long-term ones, and it generally reflects a pessimistic mood among investors about the economy’s future performance. When the yield curve stays inverted for three months — as it did earlier this year — that’s a clear sign that a recession could be coming, according to research by Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University. But it’s not a guarantee, since an inverted yield curve doesn’t itself cause a recession. Instead, it’s a reflection of how investors feel about the economy’s future — and those feelings could be off-base. Other economists, like Sinclair, also said they’re not sure yet what the inverted yield curve means — and Harvey added that although it has a good predictive track record, it’s just one signal in a complex economic landscape.
Even if the inverted yield curve proves prescient and a downturn does come, we don’t have a good way to pinpoint when it will hit. According to Harvey, recessions have followed inverted yield curves by anywhere between six and 22 months. That’s not a small range, especially in political terms — it’s the difference between an economic slowdown that begins just before the Iowa caucuses and a recession that starts five months after the next presidential inauguration.
And in the meantime, consumers, investors and policymakers will all keep doing things that affect the economy. It’s possible that the anxious headlines about an impending recession could become self-fulfilling if everyday people respond by saving their money instead of spending it. Or maybe the opposite will happen, and smart policy responses to early warning signals could ward off a recession or make it less damaging.
Either way, the unpredictability of human behavior will frustrate anyone trying to pin down exactly when a recession will arrive. That doesn’t mean economists should stop making forecasts or that signals like the inverted yield curve aren’t useful. But anyone looking at predictions about when the next recession will land should take those forecasts with a big grain of salt. “Given historical patterns, a recession is likely to come again, so we need to be talking about what we’re going to do when it hits,” Sinclair said. “But we have to be open about the fact that we don’t really know when that will be.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-a-40-homer-season-a-big-deal-anymore/,2019-08-21,,,features,"Aug. 21, 2019",Is A 40-Homer Season A Big Deal Anymore?,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"The baseball world hasn’t witnessed a home run race like this since the height of the steroid era.
When Mets star Pete Alonso set the National League rookie home run record on Sunday, he joined Mike Trout, Christian Yelich and Cody Bellinger in this season’s 40-homer club … in the middle of August.
According to data from Baseball-Reference.com, Alonso’s blast in Kansas City marked the first time that four hitters have reached 40 or more homers through their teams’ 125th game played since 2001, when it was accomplished by Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Luis Gonzalez and Jim Thome. It was just the third time in Major League Baseball history,1 with 1998 marking the other occasion (Sosa, Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr, Greg Vaughn). Bonds hit 54 home runs through 125 games in 2001, the most in history.
Total home runs are on pace to shatter the MLB record this season, and three of the top four seasons by total home runs have come in the past four years. But until this year, individual season totals had fallen short of those of the steroid era. Though Giancarlo Stanton made it to 59 homers in 2017, the last hitters to reach 60 were Bonds and Sosa in 2001. Perhaps after 20-plus years of wondering what to do with homers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, this generation will have to wrestle how to place today’s homer binge, thought to be fueled by livelier balls and higher launch angles, in context.
Trout, Yelich, Bellinger and Alonso could perhaps challenge the 50- or even 60-homer mark this fall. But right behind them are 12 more players who have hit at least 30 homers through play Tuesday and 14 more who have hit at least 28. We could have a double-digit population of 40-homer hitters for the first time since 2006. From 1996 through 2001, at least 12 players reached 40 home runs each season, including a record 17 in 1996.
The baseball itself is viewed as a primary culprit in the game’s overall home run surge. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has admitted that the construction of the ball is producing less drag, which means that the ball can fly farther. But Alonso, Bellinger, Trout and Yelich are reminders that it’s more complicated that just the makeup of the ball. They aren’t hitting many “cheap” home runs.
Through Tuesday, the four each ranked in the top 24 of average home run distance, according to Statcast projections. Trout is fourth in the game with an average of 417 feet per homer, followed by Alonso at sixth (413 feet), Yelich at 19th (406) and Bellinger at 24th (404 feet). And five players have hit at least 25 home runs with a distance of 400 feet or more through Tuesday: Trout (29), Bellinger (28), Alonso (27), Yelich (26) and Ronald Acuña Jr. (25).
The approaches of the four home run leaders likely also have a big hand in their big numbers. Bellinger changed his swing in the offseason and has cut his strikeout rate, increased his walk rate and dramatically raised his isolated power. After being one of the most ground-ball oriented hitters in the game from 2015 through 2017, Yelich changed his approach and swing after being traded from Miami to Milwaukee last year and has enjoyed 44.6 percent of his fly balls going for home runs since July 1, 2018 — the second best mark in baseball. Trout has long been the best player in the game, but he’s quietly been evolving as he’s raised his average launch angle to a career-high 21.3 degrees this season, ranking 13th in baseball.
While record strikeout rates are one trend that could prevent individual home run records from falling, Bellinger, Yelich and Trout are proving that some batters can hit with elite power and below-average K totals — and that increased launch angle doesn’t always mean increased strikeout totals. Alonso is just a rookie, but he’s reduced the share of balls he’s hit to the opposite field in each of his past three seasons, including minor league play.
For better or worse, 40 homers might soon not mean what it used to.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-approval-rating-is-incredibly-steady-is-that-weird-or-the-new-normal/,2019-08-20,,,features,"Mar. 28, 2019",Trump’s Approval Rating Is Incredibly Steady. Is That Weird Or The New Normal?,Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,Presidential Approval,"If there’s one thing that’s been consistent about President Trump’s time in office, it’s his approval rating. Sure, it has moved around a bit — his average approval has hovered between 36 percent and 45 percent, a fluctuation of 9 points, over practically the entire course of his presidency, according to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker. But that’s a really narrow band, especially compared to previous presidents, and it has meant that his median approval rating is low — only President Harry Truman had a lower median rating. Trump’s approval rating has the least variation of any post-World War II president. Granted, Trump hasn’t yet served a full term, but changes in his approval rating have been remarkably small.
The chart below plots every presidential approval poll we have, highlighting each president’s median approval rating and the range in which the middle 50 percent of their approval ratings fell during their time in office.1 The lighter bars out to the sides represent the range of ratings covered by the 25 percent of polls that were lower than this middle group and the 25 percent that were higher. And as you can see, half of Trump’s approval polls fall within a tight window of about 5 points, between 39 percent and 44 percent. The only other president to rival that narrow range is Obama, whose approval rating fell between 45 and 50 percent in about half of all polls. But Obama had a wider overall range of approval ratings, which helped him achieve a higher median approval rating in part because, like most other presidents, Obama had what is called a “honeymoon period” — a stretch of high approval ratings early in his presidency. Trump, on the other hand, seems to have had no honeymoon period to speak of — he’s been below 45 percent in FiveThirtyEight’s average since the first week of his presidency, and the highest approval rating he’s had in our tracker was 48 percent on Jan. 25, 2017, just five days after his inauguration. The highest approval rating he’s had in an individual poll is 59 percent, which is the lowest top mark for any modern president.
Now, Trump has only been in office for a little over two years, and most of the presidents in our data set served for between four and eight years. Since spending more time in office means a president has higher odds of serving during an event that could dramatically affect his approval ratings — economic instability or an unpopular military operation that could send opinion sharply downward, for example, or the end of a war or the aftermath of a terrorist attack, which could cause approval to spike — it’s certainly still possible that something will happen before Trump leaves office that could break his approval rating out of this narrow band. Nonetheless, it is striking that the past two presidents are the ones with the least variation in their approval ratings, even though Trump is only halfway through his first term.
So what explains this lack of movement in recent presidents’ approval ratings?
For starters, Trump is arguably the most polarizing president ever — in his second year in office, an average of 87 percent of Republicans approved of the president while just 8 percent of Democrats did, the widest such gap that Gallup has ever found. But this kind of partisan split was almost as wide under Obama, though not until his final year in office.
As Democrats and Republicans move farther apart politically, the specifics of a president’s job performance may become secondary considerations for voters in forming an opinion of how he’s doing. “People are more likely to judge candidates and policies solely on the basis of their party,” said Christopher Federico, a professor of political psychology at the University of Minnesota. “If everything boils down to party, then there’s less room for other stuff that a president might be held responsible for — like a bad economy or increased casualties in a foreign military engagement — to move that president’s approval around.”
This means despite near-constant headlines proclaiming “chaos” in the White House, Trump has seen little swing in his approval rating. Events just don’t seem to move a president’s approval rating as much as they once did. Rachel Bitecofer, a professor of political science at Christopher Newport University, told me that for past presidents, newsworthy events were linked to notable fluctuations in presidential approval. “When you look at Nixon, something will happen and people will be like, ‘Woo, Nixon!’ Then Watergate happens and there are huge swings in opinion.” Whereas for Trump, Bitecofer said, “there’s almost no response in the public opinion data.” This has also meant that Trump’s support among Republicans has remained consistently strong throughout his presidency, almost always staying above 80 percent approval in Gallup’s data. Tellingly, GOP members of Congress have rarely broken with the president, and typically only over foreign policy concerns.
But it’s also possible that these steady numbers are not as much about partisan polarization as we think. It could have everything to do with personality. Lara Brown, the director of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University, said that the small movement we see in Trump and Obama’s approval ratings “may be the ultimate expression of the personalization of the presidency.” That is, loyalty to the president rather than loyalty to the party could be driving the intensely polarized views of the latest presidents. As an example, Brown pointed to the fact that Democrats and Republicans stuck with their presidential standard bearers despite the president’s party suffering major midterm losses in 2010, 2014 and 2018. Personality-driven politics might make sense in an era where parties are increasingly weak, meaning they don’t exert the same amount of clout over candidates as they once did. Trump is a great example of this, as he had a mixed political history and wasn’t a textbook conservative before he ran for the 2016 Republican nomination and won.
We may yet see big swings in Trump’s approval — we can’t say when the next seismic economic or foreign policy event might occur. But so far, at least, Trump is exhibiting an even greater degree of stasis than Obama did when it comes to job approval. Given how deeply divided American politics is and how polarizing Trump is, don’t be surprised if his ratings remain steady regardless of what’s going on around him.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/governor-recall-elections/,2019-08-20,,,features,"Aug. 19, 2019",There Are 5 Governors Being Targeted For Recalls,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,State Government,"Recall elections were once a rarely used, “break glass in case of emergency” tool to remove politicians from office. But now, several factors have conspired to make this the most active decade for recall elections in U.S. history — and there may be more to come in the next several months.
Out of 19 states (plus the District of Columbia) that allow for the recall of state officials, efforts are currently underway to recall governors in at least five.1 In New Jersey, Colorado and Oregon, elections officials have given organizers the OK to collect signatures to get a recall on the ballot. In Alaska, a group to recall Gov. Mike Dunleavy has formally registered with the state and is currently circulating a petition to receive official approval. There’s also a fifth effort underway in California, but multiple observers of California politics told FiveThirtyEight they don’t consider it to be serious; after all, recall attempts are more like a fact of life in the Golden State, as there have been 49 attempts to recall a California governor in the last 106 years. And a sixth state may soon join the ranks, as opponents of Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak say they’ll kick off a formal recall effort in the fall.
However, it would be a historically rare occurrence if any of these recalls qualify for the ballot. Only four gubernatorial recall efforts have ever done so: in 1921 in North Dakota, in 1988 in Arizona (though the election was canceled after the governor was impeached), in 2003 in California and in 2012 in Wisconsin. And it’s rarer still for governors to then go on and lose their recall election: It’s only happened twice in all of American history.2
Given this, five gubernatorial recall attempts is a notably high number. But recalls have gotten more common in recent years — especially at the beginning of this decade. According to Joshua Spivak, a senior fellow at Wagner College’s Hugh L. Carey Institute for Government Reform who runs a blog on recall elections, 20 of the 45 state-level recall elections in U.S. history have taken place in just the last 10 years.
Devised as a Progressive-era reform around 100 years ago, recalls were originally intended to punish politicians who had committed crimes or other misdeeds. But they’re much more often used to express unhappiness with the officeholder’s politics. That’s certainly the case with these recalls: In four of this year’s gubernatorial recall efforts, conservatives are trying to recall Democratic governors for supporting “leftist, radical, progressive bills,” in the words of the spokeswoman for the campaign against Colorado Gov. Jared Polis. GOP opponents of Oregon Gov. Kate Brown cited her support for a cap-and-trade program and a bill granting driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants as grounds for a recall. In Colorado, recall petitions cite the state’s new oil and gas regulations, efforts to circumvent the Electoral College and a “red flag” gun-control law.3 But it’s not just conservatives attempting recalls. In Alaska, Democrats are targeting Dunleavy for massive cuts to the state budget, including 41 percent of state funding for the University of Alaska system and $334,000 from the state court system in retribution for its rulings in favor of state-funded abortions. (Under pressure from constituents, Dunleavy announced last week that he would roll back some of the vetoes, including reducing the cuts to the public university system.)
Unsurprisingly, then, intense partisanship is frequently cited as a reason for the increase in recalls this decade. Critics contend that many recalls are just attempts to redo an election after a result the other side didn’t like; for example, they have recently been a popular tactic among Western Republicans as their influence in states like California and Nevada has declined. As political scientist and FiveThirtyEight contributor Seth Masket noted in 2013, “if you have these tools lying around, they’re simply too tempting for a member of an aggrieved minority party to ignore.” But partisanship is probably not the entire story. As Spivak put it, “Increased partisanship may be a factor, but then again, it’s not like we haven’t had previous very partisan moments in American politics.”
Shaun Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California, Riverside, who studies recalls, believes a more precise explanation for the recent popularity of recall elections may be the decrease of civility in politics and a rise in anti-incumbent sentiment. “There is this general decline in regard for politics/politicians,” Bowler wrote in an email, “and the politicians themselves encourage that.” Spivak, on the other hand, told me that he thinks better technology is actually the number-one reason. The internet has simultaneously made recall campaigns cheaper and made it easier for them to raise money. Social media helps angry voters find each other; smartphones and spreadsheets make coordinating their efforts far simpler. And citizens can even download a recall petition, print it out and sign it (or get their family and friends to sign it) on the spot.
Another reason recalls may be on the rise is that power brokers are increasingly willing to put their muscle behind them. National organizations (e.g., labor unions or the National Rifle Association) have underwritten recent recall campaigns with seven-figure investments. This year, the Alaska effort is being chaired by “heavy hitters” like a wealthy coal executive and Alaska’s last living founding father. And in Colorado and Oregon, leaders of the state GOP have even supported the recall efforts, which is historically unusual. In Oregon, the state party itself initiated one of the two recall attempts of Brown and has aggressively promoted it online.
Will these factors help any of the five gubernatorial recall attempts advance to an actual election? It’s certainly a tall order for petitioners — they must collect a huge number of signatures in a short amount of time. It looks least likely in Colorado, where organizers must collect more than 10,000 signatures a day by Sept. 6 despite being grossly underfunded. The task is less daunting in Oregon, where the non-party-led recall effort said it had collected 70,000 signatures (about a quarter of the required number) in just two weeks, with two and a half months to go. And last month, recall organizers in New Jersey claimed they had collected 300,000 signatures in about three months, an impressive number but behind the pace they need to collect 1.5 million signatures in 320 days.

Numerically, it looks likeliest in Alaska, where petitioners have almost three years to collect only 28,501 signatures to submit a recall application, then 71,252 more to actually force a vote.4 Organizers say they have already reached the first goal — and in only two weeks to boot — but they will continue to gather signatures until Sept. 2. However, the effort will probably face a legal challenge. Alaska is one of only eight states that require a specific reason to recall elected officials, and it is unclear whether the Dunleavy recall effort meets one of the four criteria: lack of fitness, incompetence, neglect of duties or corruption. According to Spivak, only one state-level recall election has ever taken place in a state that requires specific grounds for recall.5
So this year’s recalls face long odds of success. But even a failed recall attempt can have lasting impacts. Some recall targets have complained that the revolts poisoned the political waters around them, damaging their relationship with voters. Political science research also suggests that elected officials may react to attempts to recall members of their party by moving toward the center. In other words, recalls may be effective at scaring politicians into taking less controversial stances in an effort to avoid the ire of opposing activists. On the other hand, they may also backfire on the side organizing the recalls. Noting that even successful recalls in Wisconsin6 and California did not stop Democrats and Republicans, respectively, from continuing to lose ground in those states, Spivak posits that the general electorate may see recall attempts against “overreaching” politicians as an overreach of their own.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Liberal Democrats thought he was too hawkish, while foreign policy experts in Washington, particularly Republicans, slammed him for being too much of a dove.
The liberals may have won that debate — at least within the Democratic Party. The next Democratic president may be significantly more anti-war than Obama; that is, wary of deploying or increasing the number of American troops anywhere. That’s at least the general consensus on foreign policy and national security that emerged from the 15 Democratic presidential candidates (both from the party’s left and left-center wings) who responded to FiveThirtyEight’s eight-question survey on their foreign policy stances.1
Before we get to the results, a few brief notes on our questions. Obviously, it’s hard to confine foreign policy to eight questions, so we tried to avoid subjects in which we thought the candidates would all have the same answer. For example, virtually all Democratic candidates would reengage the U.S. in the Paris climate accord. We also tried to avoid topics for which we couldn’t come up with a fairly concise question. It’s a safe bet that any of the Democratic candidates, if elected president, would be more critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin than President Trump has been, but it’s hard to design a question that would illustrate the differences between the candidates on that subject. So there are some major foreign policy issues (like how the U.S. should deal with Russia) that are not represented.2
Here are the results:
The clearest conclusion is that the candidates generally favored four anti-war stances as a bloc; this includes not only more liberal candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but also more center-left figures such as Michael Bennet and Amy Klobuchar:
Ending the U.S. involvement in Yemen. All 15 would end the Trump administration’s policy of the U.S. military offering logistical and other support to the government in Yemen in the country’s civil war against the Houthi rebels. This is not particularly surprising: Both houses of Congress earlier this year passed a resolution calling for the end of American involvement in the civil war. Democrats on Capitol Hill voted overwhelmingly in favor of the resolution, which was vetoed by Trump.3
Getting rid of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). All 15 generally support the repeal of the AUMF. That provision was initially passed in the wake of 9/11 as Congress’s way of greenlighting U.S. attacks on al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan. But it has also been used by the George W. Bush, Obama and Trump administrations to justify deployment of U.S. forces anywhere those administrations saw as a terrorist threat — without any additional approval from Congress. Repealing this measure, in theory, would force Congress to pass a new provision authorizing U.S. forces to fight terrorism. (And several candidates said the U.S. should pass a new AUMF if it gets rid of the 2001 version.) A new AUMF would likely be more limited in scope and give more power to Congress in deploying U.S. troops to conflicts abroad.
Getting all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. Ten of the 15 also said they would look to remove all U.S. troops from Afghanistan in their first term. This was a bit surprising to me. On the one hand, the conflict in Afghanistan has become known as a “Forever War” — U.S. troops have been there for nearly 20 years. On the other hand, the removal of nearly all troops from Iraq during the Obama years was blamed for creating an atmosphere that allowed for the rise of the Islamic State group.
Reducing overall defense spending. Twelve of the 15 also support a net decrease in defense spending. The U.S. spent more than $600 billion on defense in 2018, a total that is more than a third of overall global spending on defense and dwarfs the military budgets of China ($250 billion) and Russia (approximately $60 billion) combined. I figured liberal candidates like Sanders would take this stance but was surprised that many of the more centrist Democrats did, too.
“We could cut our spending by a third and still spend more than all of our global adversaries combined,” Tim Ryan said in a statement from his campaign. “I would like to see the money allocated to economic stimulus, reducing our national debt and given back to the states for investments in public schools, infrastructure, and job training programs.”
Many of the campaigns did not respond to our questionnaire, most notably those of Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. (The Biden and Harris campaigns also did not respond by our publication date to our previous questionnaire on criminal justice reform.) That said, from other reporting, it’s fair to say that Biden, Buttigieg and Harris are part of the general consensus of foreign policy views among the candidates. For example, all three support the end of U.S. military involvement in Yemen, and Buttigieg backs the effort to repeal the 2001 AUMF.
The candidates were also basically unified around four other issues that didn’t necessarily fit into a broader frame (as the questions about military spending and use of force did).
Keeping the U.S. Embassy in Israel in Jerusalem. Foreign policy experts and some Democrats harshly criticized the Trump administration when it moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem last year. But only three candidates, all long shots — Joe Sestak, Andrew Yang and Marianne Williamson — said they would move it back to Tel Aviv. That the candidates were broadly unwilling to reverse Trump’s move is perhaps evidence that the pro-Israel part of the Democratic Party still has some sway, even as Democratic voters are becoming skeptical of Israel’s government. There was a bit of an ideological split among candidates on this question. More moderate candidates like Booker and Beto O’Rourke clearly stated that they would not move the embassy, while liberals like Warren and Sanders were more noncommittal on that issue.
Being noncommittal on meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un without “preconditions.” Most of the candidates emphasized that they wanted to meet with Kim but would want to have some parameters for such a meeting. (So basically “no,” but they likely didn’t want to say “no” and seem resistant to diplomacy.)
Supporting measures to pressure Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro to leave power but emphasizing that the U.S. should involve itself in a diplomatic process and not deploy forces there.
Leaving the door open to continuing some kind of tariffs on China. Generally, the candidates attacked Trump for conducting trade policy in a way that is “reckless,” a word invoked by the campaigns of Bennet, O’Rourke and John Delaney. But nearly all of the candidates also criticized China for what they cast as unfair trade practices.
I don’t want to suggest that the Democratic candidates agree on everything in terms of foreign policy. I think it’s clear that a Warren administration would be more favorable to tariffs than that of the more establishment Delaney. Biden has already rejected the idea of a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and would likely be less anti-war and anti-interventionist than, say, Sanders. And maybe different questions would have yielded a bigger spread among the candidates.
That said, at least compared with economic policy (where there is a clear divide between the left and left-center Democrats on issues like “Medicare for All”), foreign policy is an area where the ideological fissures of the party are less pronounced.
I think the unity among the candidates is striking. As a group, they seem to be previewing a more anti-war foreign policy approach than Obama’s.
CORRECTION (Aug. 20, 2019, 3:04 p.m.): The chart and the text in this article have been updated to more accurately reflect the questions we sent to campaigns. In particular, results for the question about Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro have been changed to reflect the fact that we asked whether candidates support using “diplomatic, economic or other means” to pressure him to leave office, as opposed to only military force. We’ve also included those questions in full in a footnote.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

The transcript below has been lightly edited.


sarahf (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): On Tuesday, Joe Biden launched his campaign’s first television ad of the 2020 cycle, leaning into his time spent as Barack Obama’s vice president and his performance in head-to-head polls against President Trump. And according to an ABC News analysis of TV ads, Biden is now the seventh Democratic presidential candidate to have run an ad so far. (The others: Julián Castro, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Tom Steyer.)
But, of course, the media landscape is changing, and many candidates are focusing on digital ad buys, too. So let’s talk about the role of ads in a presidential cycle — what is the role they play in mobilizing voters, and how do they help (or hurt) campaigns? And what role do we expect campaign ads to play here in 2020?
First up, though — let’s talk about that Biden ad and the other TV ads we’ve seen from candidates so far. What do we make of that Biden ad? It’s pretty similar to the video announcing his campaign launch in April, yes?
nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, elections analyst): Yeah, like his launch video, he grounds the ad — and his reason for running — in the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.
He also very explicitly makes the point that he was Obama’s number two, and that is why people should vote for him.
ameliatd (Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, senior writer): The new ad also focuses on Biden’s other big argument — that he’s the candidate best positioned to beat Trump. He goes there right away.
nrakich: Yep. The ad even has a graphic of several early general-election polls!
Of course, we at FiveThirtyEight know that those aren’t reliable predictors of what will actually happen in more than a year’s time.
meredithconroy: (Meredith Conroy, political science professor at California State University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): If I’m running for president (and I will, #Conroy2032), “strong, steady, stable” are words I want people to associate with me and my campaign. Those words are always relevant to presidential leadership, but they seem to be a core part of Biden’s strategy in the context of 2019, when Trump is president.
nrakich: Right, the ad yearns for the days when we had an administration “our kids could look up to” and calls Trump “an erratic, vicious, bullying president.”
sarahf: How does Biden’s first ad buy fit into the other ones we’ve seen? I know it’s early (only seven candidates have even made a TV ad buy), but what else is out there? I know Castro, for instance, released an ad after the shooting in El Paso that positioned himself against Trump, as well — but he struck a very different tone than Biden.
nrakich: I thought Castro’s ad was very strong.


A message for @realdonaldtrump: pic.twitter.com/WFYRxm69hA
— Julián Castro (@JulianCastro) August 13, 2019

He speaks directly to the camera about how the alleged gunman in the El Paso shooting used language similar to President Trump’s when writing about his motivations for the attack, and I think Castro comes across as a very effective messenger because he makes it so personal. He says people who “look like me, [who] look like my family” (i.e., Latinos) have come under attack during the Trump administration. And as Amelia wrote recently, many Latinos in the U.S. say things have gotten worse under Trump.
So for a candidate like Castro, who has struggled to get media attention, I think it was a smart move. He didn’t spend a lot of money on the ad ($2,775 according to NBC), yet many media outlets have written about it, so it probably had an outsized impact for what he spent.
meredithconroy: Right, unlike Biden, Castro has more room to build up his image since he is not as well known. And this ad suggests he wants to be known as someone who will go directly at Trump, especially when it comes to Trump’s impact on a community he cares about.
ameliatd: It was interesting strategically, too! It was a tiny ad buy like Nathaniel said, but it was during Fox and Friends. So he wasn’t just talking directly to Trump in the ad — he was actually trying to ensure Trump would see it.
It makes you wonder if other candidates will try to get free coverage by needling Trump with their ads.
sarahf: What about a candidate like Kamala Harris, though? She mentions Trump in her ad, but he definitely isn’t the focal point.

Structurally though, I thought it was kind of similar to Biden’s latest ad. The message is different, but it’s still introducing her to voters and letting them know what she’d fight for.
nrakich: Yeah, to me, Harris’s ad had the feel of a general-election ad. It’s very empathetic, and the policies it mentions (e.g., equal pay for women, a generic call for “Medicare for all”) are popular with the general public and extremely popular among Democrats.
That said, I found it less effective than Biden’s or Castro’s. Maybe the average voter won’t have this reaction, but to me, “3 a.m. agenda” is too close to Hillary Clinton’s “3 a.m. phone call” ad from 2008.
That ad had a very different message, though — instead of “what issues keep you up at 3 a.m.?” (a theme that I don’t think Harris’s ad communicates very well), it was “whom do you trust to pick up the phone when there’s a world crisis at 3 a.m.?”
ameliatd: I agree that the “3 a.m.” echo was unfortunate. But I’m not sure how many people will remember specifically that it was a Clinton ad.
Harris’s ad was striking to me because she highlighted the fact that she was raised by a single mother. So it was kind of similar to some of the very personal, sometimes viral ads we saw in 2018, like the one where Stacey Abrams talked about growing up without health insurance and living in debt.
meredithconroy: Harris has ground to make up, too. Her launch ad was short — less than a minute — and not biographical. And for the lesser-known candidates in the primary, it’s important that their ads introduce themselves, which Harris’s “3 a.m.” ad does. It’s biographical and touching, but it also informs her broader agenda — so a successful ad, in my opinion.
ameliatd: But isn’t that the opposite of what Castro did? And IMHO that ad was quite good.
meredithconroy: That’s why talking about campaign ad strategies is tough. A lot depends on the candidate and the moment. Harris and Castro have different things they need to accomplish, at this point. Castro needs to make the debate stage. Harris needs to win over supporters who may be backing another front-runner.
nrakich: Yes, Amelia, Castro’s ad was outside the box — which is why I think it was good. It stands out.
But also, I don’t know if it’s fair to call it his introductory ad (even though he hasn’t aired any others on TV). It was more like a sneak preview, haha.
sarahf: I do wonder, though, if going after Trump is a good overall strategy for campaign ads. Or whether positive ads where a candidate introduces himself or herself to voters is a better move?
What does the research tell us?
ameliatd: I think sometimes people assume that negative ads are more effective — but that’s not necessarily the case. Political science research has shown that attack ads and positive ads trigger different emotions (no surprise there) and that those ads lead to different kinds of reactions. So I think it’s really more about a candidate’s strategy and which voters they want to appeal to — do they want to be seen as someone inspiring? Or someone who can really go after Trump? There isn’t really a one-size-fits-all approach.
meredithconroy: The stage of the campaign where candidates announce they’re running is mostly over, though, so that means we’ll be moving away from more positive ads that seek to inspire, and toward more negative ads. And strategy-wise, ads that are negative may actually be good because research shows they are more memorable. One way to identify if the ad will be inspiring or negative is to listen to the music — research has also found that music and imagery are used to induce specific emotional reactions.
ameliatd: Meredith is right — these ads are so primal. It’s all about emotion. There has been research showing that just swapping out the music and imagery can change people’s reactions to advertisements.
nrakich: Yes, totally. The music, the colors and the narrator’s tone can all tell you within the first couple seconds if an ad is going to be negative or not.
ameliatd: So much for substance!
Except, that’s not really true. Studies have also shown that ads are actually a pretty effective way to inform voters about policy.
Hearts and minds, guys.
meredithconroy: ❤️🧠
sarahf: It is true that a lot of attention will be devoted to TV ad buys and the markets that candidates spend the most money in. But one other question I have is how are digital ads on, say, Facebook and Google, changing the landscape? Who’s leading there?
meredithconroy: Tom Steyer is leading there, Sarah! Is he running the best digital ads? I’m not sure. But he’s certainly spending the most on digital ads.
ameliatd: Right, he’s spent $2.9 million on Facebook ads alone. Which makes sense — he got into the race really late, he’s got a lot of money at his disposal as a billionaire, and he’s been trying to qualify for the debates.
meredithconroy: And it might be paying off. As of today, he is polling at 7 percent in early primary states, according to Morning Consult.
nrakich: Yeah, the split in that poll between Steyer’s standing in early states (7 percent) and nationally (1 percent) is really interesting.
He is also spending a ton on TV ads in the early states — probably smartly, as it is easier to move up in the polls in just one state. Early-state polls count for debate qualification too. In fact, all three of his debate-qualifying polls so far are from early states, not national polls.
sarahf: And Steyer needs to hit 2 percent in just one more qualifying poll by next Wednesday to make the debate stage, so I’m sure that’s a big factor in many of his ad purchases.
Although, when it comes to ad-buying strategy, it doesn’t seem as if Steyer has one. He’s invested heavily in both TV ads and online ads. He’s spent $3.6 million on digital ads, according to Bully Pulpit’s 2020 Campaign Tracker, and an estimated $6.2 million on seven TV ad buys, according to an ABC News analysis.
But I am curious, what does digital ad spending enable Steyer and other candidates to do differently than traditional TV ad buys?
ameliatd: The thing that’s been most helpful about digital ads, at least so far, is that you can target who’s seeing them. This is kind of the opposite of TV ads, which are blunter instruments. For example, if you’re trying to get people to donate small amounts to your campaign, digital ads could be the way to go.
meredithconroy: Right, there has been a move toward targeted digital advertising — “the equivalent of switching from a hacksaw to a scalpel.” That is something that candidates weren’t spending money on until 2008.
nrakich: That’s certainly true, but I think a hacksaw suits Steyer just fine, for now. In fact, I would argue that Steyer’s TV ads in early states have been more important than his online spending.
ameliatd: What makes you say that, Nathaniel?
nrakich: Well, first of all, as Sarah mentioned, he has spent more than $6 million on TV ads, primarily in media markets that cover Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. That’s nearly twice as much as he has spent on digital ads.
Second, a plurality of Americans (49 percent) still get their news from television. And more Americans watch TV than are on Facebook. A full 97 percent of American households used a TV in 2015, while “only” 69 percent of Americans have a Facebook account, as of 2019.
meredithconroy: Yes, broadcast is still king/queen. But that will probably change, maybe even by the next presidential cycle. For instance, from 2014 to 2018, the share of political ads on TV dropped while digital advertising rose. However, this doesn’t mean that candidates won’t still spend more on broadcast than digital (at least right now).
ameliatd: For sure — candidates always spend a lot more on TV than on digital. But it’s been interesting to see how the debate rules appear to have affected some Democrats’ digital advertising, which means the focus might shift there, too.
sarahf: Yeah, let’s talk a bit about how the debate rules might be changing how candidates approach digital advertising. We don’t have any hard numbers on what percentage of ads bought online were used for fundraising purposes, but the small donor requirements for the first three debates has meant that candidates have had to step up advertising (largely online) to attract donors, right?
ameliatd: The Washington Post did an analysis of Facebook ad spending data in June that found that about a quarter of the campaigns’ ad spending was explicitly focused on the debates. That’s a lot.
meredithconroy: And after Steyer, Gillibrand has spent the most on Facebook ads among the Democratic field — $1.1 million. Gillbrand still hasn’t met either the donor or polling requirements to make the third debate, so she’s using Facebook (and Twitter) to solicit donations.
sarahf: What about a candidate like Elizabeth Warren, who has eschewed the traditional TV ad blitz for an online-first approach where her team produces many of their own ads? Is this the future of campaigns?
nrakich: I’m old enough to remember that digital ads were considered “the future of campaigns” back in the 2012 cycle, too. But it hasn’t happened yet.
I agree that they are an important part of any modern campaign ad plan. But I’m not sure they’ll keep growing ad infinitum to the point where they supplant TV.
ameliatd: Increasingly, I think it has to be a “both, and” strategy, right? Lots of Americans watch TV. But TV ads are expensive, and you can’t micro-target your ads to reach specific people. Not to mention, online ads certainly allow for more creativity — for one thing, they can be much longer than TV ads.
But in a lot of ways, politics is still pretty analog. An analysis of Democrats’ advertising in 2018 showed that direct-mail campaigns were still one of the biggest expenses.
meredithconroy: And don’t forget YARD SIGNS!!
sarahf: I don’t know. I think digital ads are going to play an important role here in 2020. After all, part of Trump’s 2016 mojo that he’d like to replicate in 2020 was the success he had with Facebook ads. He outpaced Hillary Clinton in digital ad spending in 2016 and is currently outpacing Democratic candidates in Facebook ad buys — he’s already spent $9.6 million there. So I think it’s possible to have a smart digital ad strategy.
ameliatd: My sense, also, is that Facebook ads are good for raising money. Probably also good for mobilizing/exciting voters.
Another thing working in Facebook’s favor is that if you have a bunch of small, cheap ads, you can do a lot of testing — see what works for different audiences. That’s not really something you can do with TV.
nrakich: There is also a belief in campaign world (whether it has hard evidence behind it, I dunno) that people are more likely to listen, and potentially be persuaded, if they are getting a campaign message from someone they know and trust. (For example, a friend or family member.)
This is one reason why I think Warren’s “selfie strategy” of spending hours after her rallies taking selfies with individual people is really smart. Because what happens to those selfies? People post them on their Facebook pages, and their friends get the implicit (or perhaps explicit, depending on the caption!) message that Jane Q. Voter endorses Warren. And I think that’s powerful stuff.
ameliatd: I think you’re right, Nathaniel. Warren has been smart about how she’s engaged with her supporters. For a while she was also calling donors personally to thank them, which people then posted about online.
But, that and the selfies take time.
nrakich: Yeah, but I’m open to the argument that they’re a good use of time.
meredithconroy: I am too.
nrakich: Plus, she doesn’t dial for dollars or go to high-dollar fundraising events, so this just takes the place of those staples of traditional campaigning.
ameliatd: I’m not saying it’s not a good use of her time! It’s just interesting to see candidates making these choices and trade-offs. The combination of a huge field + lots of ways to reach voters means that there’s a lot of experimentation. Which, to nerds like us, is cool.
sarahf: OK, so it’s early yet, and there are still many more ads we haven’t yet seen, but who, at this point, is running the best campaign ads? Or, if there isn’t one candidate who stands out to you, what approach to campaign ad buys do you think will be effective in 2020?
I, for one, am pretty convinced that Facebook ads will continue to play a big role (coupled with Google ad buys) just given the success Trump had in 2016. I also think that Biden’s ad strategy isn’t that bad. He’s running on the idea that he’s the only candidate who can defeat Trump and his ads (so far) have reinforced that idea — so he’s staying #onbrand, which when you’re running for president isn’t a bad thing.
nrakich: I think Steyer’s ad strategy has obviously been the most effective so far. He is the only candidate whose ads appear to have moved the polling needle. But that might be because he is the only candidate who has put real muscle behind his ad campaign, not because the ads are intrinsically good. I want to wait until other people’s ad campaigns get more robust.
And, of course, we have to see if Steyer is able to sustain his advertising pace. Getting a nice polling bump in August doesn’t matter if it fades by October.
ameliatd: Right, I’ve seen research showing that the effects of political ads wear off pretty quickly. So that’ll be an important question for Steyer moving forward. But which ads to run, and where, is also an increasingly high-stakes consideration for lower-tier candidates — if they’re spending a lot of money but still not breaking through, how can they get the most bang for their buck?
meredithconroy: Political science research does suggest that candidates do better in counties where they spend more than their opponents. So saturation is not a bad strategy, but Amelia’s right, the effects of ads decay over time.
But figuring out the best advertising strategy is complicated by the large Democratic field. We have a relatively new advertising landscape, with more platforms for content production, sharing and micro-targeting. So it is difficult for campaigns to know exactly what is working. But perhaps following Trump’s 2016 campaign, which experimented with its advertising strategy and by most accounts did so with success, Democrats may continue to experiment, while also still relying on more traditional forms of advertisements.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Elizabeth Warren’s campaign has stood out for making incremental but relatively steady gains. And along with a rise in her polling numbers, Warren has been getting more media attention.
Data from the TV News Archive shows that last week Warren was mentioned more often on cable news than she had been since at least April, when FiveThirtyEight began tracking the weekly number of cable news clips mentioning 2020 Demcoratic presidential hopefuls. (TV News Archive chops up cable news on the three networks we follow — CNN, Fox News and MSNBC — into 15-second clips.)1 And according to data from Media Cloud,2 a database of online news stories, Warren was the most-mentioned candidate in online news stories last week.

While Warren was mentioned in the greatest number of online news stories last week, she has only a narrow lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. All three were mentioned in about a third of the online news stories that mentioned any 2020 Democratic candidate, and have since late last month been mentioned in approximately the same percentage of stories. And despite her gains, Warren continues to trail Biden in cable news mentions.
Still, last week, Warren’s share of mentions rose and Biden’s fell across both mediums. That’s part of a larger trend for Biden. When he first declared his candidacy in April, Biden was consistently mentioned in more than 40 percent of all cable news clips that mentioned any Democratic candidate, but last week he was mentioned in about 32 percent — the smallest share since entering the race. And for the second time since Biden’s campaign launched, Biden dropped to the third most-mentioned candidate online while Warren led in online mentions.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-trump-drive-young-white-evangelicals-away-from-the-gop/,2019-08-19,,,features,"Aug. 20, 2019",Could Trump Drive Young White Evangelicals Away From The GOP?,Daniel Cox,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"A central message of President Trump’s insurgent candidacy in 2016 boiled down to this: Millions of Americans are losers — economically, culturally and even demographically. Perhaps no group needed less convincing of this proposition than white evangelical Christians, who have long felt embattled. “Make America Great Again” was the perfect slogan for Americans who had already embraced the notion that the country’s culture and way of life had been deteriorating since the 1950s. Indeed, white evangelical Christians voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton in large numbers, and Trump has maintained their support to an impressive degree.
But there are increasing signs of a generational rift: Younger white evangelicals have not fully bought into Trump’s politics and are less receptive to Trump’s message of cultural decline. The age gap among white evangelicals in some ways just mirrors the age gap among the public overall with regards to Trump, but in conversations with a number of younger white evangelical Christians, many said they are reexamining the way their faith informs their politics and whether the two have become too tightly intertwined.
If you drill to the center of Trump’s political base, a big chunk of those voters are white evangelical Christians. Evangelical leaders are among the first to defend him from criticism and the most ready to forgive his personal behavior. Roughly seven in 10 white evangelical Christians approve of the job Trump is doing as president, and many have been delighted by Trump’s first term.
Younger white evangelical Christians, however, express far less enthusiasm for Trump, even if they haven’t completely abandoned him. According to the 2019 Voter Study Group survey, only six in 10 younger white evangelical Christians (between the ages of 18 and 44) view Trump favorably, whereas 80 percent of those age 45 or older have a favorable opinion of the president. The intensity gap is even more pronounced. Only one-quarter (25 percent) of younger white evangelical Christians report having a “very favorable” opinion of Trump, compared to a majority (55 percent) of older white evangelicals.
No issue exemplifies Trump’s influence among white evangelical Christians — and highlights the emerging generational divide — more than immigration. From the start, Trump has made opposition to immigration a central part of his political identity. And white evangelical Christians rallied around Trump in the 2016 election and were quick to embrace his hard-line immigration agenda. During the campaign, white evangelical Christians expressed support for preventing Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. and temporarily banning Muslims from coming to the country. After the election, they coaleseced in support of building a wall along the southern border and blocking immigration from majority Muslim countries.
Indeed, Trump has managed to push the issue of immigration to the center of the evangelical agenda. Seventy-two percent of white evangelical Christians believe immigration should be a top priority, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.1 Five years ago, in 2014, that number was 49 percent.
But, again, the broad policy support masks a growing generational divide in views on immigrants. Two-thirds (66 percent) of young white evangelical Christians (age 18 to 34) say that immigrants coming to the U.S. strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents, a view shared by only 32 percent of white evangelical seniors (age 65+). A majority (54 percent) of older white evangelical Christians believe that immigrants are a burden on American society.
So why has Trump found younger white evangelicals harder to win over? Age has a lot to do with it. The president is profoundly unpopular among all young adults. A 2019 Harvard Institute of Politics survey finds that 70 percent of young adults (age 18 to 24) disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president.
But immigration in particular points to another reason young white evangelicals have been less receptive to Trump: Their lives have been dramatically different than their parents’.
Most white evangelical Christians say that the U.S. becoming a majority nonwhite country is a negative development. However, the younger white evangelical Christians I spoke to said the immigration debate is complicated. “Immigration is not as black-and-white as abortion,” said Lauren Burns, an evangelical student enrolled at Biola University.
First, the young evangelicals told me that demographic change doesn’t register as a “threat” to them. Like young Americans more generally, racial, ethnic and religious diversity is a normal part of their everyday life. In the U.S., only half of all evangelical Christians under 30 are white according to a 2016 study. On Christian college campuses, which have seen enrollment gains in recent years, young white evangelical Christians are part of an increasingly diverse student body. White students account for 62 percent of the student body on the roughly 140 campuses affiliated with the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, down from 82 percent in 1999.
And there are other reasons to think younger evangelicals would be less receptive to a message of America in decline. Anecdotally, at least, it seems young white evangelical Christians are less apt to believe their faith is in imminent danger from the broader culture.
In a recent interview with Newsweek, Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, argued that the “Make America Great Again” slogan never really resonated with younger white evangelicals. “Young evangelicals do not feel as if they are losing anything in terms of American culture,” he wrote. “They came of age at a time when following Christ seemed countercultural to them anyway. They never expected a nominally Christian culture in which being a church member would be the equivalent of being a good American.”
Indeed, young adults are upending many of the religious conventions and cultural assumptions that defined American public life in the past. Young people don’t feel particularly negatively toward atheists, nor do they view Islam as incompatible with American values. They don’t feel especially confident in religious leaders and they don’t see religious commitment as synonymous with virtue. The 2018 General Social Survey found that the majority of young adults say that people with strong religious beliefs are often intolerant of others. Even back in 2015, the overwhelming majority of young adults said they do not believe America is a Christian nation — one in five said it never was — and being Christian is not an important part of being American. The Christian consensus of previous generations, such as there was, is gone.
But critically, for young white evangelical Christians, this is the way it has always been. Numerically, they are already in the minority. Only 8 percent of adults under 30 are white evangelical Protestants. The segment of that age group that’s unaffiliated with any religion is nearly five times as large. Among Americans age 65 and older, white evangelicals account for more than one quarter of the population. Not surprisingly, young adults today are actually more likely to say they know an atheist than an evangelical. Growing up in Portland, Oregon, Burns’s group of friends in high school included people of color, gay and lesbian people, and atheists. “If I limited myself to only conservative white Christians, it would be pretty lonely,” she said.
Rather than yearning for the past, many young white evangelical Christians I spoke with have learned to navigate between an increasingly secular culture and their own deeply held religious commitments. Perhaps nothing defines the experience of young white evangelical Christians more than the conflict between their peers and their faith. Aaryn Marsters, who at the time of the interview was a 33-year-old evangelical Christian living in Charlotte, North Carolina, described the experience to The New York Times: “As evangelical young people become more liberal, older evangelicals think we’ve been brainwashed by the world. And as we continue to hold onto our faith and some more conservative or traditional values, many non-Christians believe we are still brainwashed from our upbringing.”
For many older white evangelical Christians, Trump’s vigorous public defense of conservative Christians remains the most compelling reason to support his reelection. At the Road to Majority Conference, an evangelical grassroots summit, for example, Faith and Freedom Coalition chairman Ralph Reed affirmed evangelicals’ unwavering commitment to President Trump. “There has never been anyone who has defended us and fought for us, who we have loved more than Donald J. Trump.” Jerry Fallwell Jr., head of Liberty University and a staunch Trump supporter, recently suggested that Christians needed to stop electing “nice guys” in favor of “street fighters” like Trump. Facing what they see as an increasingly hostile cultural climate, many older white evangelical Christians view Trump as their last and only option.
But this sentiment makes many younger evangelical Christians profoundly uncomfortable and strikes them as practically unnecessary. Aryana Petrosky, an evangelical and recent graduate from a nondenominational Christian school in California, worries about Christians aligning themselves with those in power. She also challenges the notion that conservative Christians need politicians to defend their beliefs in the public square. “We shouldn’t be looking to political leaders to defend our faith,” she said. It’s a view that is entirely consistent with the way younger white evangelicals understand politics. A 2017 Voter Study Group survey found that while nearly three-quarters of older white evangelical Christians agree that “politics is ultimately a struggle between good and evil,” younger white evangelicals are far more evenly divided on this issue.
So what about 2020? Few young white evangelical Christians who I’ve spoken with express enthusiasm about the coming election. For most, Trump is not their preferred candidate, but an increasingly secular and liberal Democratic Party does not present an attractive alternative. Given evangelicals’ strong pro-life commitment, the Democrats’ vocal support for abortion access makes the possibility of defection even less likely.
At this stage, a couple of predictions are easy. White evangelical Christians will strongly back Trump’s reelection bid, following a decades-old pattern, while young adults will rally to the Democratic nominee, as they have done in every presidential election since 2004. In a two-way contest, Trump is still likely to make off with the majority of young white evangelical votes. A tepid vote counts just as much as an enthusiastic one. Yet Trump is redefining the relationship young evangelical Christians have with the Republican Party. The long-term implications for our politics and evangelical Christianity could be profound.
Kate Stewart was raised in a very civically minded family and had been excited about the prospect of voting in the 2016 election long before her 18th birthday. But she became dismayed and disillusioned by her options. “Having to choose between these lesser of two evils was really disheartening,” she said. Looking ahead to 2020, Stewart for the first time in her voting life has started to look at candidates outside the Republican Party. “I’m cautiously optimistic that the evangelical vote, or at least my evangelical vote, might find a home outside the party of Donald Trump.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-6.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/take-this-cheat-sheet-to-the-ballpark-to-decide-when-to-leave/,2019-08-16,,,features,"Jul. 30, 2018",When Is It Safe To Leave A Baseball Game?,Kaiser Fung,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"Baseball is probably the one major sporting event where there is no shame1 in leaving a little early. For starters, the games typically range from long to comically long. The average nine-inning Major League Baseball game in 2017 took three hours and five minutes, setting an all-time record. With a new rule to limit mound visits, the average 2018 game is hovering at an even three hours, which is still longer than “The Godfather” start to finish and would tie for the third longest mark in history.
And unlike the current marathon affairs in college football, baseball is not exactly packing the extra minutes with scoring and excitement — unless pitchers jogging in from the bullpen is exciting to you. Plus, the stakes are low. They play 162 of these things. Add it all up and you understand why lines of fans hit the exits to beat the traffic home.
Of course, as any purist will tell you, a fan who leaves a ballpark early risks missing out on heart-pumping late-inning action: Just ask the owner of the car whose taillights were visible just outside Dodger Stadium as Kirk Gibson’s walk-off homer to win Game 1 of the 1988 World Series landed in the right-field stands.
We can’t advocate ever leaving early from the World Series.2 But at an average, middle-of-the-season, low-stakes game, exceptions can be made. The decision of when to exit is delicate: You want to leave games in which the outcomes are more or less predictable given the current score, but you don’t want to miss out on late-inning heroics. This decision is the kind of problem that data scientists are equipped to solve.
Our analysis is inspired by research into sequential decision-making problems initiated by Columbia University statistician Abraham Wald in the 1940s. Wald described a problem of accepting or rejecting a shipment of products based on sequentially inspecting random samples from the lot. After each sample is examined, the inspector can accept the shipment, reject it or defer the decision until after the next sample. Wald’s sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) establishes upper and lower bounds for the “likelihood” ratio computed from the current set of samples. If the ratio does not breach either bound, the inspector continues to request new samples. Whenever the ratio crosses one of the two bounds, the inspector makes the corresponding decision to accept or reject the lot.
For our purposes, we regard each inning as a new sample. After each inning, we inspect the run differential to decide whether to leave the stadium or stay for the next inning. The decision depends on the magnitude, but not the direction, of the lead. When the game is effectively over, we wish to disappear before the roads clog up. For this reason, our adapted SPRT involves only a lower bound on the run differential.

According to our statistical model, based on 2010-2015 regular season inning-by-inning scoring data,3 you should leave after the sixth inning if the leading team is ahead by four or more runs. There is a less than 5 percent chance that the other team will deliver a miracle comeback. If the run differential exceeds two at the top of the ninth, it’s safe to head to the exits. What about blowouts in the first inning? If your time is that precious — and you’re willing to view the money spent on tickets as a sunk cost — our advice is to rev up your car’s engine if the leading team jumps ahead by six runs or more.
In developing the cheat sheet, we tolerate a 5 percent false positive error rate. Take the 2016 season as an example. The impatient fan who took our advice would have left early in 1,750 games, but in 61 of those games, the eventual winner came from behind to win, and so the fan missed out on some later-inning excitement. For that season, our model attained an accuracy rate of 97 percent.
If you follow our cheat sheet, you will leave early in about eight of 10 baseball games. Typically, the best times to leave are between the bottom of the fifth inning and the top of the ninth inning. A back-of-the-envelope estimate pegs the total amount of time saved at 1,612 hours for the season. The price to pay was the 61 mistakes — dramatic comebacks that were heard on the radio from the parking lot by the fans who left early.

Poll of the week
After the deadly mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, this month, more Americans now describe white nationalism as a serious threat to the United States, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. Compared to the last time the poll asked this question, in March, both Democrats and Republicans in the latest poll were more likely to say that the country was threatened by white nationalism.1
But the El Paso shooting, in which the gunman told police that he explicitly targeted Mexicans, has not narrowed the partisan gap on white nationalism. HuffPost/YouGov polls have asked about the threat of white nationalism four times in the two years since a neo-Nazi killed a woman by driving into a crowd of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and each time there has been a huge partisan gap in perceptions. If anything, the gap has gotten bigger:
Democrats have long been more likely than Republicans to say that white nationalism is a “somewhat” or “very” serious threat. But the gap has expanded from 33 points right after Charlottesville to 52 points now. (Though the gap was slightly larger this spring, so the El Paso shooting seems have narrowed the gap a bit.)
Not surprisingly, that partisan gap also shows up in how Americans view President Trump’s relationship with white nationalism. According to the most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, 77 percent of Democrats think Trump supports the ideology, but only 10 percent of Republicans agree. Democratic politicians, including many of the 2020 contenders, have called the preseident a “white nationalist” and a “white supremacist,” and have been outspoken in saying that Trump’s rhetoric incites violence.
Trump has dismissed these attacks as being motivated by political gain. In a public statement after the El Paso shooting, Trump said that the nation must condemn “racism, bigotry, and white supremacy,” but an analysis of the document the shooter wrote explaining his actions found that it used many of the same anti-immigrant phrases that Trump has used in the past. And as my colleague Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux reported last week, experts say that racist rhetoric can make people more likely to act on their preexisting prejudices.
Indeed, polls show that the public is concerned about the effects of inflammatory political rhetoric. According to a survey from the Pew Research Center conducted in May — prior to the El Paso attack — large majorities of both Democrats and Republicans said that when elected officials use “heated or aggressive language” to talk about certain people or groups, it makes violence against those people more likely. A majority of respondents from both parties also agreed that politicians should avoid “heated language” because they think it could encourage violence.
But while there seems to be consensus around the idea that heated rhetoric is dangerous in the abstract, partisans don’t agree on where that rhetoric is coming from. The August HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 73 percent of Democrats say Trump’s rhetoric encourages his supporters to act violently, but 64 percent of Republicans feel the same way about the rhetoric of Democratic politicians.
Other polling bites
On Monday, Trump announced a new regulation that would deny permanent legal status to immigrants who are deemed likely to use government benefit programs like those that subsidize the cost of people’s housing and groceries. According to a YouGov poll conducted after the policy’s announcement, 28 percent of Americans, including 11 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of Republicans, agreed that immigrants who use public benefits should not be able to receive green cards. Fifty-two percent of Americans think that immigrants who receive benefits should be able to get green cards, and 20 percent said they don’t know.
According to a new Gallup poll, 57 percent of Americans (including 85 percent of Democrats and 24 percent of Republicans) support allowing refugees who are fleeing Central American countries to enter the U.S. That’s up 6 percentage points from December, including a 10 percentage point jump among Republicans.
A poll from the Pew Research Center, however, found that public support for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria is down slightly, from 77 percent in March 2017 to 72 percent this summer. That’s mostly due to dipping support among Republicans.
Vermonters are more likely than people from any other state to say that abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and Louisianans are least likely. That’s according to a new survey from the Public Religion Research Institute that combined telephone interviews from over 40,000 respondents between January and December of 2018, allowing for unusually detailed demographic crosstabs of variables like state of residence and religious affiliation.
60 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of China, according to a Pew Research Center poll. That’s the highest share Pew has recorded since 2005, when it began asking the question.
Only 15 percent of Americans would be willing to try deep-fried soda, and just 16 percent would be willing to try deep-fried butter, per a YouGov poll about food that Americans might encounter at a state or county fair. The poll also found that corn dogs are America’s favorite food served on a stick.
Tunisians will go to the polls next month to elect a new president after the recent death of Béji Caïd Essebsi, the nation’s first democratically elected president since the Arab Uprisings began there in late 2010. There are two polls from June and July that show Nabil Karoui, a media magnate who has been accused of money laundering, in the lead, but the surveys were conducted before Essebsi’s death. Because the president died before the end of his term, the country’s elections authority moved the presidential election from November up to September, meaning it will now take place before the October parliamentary vote, which significantly muddies the electoral picture. Karoui will appear alongside 25 other candidates on the ballot.
Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 42.2 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.4 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -11.2 points). At this time last week, 42.1 percent approved and 53.2 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -11.1 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 42.4 percent and a disapproval rating of 52.7 percent, for a net approval rating of -10.3 points.
Generic ballot
In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.2 percentage points (46.1 percent to 39.9 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 6.2 points (46.1 percent to 39.9 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.4 points (46.3 percent to 39.9 percent).

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sorry-running-backs-even-your-receiving-value-can-be-easily-replaced/,2019-08-16,,,features,"Aug. 16, 2019","Sorry, Running Backs. Even Your Receiving Value Can Be Easily Replaced.",Michael Salfino,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"Running backs in the NFL don’t have the value they once did. The five highest-paid running backs this season will make 93 percent of what the five highest-paid RBs were paid in 2011, based on their collective salary cap charges each year according to Spotrac. The five highest-paid quarterbacks of 2019, meanwhile, are making 185 percent of their 2011 counterparts.1
But top backs like Le’Veon Bell, who sat out the entire 2018 season over a contract dispute with the Steelers, and current holdout Ezekiel Elliott, who hauled in 77 passes last year, may be hoping to reestablish value at the position with their receiving ability. By leaning into a more pass-happy league, running backs like these two, the Panthers’ Christian McCaffrey (107 receptions in 2018) and the No. 2 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, the New York Giants’ Saquon Barkley (91 receptions), are leading a receiving revolution at the position.
But despite the exploits of the most prolific receiving backs last year, running back targets as a share of all passes are not significantly increasing. Teams are just throwing to everyone more often. Last year, 20.2 percent of passes were targeted at running backs, which is in line with the 2001-to-2017 average of 19.5 percent. The same is true if we look at the market share of passing yards: 18 percent last year compared with 17.5 from 2001 to 2017.
And unless you’re playing fantasy football, judging receiving ability by the number of catches and receiving yards is a poor way to measure this skill. A checkdown to a running back who gains 12 yards on third-and-15 is great for your fantasy team, but it doesn’t do much to improve an actual team’s chances of winning a game.
A more accurate — but still imperfect — gauge of the receiving value of a running back is the added value of the plays in which he is a receiver.2 We can use a team’s success rate on those plays — whether the play resulted in positive expected points added — to see more clearly that not all running back catches and yards are created equal.
Last year, NFL backs registered successful plays on 1,663 of 3,572 receiving targets, a rate of 46.6 percent, according to ESPN Stats & Information Group. Elliott and Barkley were the top two rushers in the league last season, but they were below-average receivers for their position by this metric, posting respective success rates of 36.1 and 40.3 percent on passes thrown to them. The Cowboys and Giants ranked 31st and 26th, respectively, in overall success rates on those plays. When their quarterbacks threw to Elliott and Barkley, they typically weren’t increasing their probability of scoring points — they were worsening it.
Whether it’s scheme, blocking or the ability of the running backs themselves, some teams are just better at this play-call than others. Comparing overall success rates, we can see a wide range of effectiveness across the league in 2018 when throwing to the RBs.

No team threw to its RBs more than the Patriots, and it obviously worked out OK for them. But that doesn’t mean the Patriots were the best at it — that honor belongs to the AFC runner-up Kansas City Chiefs, who recorded a success rate of 62.6 percent on these throws. The next best team on passes to running backs, the Panthers, posted a success rate of 54.5 percent. In fact, the difference in success rate, 8.1 percentage points, between the best and second-most effective teams — the Chiefs and Panthers — is the same as the difference between the Panthers and the Packers, the 15th-best team at this play.
Despite their high proficiency on such throws, the Chiefs were just 23rd in the share of passes targeted to running backs, though it’s hard to criticize them for not throwing enough to RBs given that they had one of the most explosive offenses in NFL history. And the Chiefs didn’t rely on any one running back for that success: Targets to each of the Chiefs’ primary backs last season — Kareem Hunt, Spencer Ware and Damien Williams — had a success rate of at least 59.5 percent.
This raises a problem for the star running backs trying to prove their worth this season. Because the expected points added on a given play are owned by everyone involved, it would be hard for a running back to claim success rate on targets as his own.
For example, Melvin Gordon is holding out from the Chargers for a new contract — one that would pay him for being more than just a runner. He would reasonably be able to point to the 50.8 percent play success on his 61 targets in 2018. The trouble is that the other top Charger backs, Austin Ekeler and Justin Jackson, were each part of a higher share of successful pass plays than Gordon was, averaging a success rate of 54.2 percent.
Standing out as receivers may be the best chance for running backs trying to get around the depressed salaries at their position. But even with their contributions to the passing game, it still might be a challenge for these RBs to prove that their receiving value also isn’t easily replaced.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tight-ends-are-killing-it-lately-but-are-they-as-important-as-they-used-to-be/,2019-08-16,,,features,"Aug. 16, 2019",Are Tight Ends As Valuable As They Used To Be?,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"Five years ago, I surveyed the many changes brought to the tight end position during the era of Tony Gonzalez and Antonio Gates, whose parallel ascents to the top of the historical rankings mirrored the game’s turn toward more receiver-like talents in the role. During the 15 NFL seasons from 1999 to 2013, either Gonzalez or Gates finished among the top five in tight-end receiving yardage every single year.1 During that same span, the share of league receiving yards going to tight ends increased dramatically, from 12 percent to 21 percent.
It was a tight end revolution. But by now, the primary instigators have moved on. Gates is sort of still around — maybe — but Gonzalez retired after the 2013 season. And Rob Gronkowski, the greatest tight end of the era after the primes of Gonzalez and Gates, hung up his spikes in March. In their place, new statistical monsters have emerged. In fact, 2018 saw both of the two greatest yardage seasons by tight ends in NFL history:

After producing an eye-popping 2,713 yards between them, George Kittle of the San Francisco 49ers and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs are clearly the new standard-bearers for the superstar tight end. So is this the start of another Gonzalez/Gates-style dynasty at the position? Or something different entirely? And might they be joined by even more elite tight ends in 2019?
There’s no question that the stat above — a record-breaking double for single-season yardage — grabs your attention right away. But it doesn’t necessarily follow that Kittle and Kelce had the two most valuable tight end seasons of all time last year. According to Football Outsiders’ Defense-adjusted Yards Above Replacement metric, which measures a player’s production in terms of how much it adds to the team’s chances of scoring on any given drive (and adjusts for strength of schedule and era), Kittle was only the 44th-best single-season performer at the position since 1986, their earliest season of data. And instead of being the second-best all-time, Kelce ranks 60th, while Philadelphia’s Zach Ertz, who last year posted the 11th-best season for a tight end since 1986 in terms of yardage, ranks just 282nd in DYAR.

DVOA is Football Outsiders’ measure of per-play efficiency, scaled as a percentage relative to average. It is used to generate DYAR, which measures total value relative to a backup-level player.
Advanced metrics are only reported for 1986 and later.

While the best yardage seasons by Gronkowski, Gonzalez and Gates ranked among the most valuable since 1986 according to DYAR — thanks in large part to enormous per-play efficiency (as measured by Defense-adjusted Value Over Average, Football Outsiders’ rate-stat answer to DYAR) — Kittle and Kelce were less efficient in their monster seasons. This is true relative to other tight ends but also just in the sense that all passes to a tight end are less efficient now than they used to be, both compared with the average pass and (especially) relative to the average offensive play.
From 2006 (the first season of ESPN’s expected points added data) through 2011, the average pass attempt to a tight end added about 18 percent more EPA per play than the overall average for all passes. Since 2012, the average tight end target has been worth only 14 percent more EPA than an average pass to any position. At the same time, passes make up a larger share of offensive plays than in the past,2 which only further reduces the edge in effectiveness that a tight end target has relative to the average NFL offensive play.
Simply put, it’s harder to stand out as a great tight end these days. Gonzalez and Gates used to excel by creating mismatches, forcing defenses to choose between committing undersized defensive backs against their towering frames or using slower linebackers in coverage against their speed. But defenses have adapted by emphasizing quicker linebackers and developing hybrid safeties who can defend the run while still keeping stride with receiving tight ends. At the same time, tight end prospects are emphasizing pass-catching skills more than other aspects of the job, creating a whole league full of quasi-receivers at the position.
You can see this trend in how tight ends are being deployed. Only 44 percent of total receiving yards went to tight ends who lined up from the traditional tight end spot at the end of the offensive line (including playoffs). Kelce picked up 906 yards from lining up as an oversized slot receiver, and 41 percent of overall tight end receiving yardage was gained that way in 2018. Kelce also hauled in 240 more yards — best in the league among TEs — while split out wide, from where about 13 percent of all tight end yardage was accrued. (That’s nearly double what the share was at the beginning of the decade.)
Perhaps the balance of all these changes explains why, after massive gains in the share of receiving yardage filtered to tight ends between the 1990s and early 2010s, that number has stagnated in recent seasons, fluctuating between 19 and 20 percent each year since 2013. Tight ends are still among the most efficient options on the field, but teams might be maxing out just how much of a receiving load they can ask the position to carry. Ertz set a new tight end record last season with 156 targets; Kelce (150) and Kittle (136) weren’t far behind.
The next tight end to join them atop the yardage (and workload) list might be O.J. Howard of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who ranked third in DYAR behind Kittle and Kelce last season despite being targeted for a third as many passes. Howard had a league-leading DVOA of +44 percent in 2018, and he actually ranked ahead of Kelce in ProFootballFocus’s metrics because of superior blocking grades. Howard seems due for a greater role in Tampa’s offense than before, though, and if his elite TE peers are any indication, that might mean a big dip in efficiency. Then again, Howard also embodies the kind of deep-threat mismatch a modern tight end is increasingly required to be, with an average depth of 11.47 air yards per target last season, which ranked second only to Gronkowski.3
Either way, despite the record-setting numbers, Kittle and Kelce aren’t necessarily better than their TE predecessors — just different. And they might have company at the top soon. But if today’s top tight ends are less dominant relative to league average than in the heyday of Gonzalez and Gates, it might just be because the whole position has gotten better and is being asked to do a lot more, while defenses are more geared to stop them than ever.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

2 degrees Celsius
The average temperature of New Jersey has climbed nearly 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) since 1895, double the average rise of the rest of the continental United States. That number — 2 degrees — “has emerged as a critical threshold for global warming” and indeed the signatories to the 2015 Paris accord agreed that urgent action was needed to keep warming “well below” that level. But along with New Jersey, an analysis of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature data reveals that 71 counties have already crossed the 2-degree mark. [The Washington Post]
60 percent
Amid President Trump’s trade war, Americans’ views of China have become historically unfavorable. Sixty percent now say they have an unfavorable view of the country, up from 47 percent last year and the highest level recorded since Pew began asking in 2005 (when unfavorable views of China were 35 percent). [Pew Research Center]
0 percent
At the Iowa State Fair, they administer a decidedly nonscientific poll whereby fairgoers drop a corn kernel into a jar corresponding to their preferred presidential candidate. In this decidedly nonscientific poll, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio registered 0 percent. For whatever it’s worth, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg led the way with 24, 16 and 16 percent of the corn, respectively. [WHO TV]
8 home runs
Aristides “The Punisher” Aquino, the Cincinnati Reds’ 25-year-old rookie outfielder, has been doing little lately but hitting home runs. He hit eight of them in his first 12 games, a Major League Baseball record. All eight came in his past nine games (as of Tuesday afternoon), and he homered seven times in his past six games, tying the MLB record for rookies. [Deadspin]
700 million tweets
There have been 700 million tweets sent thus far this year related to video games, a 30 percent increase year-over-year. Recently, the increase prevalence of games on the social network has been driven by a backlash to the blame misplaced on games following mass shootings, and by big e-sports events such as the Fortnite World Cup and EVO 2019. [The Hollywood Reporter]
300 miles away
Following wildfires there last month, rare lightning has also recently struck the Arctic. Thunderstorms require air that’s, like, warm. Yet multiple lightning strikes were detected “within 300 miles of the North Pole,” according to the National Weather Service. “This is one of the furthest north lightning strikes in Alaska forecaster memory,” the NWS said.

Of course, part of what made 2016 so complicated was there were just so many Republicans running — 17 at one point. In addition to Trump’s surge in the polls, Republican Party elites failed to coalesce around one candidate as an alternative to Trump. Many GOP leaders took a wait-and-see approach, which led to a relatively low number of endorsements before the first primary contests in February 2016. So we were curious about what, if anything, the 2016 Republican primary can tell us about the 2020 Democratic race, which has even more candidates running. Do endorsements just work differently in a crowded primary?
We looked at endorsements made by senators, representatives and governors in the 2016 and 2020 cycles,1 and so far Democratic Party elites have been more likely to endorse candidates than Republicans in 2016. But a deeper dive into the data suggests that a spat of early endorsements accounts for much of the difference. It’s possible that, once again, endorsements may prove to be a less useful indicator when predicting who might win the nomination.
The chart below displays the total number of endorsements made by Republican governors and members of Congress in the 2016 cycle and the total number of endorsements made by Democratic governors and congresspeople through August 13. So far, 26 percent of Democrats have endorsed a candidate compared to 17 percent of Republicans who had made an endorsement at the same point in the 2016 cycle. And it’s worth noting that there were actually more possible Republican endorsers — 333 — than there are Democratic endorsers — 304.2
But as we said earlier, much of the difference is due to an endorsement-laden February 2019,3 when 30 Democratic members of Congress or governors backed a candidate. This was driven primarily by endorsements for Sen. Cory Booker, who received backing from 13 New Jersey Democrats — the governor, its other senator and all 11 Democratic representatives. To put February in context, the second-most active month in 2019 was April (12 endorsements, 10 of which went to former Vice President Joe Biden around the time of his campaign announcement), and the busiest Republican month in 2015 was November (16 endorsements, 10 of which went to Sen. Marco Rubio). And outside of February, the rate of endorsements in 2019 hasn’t been all that different from 2015, so it’s possible that Democrats may be as slow to endorse as Republicans were last time.
Looking back at the 2016 cycle, the number of GOP endorsements didn’t really balloon either until February 2016, when the first four primary contests occurred. During that month, 56 Republican senators, representatives and governors endorsed or switched their endorsements.4 And Trump only got his first endorsement from a member of Congress or governor on Feb. 24, one day after he won the Nevada caucuses and four days after winning the South Carolina primary. It wasn’t until late March that more than 50 percent of Republicans had endorsed a presidential candidate.
To better understand what happened in 2016 and how we might expect endorsements to work in another crowded primary field, I spoke with political scientists Hans Noel and David Karol, two of the authors of “The Party Decides.” For Noel, one notable thing about 2016 is how few Republicans endorsed. “I think the real story there was that they didn’t know who they were supposed to endorse. They didn’t like Trump but didn’t know who to stop him with, and then there were various reasons why they couldn’t coordinate there,” he said.

And as Karol pointed out, it wasn’t just the size of the candidate field: it was also a question of which contenders presented the leading alternative to Trump. Candidates such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Ted Cruz and then-Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin all had hang-ups that made it difficult for Republican leaders to rally around them. Bush, for instance, had raised a lot of money, but had limited appeal to the GOP base; Cruz was polarizing within the GOP establishment; and Walker’s early strength proved fleeting, as his campaign flatlined after Trump got into the race. “So without a consensus candidate, many Republicans waited to see how things developed rather than endorse,” Karol said. Both Karol and Noel reiterated that endorsements are most telling if one candidate is dominating them, which wasn’t the case in the 2016 GOP race and hasn’t happened so far in the 2020 Democratic primary.
When party leaders stay out or support a range of candidates, the nomination race tends to be wide open. And while, according to Karol, some of the leading Democratic contenders may have an easier time being accepted by different factions of the party than, say, Bush or Cruz in 2016, signs still point to an unpredictable contest. Part of that is probably a byproduct of 2016, when party leaders overwhelmingly backed Clinton — a move some later perceived as an error after Trump won. “A similar thing, I think, is happening now where Democrats are backing some folks but they’re not quite sure which of the several good choices can really pop up to the top, and they’re willing to wait,” Noel said. And given how crowded the Democratic field is, it may be several more months before we see another spate of endorsements.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

24,600 per liter
New research out of Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research has shed further light on the abundance of microplastic pollution and how it is carried around the globe by the wind. The particles then settle in snow and ice, which the researchers tested, finding 24,600 per liter on average in European locations. This adds to a growing body of such work — an earlier study found that we eat some 50,000 microplastic particles a year. [The Guardian]
$12,049 in traffic fines
A computer hacker in California secured for himself as a cheeky joke the vanity license plate “NULL,” a word often used in programing to indicate an empty or undefined value. As a result, he at one point faced $12,049 in traffic fines. Whenever a traffic cop in the state forgot to enter a license plate number along with a citation, it seems, the ticket got sent the hacker’s way. [Wired]
$690 million lost
WeWork, an, uh, office rental company, states its mission as “to elevate the world’s consciousness.” The company has lost $2.9 billion in the past three years and $690 million in the first half of this year. Undeterred, WeWork has been aiming for a $3.5 billion IPO, and to raise billions more in debt, the former of which would be the second-biggest IPO of the year behind Uber’s. [Bloomberg]
90,000 signatures
More than 90,000 people have signed an online petition to rename Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets in New York City. If successful, the address of Trump Tower would become 725 President Barack H. Obama Avenue, New York, NY 10022. The entreaty fails to meet a street-renaming requirement that the honoree be dead, but the petitioners, one of whom started the project as a joke, hope that an exception can be made. [USA Today]
170 pounds
It’s been a big month for big birds. First came Squawkzilla, and now, in New Zealand, scientists have discovered a “monster” penguin that lived some 60 million years ago. Not only is Crossvallia waiparensis the oldest known penguin species, but it stood more than 5 feet tall and weighed more than 170 pounds. [NBC News]
50 households
Mysterious men in Henrico County, Virginia, wearing old televisions on their heads, have visited more than 50 households recently under dark of night, depositing on each doorstep … another old television. The same thing happened in the same county this time last year, though there were reportedly fewer televisions. A local police lieutenant declined to discuss the department’s theories.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-think-economic-inequality-is-a-problem-just-not-the-most-pressing-one/,2019-08-15,,,features,"Aug. 16, 2019",Many Americans Think Economic Inequality Is A Problem — Just Not The Most Pressing One,Erin Doherty,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"“Grotesque” is how Sen. Bernie Sanders has described the level of wealth inequality in the U.S., and he’s not the only Democrat running a presidential campaign that relies heavily on this idea. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has called the economy “rigged.” And Sen. Cory Booker has said, “We can no longer accept racial and economic disparity as a normal function of our society.”
But while Americans are aligned with Democrats on some economic issues, like raising taxes on the wealthy, most don’t view economic inequality as the most pressing issue facing the nation today, which means that making closing the gap between rich and poor the focal point of a presidential campaign might not woo voters.
According to a July poll from Gallup, when asked an open-ended question about the most important problem facing the country, just 2 percent of Americans mentioned the “gap between rich and poor,” and this number hasn’t changed much in over a decade, hovering around 2 or 3 percent. (It’s worth noting that since respondents had to come up with their own answers, even 3 percent support means a sizable number of people mentioned this issue without any prompting.) By contrast, Americans’ views of the importance of the economy have tended to fluctuate with the economy’s performance, as you can see in the chart below — in November 2008, for instance, when the country was in the middle of a recession, 58 percent of Americans mentioned the economy as the most important issue facing the country, whereas today, in a relatively good economy, just 3 percent of Americans said the same.
As for why more Americans aren’t prioritizing socioeconomic inequality, Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told me he thinks that people don’t necessarily think about how their economic situation compares to other people’s, especially when the economy is good. “If I’ve got a job and my friends all have jobs, I think I’m doing OK and I’m not worried so much about how I’m doing relative to Warren Buffett.”
There is also evidence that Americans remain optimistic about the potential for upward socioeconomic mobility in the U.S., which could be another reason they’re less concerned about inequality than other issues. For instance, another Gallup poll from late June found that seven out of 10 Americans believed that if they work hard, they can still achieve the “American Dream.” That number is roughly unchanged from 2009. In that same poll, 60 percent of Americans also said it’s either “somewhat” or “very” likely that today’s young people will have better lives than their parents, which is close to the highest that number Gallup has recorded (it got as high as 61 percent in both 2008 and 2018).
Although Americans say socioeconomic inequality isn’t their top priority, many of them support at least one measure that would help close the gap: taxing the wealthy. Many 2020 Democratic candidates have expressed some level of support for raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, though the details of their plans vary. If candidates tie their messages of socioeconomic inequality to their plans to tax the rich, that approach could appeal to voters.
According to Gallup, a majority of Americans — a bit over 60 percent — say that upper-income people pay too little in taxes, and that percentage has remained relatively unchanged over the last 25 years. And polling on specific proposals that hike the tax rate for the wealthy shows that these ideas get support from most Democrats and many Republicans. For instance, earlier this year, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed a 70 percent tax rate on every dollar a person earned over $10 million, and a majority of registered voters supported the idea. The proposal got significant support across the political spectrum, with 71 percent of Democrats, 60 percent of independents and 45 percent of Republicans saying they were in favor.
But Gleckman cautioned me that the public’s support for taxing the wealthy may have less to do with concerns over income inequality and more to do with ensuring the wealthy are not unfairly benefiting from the economy. “It’s an issue of [the wealthy] getting away with something because they know how to game the system,” Gleckman said. He added that Warren in particular is tapping into this mentality and trying to play on “that feeling that the tax system just isn’t fair and that I gotta pay taxes on everything I owe, so those rich guys and corporations ought to pay taxes on everything they owe too.”
So for Democrats looking to capture voters’ attention in 2020, rhetoric about closing the gap between the rich and the poor might serve them better as a supporting element rather than the focal point of their campaigns. As for proposals to tax the wealthy, however, candidates might want to keep those front and center — those ideas could be a winning political argument.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-bidens-opponents-being-too-coy-in-making-age-an-issue/,2019-08-15,,,features,"Aug. 15, 2019",Voters Care About Biden’s Age — Not About His Gaffes,Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"After a week’s worth of media focus on a series of gaffes and misstatements by former Vice President Joe Biden, Democratic voters are reacting by … apparently not giving much of a damn.
Granted, there hasn’t been a ton of polling this week. But what data we have looks just fine for Biden. His position in Morning Consult’s weekly tracking poll — first place with 33 percent of the vote — is unchanged. In HarrisX’s tracking poll for ScottRasmussen.com, he’s at 28 percent, which is up 3 percentage points from a week ago. He’s down 1 point in YouGov’s weekly poll, and he did get some middling numbers in New Hampshire this week. But Biden also got a good poll in South Carolina.
Not that you should necessarily have expected any differently. Biden has survived more serious problems — a rough first debate, a group of allegations about inappropriately touching women — only to see his numbers rebound from any decline (if they were even affected in the first place). So it probably would have been optimistic for Biden’s rivals to expect a handful of verbal gaffes to move his polls, especially given that Biden already came into the campaign with a reputation for being gaffe-prone.
Some influential Democrats are focusing on those gaffes for another reason, though: They see them as a sign of Biden’s advancing age. (Biden is 76 and would be 78 upon assuming the presidency.) Whether those Democrats are genuinely concerned about Biden’s age insofar as it might affect his performance against President Trump, or whether they’re using it as an excuse to promote the candidacies of younger Democrats who they happen to like better anyway, undoubtedly varies from case to case.
A lot of rank-and-file voters do have concerns about Biden’s age. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in February found that 62 percent of voters had reservations about voting for someone aged 75 or older. Other polls have also shown advanced age to be a concern among Democrats, Republicans and independents alike.
But there hasn’t been much discussion of age from the other candidates. Eric Swalwell brought it up explicitly in the first presidential debate, when he urged voters to “pass the torch to a new generation of Americans.” Rather than echo Swalwell’s argument, however, Kamala Harris tried to defuse the situation by suggesting that discussions of age and generational change were tantamount to schoolyard insults. “America does not want to witness a food fight, they want to know how we are going to put food on their table,” she said.
Maybe anti-Biden Democrats — and the other candidates — think they’re being coy by using Biden’s gaffes as a proxy for concerns about his age. No reason to get tarred with allegations of ageism, they figure, or to risk offending older voters who turn out in big numbers in the primaries. (Also, if the candidate they prefer to Biden is Bernie Sanders, they have the further problem that Sanders is a year older than Biden at 77.)1 Show rather than tell, as the maxim goes: Plant a few seeds and let voters build a narrative about Biden’s age on their own, without having to give them the hard sell.
This strategy might even work! It’s still fairly early, and Biden’s age is perhaps his biggest risk factor — bigger, in my view, than his policy positions, which are often more in line with the views of the average Democrat than those of the more liberal candidates.
But especially in the era of Trump — who, of course, has already begun to question Biden’s mental fitness — there might also be something to be said for saying the quiet part out loud. In a poll conducted shortly after the first debate, some Democratic voters explicitly used Swalwell’s “pass the torch” language when asked an open-ended question about why they didn’t want to vote for Biden. And they were much more likely to explicitly mention Biden’s age than to use vaguer responses, such as that he was “out of touch.”
There’s also risk to anti-Biden Democrats in drawing voters’ attention to gaffes or other incidents that voters view as relatively minor. Biden remains an extremely well-liked figure among Democratic voters; 75 percent of them have a favorable view of him, according to Morning Consult’s latest polling. So three-quarters of the electorate is going to start with a predilection against sympathizing with critiques of Biden. If those critiques aren’t really bringing the goods and instead seem like petty grievances, those Democrats may conclude that the case against Biden is a lot of hot air.

Meanwhile, if the false alarms continue — as in, Democrats on Twitter or on podcasts predict Biden’s demise and the polls are unmoved — the media may come to view Biden as a Trump-like “Teflon” candidate who isn’t greatly affected by gaffes and scandals. That could reduce their appetite for covering them in the future — even if more serious ones occur than what’s taken place to date.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-we-sure-aaron-rodgers-is-still-an-elite-quarterback/,2019-08-15,,,features,"Aug. 15, 2019",Are We Sure Aaron Rodgers Is Still An Elite Quarterback?,Josh Hermsmeyer,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"Ask most NFL coaches, players or decision makers if Aaron Rodgers is elite, and they’ll probably look at you like you’re either new or slightly inebriated. In the recently revealed NFL Network’s Top 100 Players of 2019, the league’s players ranked Rodgers as the fourth-best QB in the league, behind Drew Brees, Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady, and the eighth-best player overall. Likewise, 53 of 55 coaches and executives polled by The Athletic’s Mike Sando ranked Rodgers as a tier 1 quarterback — results that elevated him over Brady as the most esteemed quarterback in the NFL in the eyes of the league’s decision-makers.
Questioning Rodgers’s ability normally borders on football insanity, but in recent seasons, the statistics of the Packers’ quarterback haven’t exactly matched his outsize reputation. So as Rodgers prepares for his 12th season as the Green Bay starter and his first under a new coach, we dare to ponder the unthinkable: Are we sure Aaron Rodgers is still elite?
There’s no doubting Rodgers’s excellence early in his career. From 2008 — his first year as a starter — to 2014, Rodgers led the Packers to a 70-33 record1 and a Super Bowl win while throwing for 8.3 yards per pass attempt and winning two MVP awards. Over that same period, Rodgers passed for 225 touchdowns, good for a TD rate of 6.6 percent.
Since 2015, however, the Packers have gone a cumulative 30-24-1 with Rodgers under center, and the QB hasn’t been as sharp as he once was. Over the past four years, Rodgers’s yards per passing attempt dropped more than a yard from his previous career average to 7.1,2 and his TD rate fell a percentage point to 5.6 percent. Perhaps more worrying, there are important areas of the field where Rodgers isn’t simply no longer excellent — he’s actually worse than league average.
I looked at all passes charted with a direction that Rodgers has thrown since 2015, as recorded by ESPN Stats & Information Group, and compared his passes with a direction given to the league average in the same area of the field:
Rodgers has particularly fallen short of the rest of the league on intermediate throws. When he threw 11 to 25 yards downfield over the past four seasons, Rodgers completed fewer passes than we’d expect from a league-average QB. Depending on the area of the field, the deviation from expected performance was sometimes alarmingly high. On passes charted as being thrown to the “far left” area of the field between 11 and 20 yards deep, Rodgers completed passes a whopping 17.6 percentage points under expected.
Part of this could be explained by the injury and subsequent decline of Rodgers’s former favorite target, Jordy Nelson, who was an outside threat for most of his career in Green Bay. But Rodgers’s struggles haven’t been limited to outside throws: Since 2015 on throws to the middle-left, middle-right and center of the field, at depths from 11 to 25 yards, Rodgers has a completion percentage 1.4 points under expected.3
What’s notable is that — based on work done by Sarah Mallepalle — the deep middle and intermediate middle areas of the field are among the most efficient places to pass the ball, so Rodgers’s poor performance there is particularly curious.
One possible explanation for the Packer’s underperformance in the middle of the field is the play-action passing game. Play-action fakes are designed to draw linebackers and safeties toward the line of scrimmage to defend the run, leaving the intermediate middle and deep middle areas of the field open. Play-action passes are also among the most efficient types of plays an NFL team can run, so a lack of success on these plays could help explain Rodgers’s recent deficiencies.
When we look at the numbers, it turns out that’s exactly what we find. Since 2015, the Packers rank dead last in the league in yards per dropback on play-action passes. Rodgers started just 55 of those 64 games because of injuries, so it’s only fair to break out his performance separately. But when we look just at games Rodgers started, things don’t get much better. Among quarterbacks in that same span with at least 100 play-action pass attempts, Rodgers ranks last in passing yards per dropback and 32nd out of 41 in Raw QBR, behind the likes of journeymen (Brian Hoyer), much-derided (Derek Carr and Eli Manning) and recently deposed quarterbacks (Blake Bortles and Ryan Tannehill).

Rodgers and the Packers managed 1.4 yards per dropback less than league average on a play type that is wildly effective for the vast majority of the league. Cincinnati quarterback Andy Dalton — a player no evaluator would claim is Rodgers’s equal on the field — was able to squeeze out 2 yards per dropback more than Rodgers on 71 more play-action passes. When Jacoby Brissett, Trevor Siemian and Brock Osweiler are able to post yards-per-dropback numbers superior to a former Super Bowl winner and league MVP, something unexpectedly terrible has happened.
Many have pointed to the lack of creativeness in former coach Mike McCarthy’s play designs, so perhaps we can put some of the blame there. According to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, Rodgers would routinely change plays he felt were poor calls, and Tyler Dunne of Bleacher Report quoted an unnamed source who claimed that Rodgers audibled to a new play up to a third of the time. The same source claims that those audibles netted very poor results for the Packers. Under new Green Bay head coach Matt LaFleur, early signs are that the incessant audibling will stop. LaFleur said at the NFL combine in February that packaged plays — not audibles — are a staple of the Kyle Shanahan offense he’s bringing to Green Bay.
And perhaps more important to the future success of Rodgers and the Packers is the more aggressive and creative play-action game LaFleur is bringing with him from Tennessee. The Titans averaged 7.3 passing yards per dropback on play-action passes to the Packers’ 6.6 in 2018, and I believe much of the difference between the two teams can be explained by a lack of creativity on the part of the Packers.
Two plays versus the Miami Dolphins from last season help to explain the disparity. In Week 10, the Packers would beat the Dolphins 31-12, but Green Bay gave a glimpse into why their play-action game was so underwhelming in 2018.
The call was a play-action bootleg in which the quarterback fakes a toss to the running back and then turns and rolls out to the opposite side of the field. Despite Rodgers’s strong arm, McCarthy’s play design calls for just two eligible receivers to run routes into the Dolphins secondary, and no routes are run attacking the void created by the two Miami defenders flowing to the line of scrimmage on the far side of the field chasing the fake. Ultimately, Rodgers checks down to tight end Lance Kendricks for a short gain after finding his deep options covered.

Meanwhile a call from Week 1 by LaFleur against that same Miami Dolphins defense offers an interesting contrast. In a game in which the Titans lost 20-27, LaFleur called a play-action boot, but it featured three receivers attacking downfield, including a very sneaky tight end leak route that took advantage of the Dolphins’ over-aggressiveness defending the run. Despite a poor throw by Marcus Mariota, which caused the receiver to stop his route and wait for the pass, the play was good for 30 yards and set Tennessee up with first-and-goal.

For Green Bay fans, it isn’t hard to imagine A-Rod putting enough air under the ball on a similar play call to net the Packers a touchdown. It’s this kind of aggressiveness and creativity that landed LaFleur the Green Bay job this offseason and could help Rodgers return to something close to his early career form.
At 35, Rodgers is on the downslope of his career — which, in fairness, could last five to eight years more based on recent QB longevity. But either way, the Packers need to provide him with every possible edge if they want to win another Super Bowl and avoid the disconcerting reality that sole possession of the highest-rated quarterback in NFL history secured them only one Lombardi Trophy. A revamp of the hyperefficient play-action passing game seems like a terrific place to begin.

Can He Flip A Senate Seat Instead?,Nathaniel Rakich,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Another passenger has boarded the S.S. Winnow: On Thursday, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper announced he was dropping out of the race for president.
Many of the problems we identified with Hickenlooper’s campaign when he first entered the race ended up coming true. He lacked a geographic or demographic base, and he proved unable to stand out from a flashier field of candidates. Despite hopes that he would make some noise in the debates, he didn’t make a positive impression in the first and spoke less than any other candidate in the second.
The result: Hickenlooper never found his footing among actual voters. When he dropped out of the race, a majority of Democrats (56 percent) still did not have an opinion of him, according to a FiveThirtyEight average of August polls. But even if Hickenlooper had more successfully gotten his name out there, he just wasn’t what voters were looking for. Even in Colorado, where he is well-known and well-liked among Democrats,1 Hickenlooper received just 7 percent of the vote in a Public Policy Polling survey of the presidential primary. Nationally, he never wound up exceeding 2 percent in any poll:
Hickenlooper’s campaign had been struggling for months, so this wasn’t an unexpected announcement. In early July, six of his top staffers left the campaign after urging him to drop out and run for U.S. Senate in Colorado instead. There was so little grassroots appetite for his candidacy that, four months into his campaign, he had reportedly amassed only 13,000 individual donors (one-tenth of the required number to qualify for the September debate). At the time, an anonymous source said staff told Hicklenlooper his campaign was on pace to run out of money by the end of August, so it’s possible Hickenlooper simply could not afford to continue his campaign.
Hickenlooper’s failure is notable because, as a two-term governor of a swing state, he had a great traditional résumé for a presidential candidate; it’s fair to think that if he had run in, say, 1992, he might very well have become the nominee (or at least made more of a showing). But Hickenlooper’s fate is another data point suggesting we can throw some of those old priors out the window. Nowadays, it appears more important to many Democratic primary voters that a presidential candidate either has revolutionary ideas, better represents the diversity of the party or both. And former Vice President Joe Biden, perhaps the only candidate with better traditional credentials than Hickenlooper, is sucking up all the oxygen among the remainder of the electorate.
Indeed, it’s notable that the candidates to qualify for the September debate so far are Biden and then an array of boundary-breaking candidates — three women (Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar), three people of color (Harris, Sen. Cory Booker and Andrew Yang) and a gay man (Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana). Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke are the exceptions, but even they have the novelty of democratic socialism and youth, respectively, on their side. The race’s many straight, moderate and/or older white men look likely to be culled from the debate stage, and we expect some to join Hickenlooper in bowing out of the race. (Of course, we’ll have to wait and see — perhaps some will break out of the pack.)
The other notable thing about Hickenlooper’s departure from presidential politics is the question of what he does next. Many hope he’ll challenge Republican Sen. Cory Gardner back home in Colorado. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has reportedly met with Hickenlooper repeatedly to pressure him into running, and Hickenlooper said in his drop-out video that he will give it “some serious thought.”
But with about a dozen Democrats already running in that race, others believe his presidential dalliance has cost him a clear shot at a Senate nomination that would otherwise have been his for the taking. I agree to a point — it is far from certain that they will all drop out in deference to Hickenlooper. In fact, former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff said on Thursday he would not do so. In addition, former state Sen. Mike Johnston has raised more in total contributions for his Senate campaign ($3.4 million) than Hickenlooper did for his presidential campaign ($3.2 million)!2 And both Johnston and former diplomat Dan Baer had more cash on hand than Hickenlooper at the end of last quarter, so those two can also probably afford to stand and fight if they want to.
On the other hand, I still think Hickenlooper would be strongly favored to win the nomination. His fundraising would almost surely pick up (and his rivals’ would dry up) if he sets his sights a little lower. And two hypothetical polls of the race have given Hickenlooper huge leads. The same PPP poll that showed Hickenlooper at 7 percent in the presidential primary put him at 44 percent in the Senate primary, followed by Romanoff at 12 percent. (None of the six other candidates included in the survey received more than 4 percent.) And a more recent poll from Garin-Hart-Yang put Hickenlooper at 61 percent, Johnston at 10 percent and Romanoff at 8 percent. One caveat: Both polls were sponsored by unknown Democratic organizations, and they may have a vested interest in tempting Hickenlooper to run for Senate.
That’s because Hickenlooper is widely seen as Democrats’ strongest possible general-election candidate, and Colorado is virtually a must-win for Democrats if they want to take back control of the Senate. According to the Garin-Hart-Yang poll, 61 percent of Democrats think Hickenlooper has the best chance of defeating Gardner in the general election. (Most respondents said electability was more important than ideology in determining their primary vote — so, ironically, Hickenlooper could end up essentially becoming the Biden of the Colorado Senate field.)
There are reasons to think Hickenlooper would present a particularly strong challenge to Gardner. He’s already won two statewide elections in Colorado — and in tough years for Democrats (2010 and 2014) to boot. And another PPP poll, conducted just last weekend, gave Hickenlooper a strong 13-point lead over Gardner.
But personally, I’m not convinced. Just as early polls of the presidential general election can readily be dismissed, I don’t think that PPP poll shows us much beyond name recognition. Plus, that poll was sponsored by 314 Action, which definitely has a vested interest in tempting Hickenlooper to run for Senate (314 Action is a group that promotes scientists running for office; Hickenlooper is a former geologist).
Additionally, Hickenlooper is on record saying he doesn’t want to be a senator. He has said, “I’m not cut out to be a senator” and “I don’t think that’s my calling.” There is even video of him saying “the Senate doesn’t attract me” and “if the Senate’s so good, how come all those senators are trying to get out?” I would expect to see those clips show up in an attack ad or two.
Finally, in a presidential year, I’m just not sure any Democrat would perform that much better than another. In this era of partisanship über alles, Senate races track very closely with the presidential results in their states. Gardner’s fate probably hinges on how closely associated he is with President Trump, and Trump’s standing come Election Day, more than on the quality of his opponent.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/obamacares-unpopularity-suggests-medicare-for-all-may-be-a-hard-sell/,2019-08-14,,,features,"Aug. 14, 2019",Obamacare’s Unpopularity Suggests Medicare For All May Be A Hard Sell,Dan Hopkins,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"The first and second Democratic debates have made one thing clear: A number of major policy reforms are on the table, including sweeping proposals on health care and climate change. And many of these ideas appear popular among the majority of Americans. A July Marist poll found that 63 percent of Americans said a plan like the “Green New Deal,” which would address climate change by investing heavily in environmentally friendly jobs and infrastructure, was a good idea; similarly, 70 percent said they supported “Medicare for all who want it,” which would give Americans a choice between government-sponsored health insurance and private insurance.
But beneath those top-line numbers are red flags about just how much the popularity of these reforms depends on how they are written and enacted. That same Marist poll found, for instance, that most Americans do not think “Medicare for All” is a good idea if it means replacing all private health insurance with the government version. This is important to keep in mind as public opinion toward a complex policy can be dictated by the plan’s least-popular element.
Let’s take the Affordable Care Act as an example. Just before Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009, 51 percent of Americans in an Associated Press poll said “implementing a national health care plan” was a top priority. And early in Obama’s presidency, the majority of Americans surveyed in a 2009 CNN poll approved of the job he was doing on health care. But once the law passed in 2010, it was generally rated unfavorably until President Trump took office and the prospect that the law would be scrapped became real.
For many commentators and advocates of the health care law, this was surprising. I wrote in 2010 that it wasn’t that health care reform was unpopular, but rather the political debate was turning people off — and I figured that once the law passed, public opinion might shift in the ACA’s favor. After all, it’s a complex law with a wide variety of provisions, including an expansion of Medicaid and protections for people with pre-existing conditions, plus smaller items that might have flown under the radar, like reducing tax breaks on insurance company executives’ pay and adding support for seniors’ prescription drug payments.
Many of the law’s individual provisions were quite popular. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll from December 2014, around three-quarters of Americans favored the ACA’s creation of insurance exchanges, the law’s subsidies for lower-income Americans’ insurance costs and the Medicaid expansion. Sixty percent even supported the law’s mandate that employers with at least 100 employees pay a fine if they didn’t offer health insurance. However, that pattern didn’t hold for one key element of the ACA, the individual mandate. It required all Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. The mandate has consistently polled poorly, with just 35 percent saying they supported it in that 2014 KFF survey.

Still, if Americans’ overall attitudes toward the ACA were a weighted average of their views on its individual parts, the ACA should have been popular. But that clearly wasn’t the case: In that KFF survey, 41 percent had a favorable view of the law overall compared with 46 percent who had an unfavorable view. In other words, Americans’ opinion of the law overall were quite close to their opinion of the individual mandate, its least-popular provision.
And that may be in part because of the law’s many provisions, only a few have gotten sustained public attention, including some of the law’s more unpopular features. In a March 2017 KFF survey, 82 percent of Americans said they knew about the individual mandate while 69 percent said they knew about the subsidies for low-income Americans and 65 percent said they knew about the Medicaid expansion.
To better understand what Americans knew about other aspects of the law, Cornell University’s Will Hobbs and I conducted an online survey in the fall of 2018 where we asked respondents whether a variety of policies were included in the original ACA. This survey wasn’t representative — respondents were not randomly selected from the general population, and instead opted to take an online survey.1
A majority of respondents were only able to recognize four of the main elements of the ACA: the individual mandate, the provision allowing young adults to remain on their parents’ insurance until age 26, the creation of the health insurance exchanges to buy insurance, and protections for pre-existing conditions. Only 34 percent knew that the ACA involved substantial taxes for people in upper income brackets, and only 29 percent knew that it had closed the loophole in Medicare prescription drug coverage. Even fewer (17 percent) knew that it included a provision to limit the tax breaks companies received on salaries paid to insurance company executives.
So what does this mean for major policy proposals like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal? Well, the ACA provides a cautionary tale. Initial polling about major initiatives can be misleading. And even if most elements of a policy poll well, public opinion may come to be driven by the policy’s least-popular items. That’s especially true if the opposition launches an extended campaign against it.
The ACA also highlights an important difference between how policymakers and the public think about a complex policy. For the ACA’s architects, the legislation was an integrated whole, with various provisions working in tandem to increase access to comprehensive insurance. The individual mandate, for example, was thought to be critical to driving younger, healthier people to buy insurance and to keep overall costs down. But when making sense of that same policy, citizens focused on just a few of its most salient — and controversial — elements. In other words, when it comes to public opinion, the ACA made it clear that the whole is often not the sum of its parts — and that could spell trouble for other big policy proposals.

Candidates in the 2020 Democratic primary race gave speeches at the Iowa State Fair, and many of them also spent a good part of last week crisscrossing the state, laying out policy proposals for rural areas. It was the most concentrated attention the first-in-the-nation caucus state has received so far this cycle, and that attention is likely going to ramp up as we get closer to the caucuses. In this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew discusses just how important Iowa really is to winning a party’s nomination.
The team also takes a look at American voter opinions and the science of aging to address the question of whether someone can be too old to be president. This comes after the press has focused on Joe Biden’s age in recent weeks as he’s made some major gaffes on the campaign trail.

The current crop of young players are ruining the game: They aren’t famous enough, strike out too much and hit too many home runs. Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio, indeed.
This is, of course, mostly just nostalgia-tinted silliness. We’re really going to complain that there are too many home runs? Really? Even if you do take offense with the prevailing style of baseball in 2019, it shouldn’t obscure the fact that today’s up-and-coming stars are objectively awesome. From Cody Bellinger and Ronald Acuña Jr. to Mookie Betts and Fernando Tatís Jr. — to say nothing of Mike Freaking Trout, who is only 28 years old — MLB is awash in young talent just begging to be properly appreciated, if we bothered to take the time.
The truth is, this particular season might contain the best group of young or prime-age hitters there has ever been, which is saying something in a sport whose history runs back to the 19th century. According to wins above replacement,1 position players age 25 or younger (as of June 30) have produced 17 percent of leaguewide value — the 25th-largest share in any season since 1901 — and those between age 25 and 30 have accounted for 28 percent of all WAR — the fifth-most ever, and second-most2 since 1917.
Added together, under-30 hitters are producing roughly 45 percent of all WAR in baseball this season, the highest share in modern history. Trout alone accounts for 1 percent of that (!) — his greatness is a whole story unto itself — but he’s not the only 20-something position player who’s shining in 2019. Here are the best players by WAR at each age and the percentile rank for their season, relative to other seasons at the same age in baseball history:

Some of this onslaught of young star power was to be expected, such as with Trout and Christian Yelich — a pair of former MVPs — or Alex Bregman, who became that kind of player last season. Even Acuña, whose full-season breakout seemed apparent from the beginning of the year, could be included on that list. Some of it has involved precocious young players maturing quickly, as in the cases of phenoms such as Tatís and Juan Soto, or midseason call-ups like Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette and Yordan Álvarez. Others still have either improved themselves to truly dominant levels (Bellinger, Marcus Semien) or seemingly emerged out of nowhere to become borderline MVP candidates (Ketel Marte, Pete Alonso). All have combined to give us the most potent group of under-30 position players the game has ever seen.
WAR is adjusted for the league’s run environment and the overall value of various statistics, so this isn’t just a matter of today’s players seeing their value pumped up by record home run rates. There are always only so many WAR to go around in a given season, and this crop of young batters are grabbing a greater share than any of their historical counterparts. This is “Generation OPS,” and they’ve bent the game to their will. Instead of moaning about those changes, we should take a moment to appreciate the historic nature of what they’re doing.
Of course, since WAR is a zero-sum game, other player groups have suffered at the expense of these bright young hitters. One cohort whose struggles aren’t all that surprising is older (age 30 and up) position players, who now account for just 13 percent of all the value produced in MLB. That’s the lowest share they’ve had since 1901, breaking the old record of 14 percent set last season and a far cry from the 28 percent mark which 30-and-over hitters achieved 20 years ago, at the height of the steroid era in 1999.

Although the effect of performance-enhancing drugs on 1990s power numbers may have been overstated, one of the underrated effects of those chemical enhancements was the extension of productive careers beyond the normal aging curve. Now that those anomalies seem to be a thing of the past, aging hitters are less valuable — and less desirable — than ever before.
A group whose struggles are perhaps more surprising, on the other hand, is the current batch of young pitchers. Pitchers under age 30 this season account for just 24 percent of all major league WAR, their smallest share since 2001, and the subgroup of pitchers age 25 or younger have produced only 7 percent of WAR, their smallest share since 1996.
Some stellar young pitchers have bucked this trend. Atlanta’s Mike Soroka, 22, is having one of the best seasons ever by a starter so young, and the crop of slightly older hurlers — which includes Lucas Giolito of the White Sox, German Marquez of the Rockies and Shane “Don’t Call Me Justin” Bieber of the Indians — have been lights out. But as a whole, pitchers age 25 or younger have put up only 17 percent of pitching WAR leaguewide and have logged only 20 percent of all innings across baseball — the lowest share of innings pitched since 1947.
Ancient pitchers (age 35 and older) aren’t in great shape, but they’ve nearly tripled their share of pitching WAR from last year.3 And prime-age or slightly old hurlers (between age 26 and 34) are doing great, recording 74 percent of pitching WAR4 and eating 73 percent of innings — the third-most ever for that age cohort.5 Despite longstanding evidence that fastball velocity and overall pitching effectiveness peaks in the early 20s and declines progressively with age, the list of 30-something pitchers having great seasons this year is incredible, especially when juxtaposed against how few batters can say the same:

As good as those older pitchers are, however, their value still pales in comparison with the young sluggers who step into the batter’s box against them every night. Amid MLB blaming its own players for not being more famous and all the complaining about Three True Outcomes, it can be easy to lose sight of how exciting this young crop of stars is. But don’t be fooled by older generations pining for a version of baseball that doesn’t exist exactly the way they want it to anymore. The game now belongs to players like Bellinger, Acuña, Tatís and Soto — and it’s going to be greater for it.

On today’s show, our team looks at the strategies behind fantasy and dissects how it both reflects and distorts the game.
The English Premier League has formally kicked off with familiar faces leading the pack. Reigning back-to-back champion Manchester City leads in our model. Liverpool, which fell just 1 point short of the title last season, is again slated for second place. We’ll discuss what to expect this season and which teams might shake up the top of the table.
To wrap, Neil explores the Orioles’ unexpected win this weekend over the Astros and other historic baseball upsets in our Rabbit Hole of the Week.
What we’re looking at this week:
We still have not recovered from Simone Biles’s record-breaking, history-making, mind-blowing performance at the USA Gymnastics National Championships.
If you’re looking to spice up your fantasy football league this year, here are some creative ideas from The Ringer.

Who Could Blame Them?,Clare Malone,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"Sometimes I wonder what I would be thinking about all day if I weren’t thinking all day about politics.
I sort of fell into this line of work. I wanted to write for a living and to live in a city where my friends were, which turned out to be Washington, D.C. I was less than happy working in a golf course conference room for a fledgling import-export company, living at home and pretty regularly sobbing alone in my bedroom. (It was post-crash America, and I’m decently confident that this scenario meant that I was better off than about 90 percent of recent college grads.) A guy I knew who worked at a political magazine maneuvered my résumé out of a pile, and a course was charted that has led me here, to 2019, where I think about politics all day, every day. I fantasize, occasionally, about becoming an archaeologist — I think I would like all the camping, plus the time spent in cool, musty museum labs with papyrus and pottery shards.
Up until recently, these fantasies of “something-else-besides-politics” were logical because it seemed like a lot of the country wasn’t very interested in politics. It made me feel sort of useless — who really read this stuff outside of D.C.? Was it making a difference? But now things are different — people are paying attention. Perhaps it’s because of President Trump — a 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 52 percent of Americans said they were paying more attention to politics since his election. My colleague Geoffrey Skelley recently wrote about just how much attention likely Democratic primary voters were paying to the Democratic primary — a lot, it turns out. Forty-five percent of people in one survey done this year said they were paying “a lot” of attention to the campaign, compared with only 28 percent of people who said the same thing in a similarly-phrased poll question from 2015.
But to what end is that engagement? Last year, the Public Religion Research Institute found that 69 percent of Americans felt sad, angry or fearful when they thought about what’s going on in the country today. But only 19 percent of people had gotten in touch with an elected official in the last year, just 14 percent had volunteered and a paltry 12 percent had attended a community meeting, like a school board or city council meeting. For all the sadness some Americans feel, and for all our tuned in-ness to politics, we don’t seem to be doing much politically proactive day-to-day.
I write this not to name and shame America, but to identify with its ennui. It’s difficult not to talk day after day about the ups and downs of the election without pulling back every once in a while and wondering who all the talk and writing is for. A recent Gallup survey found that 68 percent of Americans aren’t proud of our country’s political system; according to a Pew survey from July, only 46 percent of people who say they have a generally high threshold of personal trust also say they have confidence in elected officials to act in the best interests of the public — that figure drops to 27 percent among people who express low levels of generalized trust. That’s abysmal, and they’re the kind of numbers that make a person think: If a lot of Americans have decided that they have no faith in the process, then why painstakingly chronicle it? Is political coverage in an age of disillusionment simply a self-contained symbiotic act? Are reporters like me just a little Egyptian plover bird in the crocodile’s jaw, picking at bits of food in its teeth to survive?
I’ll answer “no” for the sake of my job and because of an abiding belief that records of history must be kept — it’s probably some medieval Irish monk DNA at work. But there’s also no innate virtue in political engagement; I won’t plead with Americans to get “more political.” A friend of mine once said that she thought of journalism as helping people understand the world around them in a deeper way. It might just be that people understand American politics just fine — we have the numbers to show that they’re paying attention — it’s just that they don’t like what they see.
Disillusionment played a role in the last presidential election. Indifference, too. Trump and Hillary Clinton were historically unpopular candidates. Trump’s election was a shock in part because pre-election day polls and models were on shakier ground than in years past, thanks to the high number of undecided voters (you can read Nate Silver in depth on the phenomenon here), and a whole lot of people Democrats depended on to elect Barack Obama ended up staying home that November. There’s nothing to say that the 2020 election won’t see similar dynamics.
I’m just one woman, with only the thoughts stirring in my own brain to offer, but I think America’s ennui, its pervasive, high-information sadness, has something to do with the blurring line between what is a “political issue” and what is a “moral issue.” Partisan discourse is so strong, so all-encompassing, that to render judgements about what is a violation of those inalienable rights we are all supposed to cherish, is to take a political stance. Today, the issue of immigration — portrayed on the national stage not long ago in the dry language of H1 visas, pathways to citizenship and legislative solutions — is now a moral morass of separated families, dead children and unsanitary, overcrowded holding facilities. Massacres of elementary school children have become common enough that schools have adapted with the brisk practicality we expect of our teachers — active shooter drills help little children envision what to do in the event their nightmares are made flesh. Writing these sentences will make some readers angry since they will be seen as a promotion of a Democratic Party line — but what’s a political journalist to do when she lays her moral compass on the table, and it points in just one direction on these things?
Americans of both parties oppose family separation. You can also watch a steady, national trend toward greater support for stricter gun control over the past decade. The public expressions about the need for change on our new moral issues are clear, but the political system isn’t built to acknowledge this.
Perhaps people choose not to engage with politics because they know that partisanship’s brittle paradigm will shatter when it takes on the heft of a moral load. It isn’t equipped to handle the problems that plague our consciences. Maybe America is right to feel sad.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-las-vegas-aces-are-sharing-the-spotlight-and-winning-a-lot/,2019-08-14,,,features,"Aug. 14, 2019",The Las Vegas Aces Are Sharing The Spotlight — And Winning A Lot,Jenn Hatfield,FiveThirtyEight,WNBA,"Before her injury in July, Las Vegas Aces forward A’ja Wilson was going through a down season compared to her WNBA Rookie of the Year campaign of 2018. She was scoring less, grabbing fewer rebounds and blocking fewer shots. But she was still selected as one of two captains for the 2019 All-Star Game.
Her team might have a lot to do with that. At the All-Star break in 2018, the Aces were in ninth place with a 12-13 record. But this year, in what coach Bill Laimbeer has called “year two” of a three-year rebuild, the Aces entered the break 13-6 and tied with Connecticut for first place.
Wilson didn’t play in the 2019 All-Star Game, but two of her teammates did: Liz Cambage and Kayla McBride. All three were selected as starters, the first time since 2009 that one team had three of the game’s 10 top vote-getters. But that’s not all of the talent the Aces have: The other two regular members of their starting five are both former No. 1 overall draft picks (Jackie Young and Kelsey Plum), and the bench includes a forward who has been called the WNBA’s “biggest disruptor” (Dearica Hamby), a veteran with 204 career starts (Tamera Young) and a 2017 All-Star (Sugar Rodgers).
The Aces assembled this talented roster by collecting the past three No. 1 draft picks and trading for Cambage and Rodgers during the offseason. But the most talented rosters don’t always win — just look at last year’s Minnesota Lynx, which finished 18-16 and lost in the first round of the playoffs despite having four 2016 Olympians in the starting lineup. Team chemistry and buy-in to shared goals are paramount, and even star players usually have to take fewer shots than they would on a less balanced team.
Wilson is the perfect example. She averaged 20.7 points and 8.0 rebounds per game in her stellar rookie year but is at 15.4 points and 6.6 rebounds this year — not a bad season by any means, but a dropoff nonetheless.
The Aces’ record alone suggests that the buy-in is there, but let’s see whether the statistics support the idea that players are sacrificing individual numbers for team success.
The Aces have shared the load offensively
Cambage, Rodgers and most of the Aces’ returners from 2018 have taken fewer shots, scored fewer points and played fewer minutes in 2019. McBride is taking 3.4 fewer shots in almost three fewer minutes on the court. Tamera Young was a starter a year ago, averaging nearly 10 points in 27 minutes per game, but she has accepted a bench role in 2019 and averages just 5.4 points. Forwards Carolyn Swords and JiSu Park have likewise seen their minutes decrease to accommodate Cambage. And after requesting a trade out of Dallas, where she was her team’s No. 1 option, Cambage approved the move to Las Vegas knowing that she would likely get fewer touches.

The only players who have seen their roles increase are Hamby and Plum. Hamby’s role has expanded in part because of Wilson’s injury and in part because she is playing like the front-runner for Sixth Woman of the Year (or Most Improved — take your pick). Plum, a third-year guard and the NCAA’s all-time leading scorer, has received praise from Laimbeer for her improvements defensively, and her shooting is the perfect complement to Cambage’s interior presence.
Looking at players’ usage rate1 tells a similar story. Wilson and McBride, the Aces’ leaders in usage rate a season ago, have the ball in their hands less this year, and Cambage and Rodgers do as well. Plum ranked only eighth on the team in usage rate a season ago,2 and Park and Swords were behind her, so every player who touched the ball frequently last season is getting fewer touches this year.
They’ve struggled some on offense
Of course, the fact that nearly every Aces player is scoring fewer points per game could suggest that the team is simply struggling offensively, not sacrificing individual numbers for team performance. Comparing the Aces’ offensive statistics over the past two seasons supports the idea that the offense isn’t yet clicking: The team is scoring fewer points per game and shooting worse from the field (while playing at a nearly identical pace). Its offensive rating has decreased by 4.4, which means that this season’s Aces score 4.4 fewer points per 100 possessions.

However, it’s not all bad on offense for the Aces. They are taking and making significantly more 3-pointers this season than in 2018, and they’re registering slightly more assists. The problem appears to be turnovers: The Aces are giving the ball away on more than 18 percent of their possessions this season, 3 percentage points more than a season ago.
Individually, nearly every Aces player has a lower offensive rating than a season ago, in part because of worse shooting and in part because of turnovers. Yet many players have increased their 3-point rate and increased or maintained their 3-point shooting percentage. This includes McBride and Rodgers, despite the fact that they are two of the better 3-point shooters in the league and therefore are improving on an already high bar.
They’ve excelled on defense
Another way to gauge the buy-in of a team is to look at how it’s performing on defense, where commitment and communication are perhaps even more important. Both as a team and individually, the Aces have excelled on defense in 2019. Las Vegas ranked first in the WNBA through Aug. 12 in defensive rating, allowing just 91.9 points per 100 possessions and allowing opponents to shoot only 39 percent from the field.

With the addition of Cambage, it’s no surprise that the Aces are getting a higher percentage of defensive rebounds than in 2018 and blocking more shots. However, Cambage is not known as a lockdown one-on-one defender, and allowing 11 fewer points per game than a season ago3 requires more than adding a talented player. It requires buy-in from every player. And that’s exactly what Las Vegas has gotten: Every single returning player has improved her defensive rating from a season ago.

In addition, every player except Wilson has improved either her steal rate or her block rate — or both. And all but Wilson and Park have already equaled or exceeded their defensive win shares from last season — an impressive feat given that win shares accumulate throughout the season. Finally, despite the team’s offensive struggles, four of the nine players are averaging more win shares per 40 minutes than they did a season ago.
What this all adds up to is a team that seems to have committed to Laimbeer’s vision but is still adjusting to a new offense. That offense asks players to take many more 3-pointers while also giving Wilson and Cambage regular touches in the post, which is a difficult balance to strike. The Aces can also take solace in the fact that, despite being in position to secure a top-four seed and a first-round bye in the playoffs, they are nowhere near their ceiling offensively. Their improved defense has carried them this far, and if and when their offense catches up, look out. That’s a scary prospect for the rest of the WNBA.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Riddler Express
From Corey Grodner, balance a bunch of billiard balls:
You have 12 billiard balls. To the naked eye, they all look identical, and in your hand, they all feel identical. One of the balls, however, is slightly heavier or slightly lighter than the others, but you don’t know which ball or whether it is heavier or lighter.
You do, however, have a balance scale. You can place any equal number of balls on each side of the scale, and the scale will tilt if one side differs in weight. (Note: There is no use in weighing different numbers of balls against each other — the weight difference is so slight that if the scale has more balls on one side, that side will always be heavier.) However, you can only use the scale three times.
How can you determine which ball is different, and whether it is heavier or lighter?

Riddler Classic
From Dave Moran, in which we revisit his classic Riddler technicoloring game:
Almost three years ago, we first introduced in this column a two-player map-coloring game played with writing utensils and a piece of paper. It works like this: Call the two players Allison and Bob. On each turn, Allison draws a simple closed curve on a piece of paper. Bob then colors the interior of the “country” that curve creates with one of his many crayons. If the new country borders any existing countries, Bob must color the new country with a color different from the ones he used for the bordering countries.
For example, the game might begin with Allison creating Country 1, Bob coloring it green, Allison creating Country 2, Bob coloring it pink, and so on.
In this edition of the game, suppose Allison wins when she forces Bob to use a seventh color. How many countries must Allison draw to win?
For context, Allison won the original game a few years ago when she forced Bob to use a sixth color. In that instance, she needed to draw eight countries.
Extra credit: Is there an upper limit on the number of colors Bob can be forced to use? If so, what is it? If not, why not?

Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 👏 Amanda Pierson 👏 of Washington, D.C., winner of last week’s Riddler Express!
Last week, the Puzzle Party National Committee was organizing a series of debates for the 20 candidates running for its presidential nomination. Twenty was too many to fit on a stage at once, so in each round of debate the PPNC would separate the candidates into two panels of 10. Candidates, by PPNC rule, were only allowed to criticize those candidates with whom they shared a stage. But the PPNC wanted to provide ample opportunities for such shade-throwing. What was the minimum number of rounds of bifurcated 10-candidate debates such that each candidate got an opportunity to personally attack every other candidate?
The minimum number of rounds was three.
For example, in the first debate, the panels are set like this:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
In the second debate, like this:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
And in the third debate, like this:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19
Scott Wickham offered a helpful explanation for how to arrive at such an arrangement: Split the candidates up into what effectively becomes four teams of five people. They’ll move together as a unit. You can then think of the debates as a round-robin tournament, where each “team” plays the other three teams once — therefore enabling candidates to see the other 15 people on stage over the course of three debates, as well as the four people they are paired with in every debate.
Let the shade fly!
Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👏 Orestis Papaioannou 👏 of Nicosia, Cyprus, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic!
Last week, you pondered the constructive possibilities of a pond you owned (with a radius of 1 yard) and your large collection of thin boards (each 1 yard long). Specifically, you wondered: How many boards were necessary in order to cover the center point of the pond with a board? To avoid falling in the water, the ends of each board needed to lie on either the banks of the pond or on another previously placed board.
You could cover the center point with as few as 12 boards.
That arrangement looks like the image below, as constructed by solver Tim Black, who also wrote a lovely blog post about how his brain and his computer combined forces to arrive at this solution. The main idea is to build a sort of scaffolding inward from the banks of the pond that is both large enough to eventually build into the center but sparse enough to avoid using too many boards. One helpful way to approach this, as with many Riddlers, is to work backwards — start with the board that will reach the center point and build your scaffolding out from there.
Solver Zach Wissner-Gross tried ever so hard to construct an 11-board arrangement, but demonstrated in the animation below that 11 boards just aren’t quite enough.

I really, really tried to get 11 using a symmetric arrangement. As you can see, the two central beams are never a distance 1 apart. So close, and yet so far! pic.twitter.com/dnkDX4T82L
— Zach Wissner-Gross (@xaqwg) August 14, 2019

And why stop with just this one pond? This puzzle’s submitter, Erich Friedman, has assembled a collection of efficient center-covering board arrangements for ponds of various sizes — and not just circular ponds but triangular, square and pentagonal ponds as well.
Have a great weekend. If the weather’s nice, you can find me down at the local pentagonal swimming hole, a pile of boards under my arm.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/forget-lanes-the-democratic-primary-is-a-whole-freaking-transit-system/,2019-08-13,,,features,"Aug. 9, 2019",Forget ‘Lanes.’ The Democratic Primary Is A Whole Freaking Transit System.,Nate Silver,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"If you’ve read our Slack chats or heard our podcast, you’ll know that I get annoyed whenever the discussion of “lanes” — such as the left/liberal lane versus the establishment/moderate lane — comes up in the context of the Democratic primary. Without getting too far into the weeds,1 I basically have two beefs with most of the analyses I see.
Beef Numero Uno: These analyses tend to treat voter preferences as being frozen in time — they’re about who the voter supports now, and perhaps who the voter currently lists as their second choice. But to the extent that lanes are interesting, it’s because they tell us something about the route a voter took in coming to a decision. A voter who backed Bernie Sanders in 2016 but has since switched to Elizabeth Warren won’t show up as a Sanders supporter if you ask about her current preferences, for instance. But the evolution of this voter’s choice of candidates would actually be evidence of the existence of a left/liberal policy lane.
Second, these analyses are usually oriented around an effort to either prove or debunk the existence of a particular type of lane, usually the liberal or moderate lanes. But voters come around to their decisions for lots of different reasons. Some voters do vote on the basis of ideology or policy. Some vote on demographics or identity. Some factor in more abstract considerations like “leadership” or “electability.” And some just haven’t thought deeply about their choices yet. When candidates are aligned along several different dimensions — for instance, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O’Rourke have much in common in terms of their demographics and their policy platforms — you can see especially strong correlations in which voters support them, with one tending to rise or fall at the other’s expense. But most of the time, it’s messier, with different threads pulling in different directions.
To extend the lanes metaphor, you wouldn’t expect to see a single, parallel set of lanes connecting all voters in the Democratic primary. Instead, you’d expect something more like a complex, multi-modal transportation network, where some parts of the network are more robust than others, but there are a lot of somewhat redundant options. This doesn’t mean that paths between different candidates are irrational or random, any more than the choices of, say, Manhattan commuters are. But they might look chaotic in the aggregate if you don’t recognize that different voters have different priorities and take different routes to get there.
Let’s think about voters who supported Sanders in 2016, for instance, and which candidates they might be supporting now if they aren’t sticking with Bernie. Voters four years ago might have had several reasons to prefer Sanders to Hillary Clinton:
Some voters — such as those who do choose candidates on the basis of ideology — liked Sanders because he was proud to wave the flag for democratic socialism. These voters would probably be inclined to back Warren, if they aren’t staying with Sanders.
Some voters liked Sanders because he was an anti-establishment outsider. I’m not sure where these voters would go today. They certainly wouldn’t be inclined to go to Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, who have the most support from the party establishment. But they might also see Warren as too establishment-friendly. Maybe more eccentric candidates like Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang would work for this group. But I’d expect a lot of anti-establishment types to stick with Sanders. In fact, that seems to describe a lot of the voters he’s currently left with. If you look at donations, for example, a lot of Sanders donors don’t seem to be interested in donating to any of the other candidates, suggesting that he’s somewhat of an island unto himself.
Some voters liked Sanders because he is a white man. I’m not saying this is an especially large group of voters. But there are certainly some, and maybe quite a few. They have lots of other white guys to choose from if they want to move on from Sanders: Biden, O’Rourke, Buttigieg and so forth.
Relatedly, voters who associated Sanders with the white working class and supported him on that basis, or who believe that a candidate who does well with white working-class voters is more “electable,” might be attracted to Biden this time around, in addition to Sanders.
Some younger voters liked Sanders because of his emphasis on policies like free college tuition, and because he came to unexpectedly represent a break from the hegemony of Baby Boomer-dominated politics. It’s not totally clear who these young voters are supporting yet — they can be hard to pin down in polls, and they can sometimes be late to engage in the process. But Buttigieg, Yang and O’Rourke have the potential to overperform with young voters relative to the electorate overall.
Finally, some voters just aren’t tuned in yet. The notion that Sanders and Biden’s support is just name recognition is mostly misguided, in my view. But it’s certainly true for some voters. These voters’ preferences may simply reflect who they’ve been hearing about in the news lately, which recently has meant Biden, Warren and Harris in addition to Sanders.
So if you run through this list, you certainly do see some major highways that connect Sanders and Warren. But there are also a lot of ways to get from Sanders to Biden. And there are some byways that link Sanders to several of the second-tier or minor candidates, most notably Gabbard, Buttigieg, Yang and O’Rourke. The one major candidate who doesn’t have a lot of obvious connections with Sanders is probably Harris. It’s sort of like trying to get from the West Village to the Upper East Side. You can certainly do it, and they aren’t that far apart as the crow flies, but it requires an extra transfer or two.
All of that might sound good in theory, but is there any data on who Sanders’s 2016 voters are supporting now? Actually, yes! Emerson College, in its national polls, has broken out results based on who Democrats said they supported four years ago.

This data actually does a good job reflecting our “predictions” from above about how Sanders’s support from 2016 might map to the various candidates this year. (Granted, it’s easy to make “predictions” when you get to see the data before making them, as I did in this case.) Start with some of the lesser-known candidates. Gabbard and Yang might not have that many supporters, but the ones they do have are drawn disportionately from former Sanders voters. O’Rourke and Buttigieg also do better with former Sanders voters than with ex-Clinton ones.
Among the major candidates, there are quite a few Sanders 2016 –> Biden 2020 voters, although not nearly as many as there are Clinton 2016 –> Biden 2020 voters. Harris gets her support mostly from Clinton voters; relatively little comes from 2016 Sanders voters, consistent with our hypothesis.
Warren is, by contrast, drawing about equal shares of Clinton 2016 and Sanders 2016 voters. Maybe you’re surprised that Warren’s numbers aren’t more slanted to former Sanders supporters, but keep in mind that (i) there are plenty of connections between Clinton and Warren too, e.g. in their appeal to college-educated women; (ii) whereas Clinton’s voters need to look around for a new candidate, Sanders 2016 voters have the option of picking Sanders again. One way to look at it is that 44 percent of Sanders 2016 voters are voting for either Sanders or Warren this time around, while just 24 percent of Clinton 2016 voters are.
So there almost certainly is a robust left policy/ideology lane in the Democratic primary. It’s probably even one of the more well-traveled routes. It’s just far from the only road in town.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

What Comes Next?,Neil Paine,FiveThirtyEight,NFL,"One of the big questions that could swing the entire 2019 NFL season has few answers in the way of historical evidence: How will Tom Brady and Drew Brees (and, to a lesser extent, Philip Rivers) fare as they hit ages when few — if any — quarterbacks have ever been good before?
Brady turned 42 a week ago and Brees hit 40 in January. (Rivers turns 38 in December.) Both were very good last season, with each finishing among the league’s top eight QBs in numerous statistical categories including ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating, Football Outsiders’ Defense-adjusted Yards Above Replacement and Pro-Football-Reference’s Approximate Value — where each posted a score of at least 14.
Speaking to the last figure, it was the first time since 19601 that three QBs aged 37 or older each produced that much AV in the same year. Being an old passer has never been so good. But no matter how much water Brady drinks, Father Time will get his ‘W’ eventually. Brady, Brett Favre, Warren Moon and Vinny Testaverde are the only QBs to ever put up 10 or more AV in a season at age 40 or 41, and no QB in history has ever recorded more than 5 AV at age 42 or older.
So, given that we know the end will come sooner or later… what will that decline look like for this current generation of aging quarterbacks? Will it come quickly — vindicating Max Kellerman — or will Brady and Brees just gradually lose effectiveness over time, while simultaneously easing into a reduced role?
In that regard, we can turn to history for at least some clues. Of the 29 retired QBs who had at least 10 AV in a season at age 36 or older, 12 saw a gradual decline after their final double-digit AV campaign, posting at least 5 AV in another subsequent season. (That’s not a very good number for a starting quarterback — it’s quite mediocre, in fact — but it’s not the mark of a complete disaster, either.)
They eased down the hill…

Quarterbacks must be currently retired to qualify.
Source: Pro-Football-Reference.com
Even after the final good seasons for Hall of Fame QBs like Favre, Moon, Marino and Len Dawson, they still managed to eke out at least one more year of moderately effective play before either totally fading away or simply retiring. (Or having the worst final game ever.) These relatively gentle declines offer one model for Brady and Brees to follow as the aging curve begins to hit hard.
Moon and Favre are especially interesting test cases, since each had been very good as they approached 40 before suffering down seasons. (Moon played only eight games and posted 4 AV in 1996; Favre played all 16 games and had 12 AV in 2008, but struggled greatly with an injury down the stretch and had a below-average QBR of 46.0.) Both responded the following year with terrific performances, defying the effects of time, and then even hung on for another additional 5-AV season before the end truly came. A similar tale applied to Washington’s Sonny Jurgensen, who appeared to fall off a cliff at age 37 and played only 12 combined games across 1971 and ‘72. But Jurgensen returned to spot duty behind Billy Kilmer (who would later join this list himself) in 1973, then mustered a very good year as a part-time starter in 1974 before retiring for good.
And longtime Oilers and Raiders QB/kicker George Blanda is such an outlier that he deserves his own deep dive. Blanda was a full-time starter for just one season (1953) before age 33, but the upstart American Football League offered him the chance at a second act to his career. All he did with it was throw for 20,984 yards and 188 touchdowns over his final 16 seasons in pro football — a period which, again, began at age 33. By age 40, Blanda was done as a regular QB, but he stuck around for another nine seasons as a kicker who occasionally spelled main starters Daryle Lamonica and Ken Stabler under center. I wonder how good Brady and Brees are at kicking field goals.
In many of these instances, the star quarterback had already been asked to take on less responsibility than in earlier days. Marino’s 218.6 yards per game in 1998 was one of the lowest marks of his career, and his Dolphins were running the ball more than they had in years. In a way, that shift mirrors a turn both the Patriots and Saints have already taken in recent seasons. New Orleans relied on the run in 2017 and 2018 more than in any other year this decade, while 2018 saw the Pats’ third-most carries in a season during the 2010s. In addition to their own unprecedented longevity, Brees’s and Brady’s teams have also put them in a position to succeed at an old age.
But the “gentle decline” option is not the one most productive old QBs take. In our sample of 29 QBs, 17 (or 59 percent) either fell off badly or had the good sense to retire — either way, that was it for their careers.
…And they fell off the cliff (or just retired)

Quarterbacks must be currently retired to qualify.
Source: Pro-Football-Reference.com
The retirement option has its appealing case studies — chief among them being John Elway, who posted 14 AV for the 1998 Denver Broncos, won the Super Bowl and then moved on to his next careers as a business owner, team executive and Nerf football pitchman. (Brady could have done this last February, but decided to give it at least one more go — unsurprising, given his stated intention to play until age 45.) Fellow stars Roger Staubach, Phil Simms, Fran Tarkenton and Kurt Warner all retired after good seasons, too, perhaps seeing the writing on the wall despite still being productive.
Among the dozen who didn’t retire, however, the end was not pretty. We can break them down into a few categories:
Lost starting QB job: Chris Chandler;2 Charley Johnson; Ed Brown; Earl Morrall; Craig Morton.
Injured most of season: John Brodie; Steve Young; Rich Gannon.
Played very poorly: Y.A. Tittle; Johnny Unitas; Peyton Manning; Vinny Testaverde.
Some players could belong in multiple categories. Gannon, for instance, wasn’t playing well even before an injury ended his 2003 season, while Tittle played through an injury in 1964 and struggled as a result. But all involved a QB losing effectiveness (whether due to age or injury) and quickly reaching the end of his productive career.
Manning, Young and Gannon might be the most pertinent cautionary tales for today’s aging stars. Each was cruising along at an MVP level at an advanced age — exactly like Brees and Brady have done the past few years3 — but within a season of that, they were basically done as productive quarterbacks. Injuries played a big role in each case: Young had suffered multiple concussions by Week 3 of the 1999 season, Gannon was injured early in both the 2003 and 2004 seasons, and Manning missed Weeks 10-15 of the 2015 season with plantar fasciitis. If Brady and Brees do meet an unexpectedly swift end to their careers, it will probably follow the same pattern.
For now, of course, we don’t know how and when the end will come for the sport’s most prominent old-timers. Brady and Brees have already blown up the aging curve for quarterbacks, ushering in what The Ringer’s Kevin Clark called “the era of the Forever QB.” Brady just signed a new two-year contract extension,4 based off of the deal Brees signed with New Orleans in March 2018. In each case, both team and player are delicately balancing between committing to a franchise icon and keeping options open for the future. That’s probably smart: If the history of old NFL quarterbacks still has meaning, the end for Brees and Brady could come gently — but more likely, it will come without warning.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

15 percent of pharmacies
Nearly half of the opioid pills sold in the U.S. from 2006 to 2012 were purchased by just 15 percent of the pharmacies, according to the Washington Post’s ongoing analysis of a large federal pain pill database. That 15 percent includes pharmacies such as Shearer Drug in Clinton County, Kentucky, which had the equivalent of 96 pills per person, based on that county’s population. [The Washington Post]
10,000 firearms
Since the mass shootings at Christchurch mosques that killed 51 people, New Zealand’s government has purchased more than 10,000 firearms as part of a buyback program. The government there, by a vote of 119-1, outlawed most automatic and semiautomatic weapons and set aside NZ$150 million to buy the guns that were newly illegal. [The Guardian]
1,650 species
The Trump administration announced yesterday that it would dramatically weaken the Endangered Species Act — the law “credited with rescuing the bald eagle, the grizzly bear and the American alligator from extinction.” Some Republicans have long argued that it places an “unnecessary regulatory burden” on businesses, while environmentalists note that humans could soon drive a million species into extinction. Since the law was passed in 1973, 1,650 species have been added to its rolls as threatened or endangered, while 47 have been removed from it thanks to growing populations. [The New York Times]
8 million simulated universes
Over three recent weeks, scientists at the University of Arizona used that school’s Ocelote supercomputer to generate 8 million simulated mini-universes, in which, presumably, there were 8 million simulated mini-Significant Digits columns that you were reading on 8 million simulated mini-mornings on 8 million simulated mini-iPhones. In any case, the work was done to better understand how real world galaxies develop and evolve. [Engadget]
44 percent of campaign days
There is a man named Joe Sestak who is reportedly running for president, and he has spent 44 percent of his campaign days in the great state of Iowa, a far higher share than any other candidate. But fear not, Iowa has still enjoyed its share of love from the field — major Democratic candidates have spent a cumulative 336 days campaigning there, and 216 campaigning in its fellow kingmaker, New Hampshire. Nevada, however, which also goes early in the nomination process, has been largely overlooked, with just 74 cumulative days of campaigning. [FiveThirtyEight]
$10 billion market
Nike is launching a kids’ sneaker subscription service, Nike Adventure Club, whereby, depending on your chosen tier, your 2- to 10-year-old child will receive a new pair of sneakers in the mail every one, two or three months, presumably saving a harried trip to the mall. However, I always enjoyed shoe shopping for ancillary mall Orange Juliuses. Perhaps Orange Julius should start a symbiotic subscription service. Anyway, the kids sneaker market is worth an estimate $10 billion. [Reuters]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-will-make-the-third-democratic-debate-and-who-could-miss-it/,2019-08-13,,,features,"Aug. 13, 2019",Who Will Make The Third Democratic Debate (And Who Could Miss It),Geoffrey Skelley,FiveThirtyEight,2020 Election,"UPDATE (Aug. 13, 2019, 9:55 a.m.): Tom Steyer’s campaign announced Tuesday morning that it had hit the 130,000 donor mark. He now needs just one qualifying poll to make the third debate.


Time is running out for Democratic candidates to make the third presidential primary debate in September. There are about two weeks left to qualify, and because of the debate’s higher thresholds, it’s likely that there won’t be 20 candidates — although the debate may still span two nights. Nine candidates have already qualified by our count, and a handful of others could also make it. (In previous debates, the Democratic National Committee capped the stage at 10 participants each night, but it hasn’t yet specified what it will do for the third debate.)
However, it is unlikely that the debate field will grow much beyond 12 or 13 candidates, as it’s much harder to qualify this time than it was for the previous two debates. Not only do candidates have to meet both the polling and donor requirements, but they also must meet higher thresholds. To qualify, candidates must attract at least 2 percent support in four qualifying national or early-state polls released between June 28 and Aug. 28, and they must also have 130,000 unique donors (including at least 400 individual donors in at least 20 states).1
Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang is the latest to join the ranks of those to make the stage, having gotten his fourth qualifying survey last week. (He already met the donor mark in early July.) And former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro is right on the cusp — he has hit the donor requirement and needs just one more poll.

*For candidates deemed “major” by FiveThirtyEight.
To qualify, a candidate must reach 2 percent in at least four national or early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations and must have at least 130,000 unique donors with at least 400 donors in at least 20 states. Information released by campaigns is used to determine whether a candidate has hit the donor threshold. If a campaign reached 130,000 donors but did not say whether it had at least 400 donors in 20 states, we assumed that it had met the latter requirement as well. Candidates will have to prove to the DNC that they have met the donor requirements.

Castro isn’t the only other candidate who’s close to making the third debate. There are three others who stand a reasonable chance of qualifying. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has already surpassed the 130,000 contributor mark, but she has just one qualifying poll to Castro’s three, so it will be tougher for her to get three more polls by Aug. 28. Not that this has stopped Gabbard from trying: In an email to supporters, she encouraged them to sign up for online survey panels and to answer calls from unknown numbers that might be a pollster dialing.
Meanwhile, despite jumping into the race only in early July, billionaire activist Tom Steyer may be in an even better position than Gabbard, having already hit at least 2 percent in three of the four qualifying polls he needs. Now it’s just a matter of hitting 2 percent in one more poll and clearing the donor requirement, which his campaign said in an email to supporters last week that it could do “as soon as” this week. It doesn’t hurt that Steyer has a huge organizing advantage — he can draw on the more than 8 million email addresses amassed by Need to Impeach, an anti-Trump group Steyer founded, not to mention additional contacts from NextGen, another Steyer organization.
The third candidate who seems to have a shot of making the stage (albeit a long shot) is New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who got her first qualifying poll last week. She still needs three more polls to qualify and, as of Aug. 7, approximately 30,000 more contributors to meet the donor requirement, but she’s still much further ahead than the other bottom-tier candidates.
In fact, the rest of the Democratic field will likely not make the cut. While former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has one qualifying poll to his name, he reportedly had only 13,000 donors as of July 2. (He may also be exploring a possible Senate run back in Colorado.) Two other candidates, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and author Marianne Williamson, have reportedly surpassed 100,000 contributors but have yet to hit 2 percent in any qualifying surveys. As for the remaining seven candidates deemed “major” by FiveThirtyEight, none seems remotely close to 130,000 donors, and none has a single qualifying poll yet.
But failing to make the third debate isn’t necessarily all she wrote for some of the lower-tier candidates. According to an email sent by the DNC to the campaigns earlier this month, polls that count toward qualification for the third debate will also count for the fourth debate in October (date still TBD). In theory, that means a candidate who came up short of making the third debate might be able to pick up enough qualifying surveys and donors to make the fourth debate. However, failing to make the third debate might signal to potential supporters and prospective contributors that a candidate isn’t worth backing, thus making it harder to get the polls and donors necessary to qualify for the October event.
So don’t be shocked if some of the candidates who miss the third debate drop out of the race — recall that California Rep. Eric Swalwell withdrew not long after it became apparent that he would probably not qualify for the second debate. Time will tell, but the requirements for making the third and fourth debates will probably do more to winnow the sizable Democratic field than to help lower-rung candidates hang around.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-one-hospital-skewed-the-cdcs-gun-injury-estimate/,2019-08-13,,,features,"Aug. 13, 2019",How One Hospital Skewed The CDC’s Gun Injury Estimate,Sean Campbell,FiveThirtyEight,Gun Violence,"For years, the estimates of nonfatal gunshot injuries published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have grown increasingly unreliable — in 2017, they were more suspect than ever. But researchers have continued to cite the numbers as authoritative. Last year, a CDC spokesperson defended the data, saying the agency’s experts were “confident that the sampling and estimation methods are appropriate.”
Now the CDC is taking measures to curtail the spread of its most unreliable estimates. The 2016 and 2017 gun injury figures have been hidden on the agency’s public data portal, with a footnote stating “Injury estimate is not shown because it is unstable.” The CDC will hide unstable estimates for all injury types within the next six months, according to a spokesperson. Also, the option to include statistical information about how reliable or unreliable the estimates are is now enabled by default. Until recently, it was disabled by default.
The changes follow reporting by FiveThirtyEight and The Trace, a nonprofit news organization covering gun violence in America,1 that highlighted the unreliable estimates.
The CDC’s gun injury estimate was vulnerable to unreliability in part because of how few hospitals are surveyed in the data set that feeds it. When one hospital is replaced by another in the database the CDC uses, the changeover can cause the injury estimate to swing drastically. The CDC now says it is exploring the feasibility of collecting data from more hospitals, which would improve the estimate’s reliability.
An analysis by The Trace and FiveThirtyEight shows just how sensitive the current model is to changes in the sample. There’s no national database dedicated to tracking shooting incidents, so the CDC uses a more general injury database managed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The number of gun injuries treated in each hospital in the database is fed into a statistical model that extrapolates a national estimate. The smaller the number of hospitals in the pool, the larger the effect each one has on the estimate. Over time, hospitals leave the sample for a variety of reasons and are replaced.
The trouble is, the departing hospital and its replacement may treat very different numbers of injuries. From at least 2000 to 2010, a hospital labeled Primary Sampling Unit 41 submitted data to the CPSC’s panel. Raw numbers published by the CDC and CPSC show that this hospital treated a very small number of gunshot injuries: fewer than 10 each year from 2005 to 2010, and just 20 total over that six-year span. When this hospital dropped out of the database in 2010, it was replaced halfway through 2012 with a different one that treated a dramatically larger number of gun wounds: 793 during its first full year in the dataset.2
Using methods developed in a 2017 paper that demonstrated the effect of hospital replacements in a larger but similar database, we analyzed data from the CDC and CPSC to measure the impact of this one substitution. The new hospital added over 22,000 nonfatal gun injuries to the 2015 national estimate — more than 100 times greater than the most ever contributed by its predecessor.3 This hospital — one of the 60 or so used in the sample — accounts for over one quarter of the total estimated gunshot injuries that year, which is the most recent data available.
When making a substitution in the database, the CPSC attempts to match the replacement hospital to the original based on some characteristics, such as its geographic location and size. But according to Guohua Li, editor-in-chief of the medical journal Injury Epidemiology and founding director of Columbia University’s Center for Injury Science and Prevention, the CDC’s methodology doesn’t take into account factors like the volume of gun injuries treated, which leaves the estimate vulnerable to dramatic jumps like this one. He says the quickest way to address the problem would be to adjust the methodology to account for the larger volume of gun injuries.
The CDC acknowledges that hospitals that have recently been added to the system have been adding more gunshot injuries to the national estimate than the hospitals they replaced. “The influence of a gradually changing roster of participating hospitals does not translate to poor data quality,” the spokesperson from the CDC said in an email, “but rather reflects the varying characteristics of these hospitals.”
Other gun injury estimates are less susceptible to the distortions that hospital selection can introduce. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, another database under the Department of Health and Human Services, uses data from more than 950 hospitals to create its own gun injury estimate — far more than the CDC. Among multiple sources of national gun injury data that The Trace and FiveThirtyEight reviewed last year, the CDC’s was the only data set that consistently showed an increase in gunshots from year to year — an indicator that its estimates are out of step with other reliable data sources.
In May, the CDC’s leader acknowledged that the numbers needed to be fixed. Responding to an inquiry by 11 senators, CDC Director Robert Redfield wrote in a letter that the agency intends to “improve the precision and accuracy of [its] non-fatal firearm injury estimates.”
One solution would be to add more hospitals to the sample. “By expanding the roster of participating hospitals,” Redfield wrote, “the influence of any one hospital should be reduced and more stable estimates should be attainable.”
The CDC and CPSC are currently in the process of evaluating the system that is generating the national injury estimate, along with whether it needs to be expanded and how much it would cost to do so.
Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey lawmaker who led the group that wrote the original letter this spring, is continuing to keep pressure on the agency. A new letter signed by him and four other Democratic senators says that “the CDC’s explanation falls short” and pushes Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar for clarifications about several of the points in Redfield’s response.
Li is happy the CDC is willing to make a change. “But I wish they had acknowledged the problems identified in a more straightforward way.”",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

75 percent favorable
In 2015, after the Supreme Court had upheld same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act, only 33 percent of Republicans viewed the court favorably. Now, after the confirmation of two justices nominated by President Trump, 75 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of the court. Its favorability among Democrats has fallen from a high of 72 percent in 2016 to 49 percent today. [Pew Research Center]
1.3 percent of revenue
As Amazon builds out its own delivery fleet — drones and robots included? — FedEx is severing its ground-delivery ties with the company, two months after it also ended its air-delivery contract. FedEx said Amazon accounted for 1.3 percent of its revenue last year, or some $850 million. [The Associated Press]
1,000s of tardigrades
The Israeli lander that crashed on the surface of the moon in April apparently spilled thousands of tardigrades — strange-looking microscopic “water bears” — onto the lunar surface. A harsh environment for life, to be sure, but tardigrades are known to survive just about anything, and indeed can survive for years in “dormant states in which all metabolic processes stop and the water in their cells is replaced by a protein that effectively turns the cells into glass.” Good luck up there, little guys. [Wired]
$572 million loss
Despite the fact that its revenues doubled, DeepMind, Google’s AI outfit that developed superhuman chess-playing programs, lost $572 million last year. DeepMind owes a debt of 1.04 billion pounds this year, which includes an 883 million pound loan from Google. The company has shifted to health care research and is working on an algorithm that can look at medical imagery to find head and neck cancer and can diagnose eye disease. [Bloomberg]
4.7 million subscribers
Shortly after it had taken sharp and widespread criticism for its headline about President Trump’s response to the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, including from some who claimed they were canceling their subscriptions, The New York Times announced that it now has 4.7 million paid subscriptions, a high for the newspaper. The Times has a stated goal of 10 million subscriptions by 2025. [The New York Times]
61 percent of Americans
My colleague Nathaniel Rakich explored the shifting popular support for stricter guns laws over the past 30 years. The latest Gallup poll, for example, shows that 61 percent of Americans support stricter gun laws while 30 percent think the laws should remain as they are. Overall, support for stricter laws fell from highs of about 75 percent in the early 1990s to lows below 50 percent in the late 2000s, though it has risen again over the past few years.

Back in May, I used data from the Des Moines Register and New England Cable News to see how many events each presidential candidate had held in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to hold their presidential primaries. Today, I’m updating that analysis to include the two remaining early-voting states1 — Nevada and South Carolina — using data from the Nevada Independent and Charleston Post and Courier. And instead of looking at total events, I’m now going to look at the share of days that each Democrat has spent in the four states since they announced they were running. (Looking at the share of days rather than total events helps account for the fact that some candidates entered the race earlier than others. For a similar reason, I am limiting my analysis to the time they’ve spent running since Election Day 2018.)
Overall, although Nevada and South Carolina enjoy a prime spot on the calendar, it’s clear from the numbers that Iowa and New Hampshire are still considered the main kingmakers in the primary. Through the end of July, the 23 Democratic presidential candidates that FiveThirtyEight considers “major”2 have spent a cumulative 336 days campaigning in Iowa, 216 campaigning in New Hampshire, 74 in Nevada and 132 in South Carolina.3 The overall pattern so far goes something like this: Most candidates visit Iowa and New Hampshire a lot and Nevada and South Carolina a little. For example, this is true of former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. (It is worth noting, though, that in contrast to the narrative that Biden isn’t holding as many public events as other candidates, he has spent 22 percent of his days as a declared candidate in an early state, which is pretty average for the field.) But, of course, not every candidate follows that pattern.

Let’s start in Iowa, both the first state to vote and the most popular destination for most candidates. Seventeen of the 23 candidates have spent a plurality of their early-state campaign time in the Hawkeye State.
If you calculate visits as a share of the days that each candidate has officially been in the race, former Rep. Joe Sestak has been the most active campaigner in Iowa, by far. Sestak has held at least one Iowa event on 17 different days, which may not be all that impressive in absolute terms, but considering he just got into the race six weeks ago, it means he’s spent 44 percent of his days as a declared candidate in Iowa. Furthermore, he has not yet visited any of the other three early states (although he is planning a visit to New Hampshire), suggesting that getting a foothold in Iowa is a priority for his campaign.
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock ranks a distant second for time spent in Iowa — although, at 18 percent of his campaign days, the state still represents a fair chunk of his time on the trail. Like Sestak, Bullock is white, belongs to the moderate wing of the party and has emphasized his ability to win in Republican-leaning areas (like … Iowa!). In other words, he’s exactly the kind of candidate whose hopes of winning the nomination rest on doing well in the Hawkeye State. And indeed, he has only spent 3 percent of his campaign days in any other early state. A little further down the list, Rep. Tim Ryan and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper have also spent much more time in Iowa than in the other three early states combined. (Not coincidentally, they are white moderates from the middle of the country as well.)
Sen. Amy Klobuchar hasn’t focused on Iowa quite as much as Bullock, Ryan or Hickenlooper, but she has spent an above-average 12 percent of her campaign days in Iowa. That could be because the Minnesotan sees next-door Iowa as a good fit for her Midwestern persona (although unlike in New Hampshire, politicians from neighboring states haven’t historically had a special advantage in the Iowa caucuses).
By contrast, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke shows up near the top of the list of Iowa campaigners mostly because he is a relentless campaigner overall. He has spent more than a third of the 140 days since he launched his campaign in one of the four early states — most other candidates are spending less than a quarter of their time in them. So while it’s true that he has spent more time in Iowa than the other three early states, as we’ll see, he ranks high in time spent in other early states as well.

Meanwhile, the most familiar face in the Granite State is Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. She’s spent 11 percent of her campaign days in New Hampshire and is one of just four Democrats who have spent more time in New Hampshire than in Iowa. Rep. Seth Moulton also seems to be focusing on New Hampshire, especially in contrast with Iowa; he has spent 8 percent of his campaign days in the former but just 2 percent in the latter. And a New Hampshire-centric campaign strategy might make sense for these two. New Hampshire has historically favored candidates with local ties: Gillibrand went to Dartmouth, and Moulton represents a Massachusetts congressional district on New Hampshire’s southern border.
Marianne Williamson has spent the second-largest chunk of her campaign in New Hampshire (10 percent of her campaign days), but that appears to be less indicative of her campaign strategy. Like O’Rourke, who himself is a frequent New Hampshire tourist, Williamson has been a prolific campaigner everywhere. She has spent 40 percent of her campaign days in one of the four early states, so spending 10 percent in New Hampshire just means she’s splitting things up fairly equally.
Finally, I was surprised to see that Sen. Bernie Sanders had spent just 4 percent of his campaign days in New Hampshire. The Granite State is a natural fit for Sanders, since he is from next-door Vermont and won 61 percent of the primary vote there in 2016, but he has spent more time in Iowa and South Carolina. However, I think that might be a smart campaign strategy for Sanders, as his built-in advantage in New Hampshire may allow him to do well there regardless. So by campaigning harder in Iowa, Sanders may be calculating that it increases the chances that he wins there as well as in New Hampshire, a one-two punch that would set him up well for the rest of the race. And his visits to South Carolina may demonstrate that he knows he needs to do better in a state where he got blown out in 2016.

As for Nevada, no candidate has spent a plurality of their time in the Silver State. In fact, most Democrats are spending barely any time there. In the period we looked at, from the 2018 midterms to the end of July 2019, six candidates didn’t visit Nevada at all after declaring their candidacy. And all but one have spent less than 5 percent of their campaign days there. This is a bit surprising, since Nevada will be the third state to vote in 2020 — it comes before South Carolina, yet the Southern state is a more popular campaign destination.
Williamson is the only candidate to spend more than 5 percent of her time in Nevada — 8 percent of her campaign days have involved at least one event there. Part of this is because Williamson has distributed her many campaign visits almost evenly between the four early states, which means that, almost by default, she has spent more time in Nevada than any of the other candidates. Sen. Cory Booker has also tried to give equal attention to all four states, so even though Nevada is his least-visited state, he still ranks second there, having spent eight days of his campaign in the state. Moulton, perhaps surprisingly, ranked right up there with Booker, also at 4 percent. In fact, Moulton has come closer than any other candidate to making Nevada a centerpiece of his campaign strategy. Almost a quarter of his days in early states have been spent in Nevada, a higher percentage than any other candidate.

Again, because of her packed travel schedule, Williamson (11 percent of campaign days) ranks first for the share of time spent in the Palmetto State. The latest entrant to the race, billionaire Tom Steyer, ranks second, having spent 9 percent of his campaign days in South Carolina — but he had only been actively running for 23 days as of the end of July, so that means he only spent two days so far in South Carolina. Whether he continues to prioritize South Carolina (or New Hampshire, the only other early state he visited in July) remains to be seen.
The biggest thing that jumps out from the South Carolina data, though, is how much more time Sen. Kamala Harris is spending here (8 percent of her campaign days) than in any other state. Harris has caused consternation in both Iowa and New Hampshire for not devoting as much attention to those two more traditional (and, it should be said, whiter) early states, but it’s probably smart of her to prioritize South Carolina. Harris has made efforts, with some success, to appeal to black voters, who make up a majority of the South Carolina Democratic electorate. For example, she has already won nine endorsements from members of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Honorable mentions also go to Booker and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Booker has spent 7 percent of his campaign days in South Carolina, which makes it his second-most-frequented early state. (Like Harris, Booker is hoping that support from black voters will help carry him to the nomination.) And the 6 percent of his campaign days that de Blasio has spent in South Carolina also make it his second-most-visited state.


With six months to go until these states start voting, there’s obviously plenty of time for candidates’ strategies to change. But the data we have now gives us a pretty clear idea of which candidates are putting all their eggs into one early-state basket — and where candidates might want to visit next.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-supreme-court-stay-above-the-partisan-fray/,2019-08-12,,,features,"Aug. 12, 2019",Can The Supreme Court Stay Above The Partisan Fray?,Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux,FiveThirtyEight,Supreme Court,"Faced with a solid majority of conservative justices on the Supreme Court for the first time in decades, a number of Democratic presidential candidates have said they’re open to increasing the number of seats on the court or establishing term limits for the justices, in an effort to dilute the conservatives’ power. Pete Buttigieg, for example, proposed a plan that would increase the number of Supreme Court justices to 15 in an attempt to balance the court ideologically. Other candidates, like Beto O’Rourke, have called for term limits.
These proposals haven’t been especially prominent in the primary so far, but a new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that Democrats’ views of the court are at their lowest point in more than two decades — signaling that primary voters could be in the mood for more talk about radical changes.
The Supreme Court is often regarded as the one branch of government that’s above the messy business of partisan politics. And 62 percent of respondents in the Pew survey did say they have a positive outlook on the court — much higher than favorability ratings for Congress or either of the two political parties. But Americans’ views of the Supreme Court have grown somewhat less favorable over time, and in the past few months, an unusually large partisan gap has opened up.
As the chart below shows, the share of Democrats who have a favorable outlook on the court plummeted from 63 percent in January to 49 percent today. Favorability among Republicans also took a small dip this year, but they’ve recently warmed to the court — as recently as July 2015, only 33 percent of Republicans had a favorable view of the court compared with 75 percent today.
And even though Republicans and Democrats’ views of the court are fairly malleable, and tend to shift around big events or decisions, an uptick in partisan rancor could prompt the justices to tread carefully in a year when the justices will already be addressing hot-button issues like President Trump’s effort to end Obama-era protections for young undocumented immigrants and workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation. “A 26-point gap between the parties is jarring — this seems like a fairly unprecedented situation,” said Michael Salamone, a political science professor at Washington State University who studies public responses to the Supreme Court. “If entrenched partisan views of the court persist, it could have a longer-term impact on the court’s legitimacy,” he added.
This isn’t the first time a political rift has emerged around the court. In the 1930s, Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously grew frustrated with the justices’ rejection of his New Deal policies and sparked a political firestorm by trying to add as many as six new seats. Several decades later, “Impeach Earl Warren” signs popped up in response to the liberal chief justice’s decisions on desegregation. And Richard Nixon explicitly ran against Warren court rulings that had expanded criminal defendants’ rights, including the landmark Miranda decision, in his 1968 campaign.
Historically, however, none of these episodes have fundamentally undermined the public’s faith in its legitimacy as an institution. Some scholars have argued that this is in part because when the court gets too far outside the mainstream, the justices usually back down. As I wrote for FiveThirtyEight last year, there is plenty of evidence that the justices, despite their lifetime appointments and seemingly unlimited power, do bend to the winds of public opinion. One study, for instance, found that the court’s overall ideological tilt generally tracks with the public’s over time. Tom Clark, a political science professor at Emory University who studies the Supreme Court and public opinion, said that talk about court-packing among the Democratic candidates could send a signal to the justices that a significant chunk of the public is unhappy with its rulings.
So one question, as the primary progresses, is whether the Democratic candidates will focus more on reforming the court. According to Pew, the court’s favorability is particularly low among liberal Democrats, which could make court-packing a popular issue among primary voters. But proposing to overhaul the structure of a branch of government is also no small thing. A study of Roosevelt’s bid to pack the court found that most voters were skeptical of his plan, even if they didn’t like what the justices were doing. And a Fox News poll conducted in April found that 51 percent of Americans oppose increasing the number of justices on the court.
But the deep partisan split in how the court is viewed could still affect how the justices operate, at least while the presidential election unfolds. “I think they’ll want to keep their docket as boring as possible, to avoid the spotlight,” Salamone said. Staying under the radar could be difficult, though, given that the court already has several high-profile cases lined up. And with a case involving abortion rights also on the horizon, the partisan divide could deepen even further.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z
https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mike-trouts-one-rule-for-hitting/,2019-08-12,,,features,"Aug. 9, 2019",Mike Trout Will Probably Just Ignore Your First Pitch,Travis Sawchik,FiveThirtyEight,MLB,"Graphics by Gus Wezerek
The God of WAR does not spend much time thinking about analytics.
Outside the cafeteria in the visiting clubhouse in the depths of Cleveland’s Progressive Field, Mike Trout, the best player of baseball’s information age, said he employed little of the data or tech available to him as he passed Ty Cobb and Mickey Mantle for most wins above replacement1 by a player age 27 or younger (71.7 career WAR) this season.
“I don’t look at any of that stuff,” Trout told FiveThirtyEight.
Trout turned 28 on Wednesday, and he might be at the peak of his powers. He’s on pace for his fourth 10-plus WAR season in his career. While pitching velocity is increasing every year, breaking balls are moving more and strikeouts have ballooned, Trout has reduced his strikeout rates in recent years and continues to add power. He is on pace to lead the AL in on-base and slugging percentage for the second time in three seasons.2 But he isn’t interested in mapping his swing or understanding his launch angle (which has increased from 14 degrees in 2015 to 21.2 degrees this season, ranking 12th in baseball).
He does have one rule: Almost always take the first pitch. “I did that in the minor leagues,” Trout said. “I took until I got a strike. I think that helped me understand the zone.”
From the start of the 2015 season through Aug. 4, Trout has swung at just 15.9 percent of first pitches, which is the 22nd-lowest rate in the majors among the 549 players in that time who have seen at least 500 pitches, according to Baseball Savant data analyzed by FiveThirtyEight. This season, Trout is offering at 15.4 percent of first pitches, ranking 27th among the 438 hitters hitters who have seen least 250 pitches. On all zero-strike counts since 2015, Trout has swung at just 21.5 percent of pitches, ranking as the 21st-most discerning hitter in such situations. On all zero-strike counts this season, Trout has swung at just 22.3 percent of pitches, which ranks 33rd.
Few players put themselves in favorable situations as often as the best player of his generation, in large part because of his don’t-swing-until-he-gets-a-strike approach. This has a compounding positive effect for Trout as he can then zero in on his preferred zone of choice. He’s leading the AL in walks (87), and he’s on track to easily surpass his career high for home runs (41 in 2016), given that he has 38 home runs already this season.
“I just have a zone,” Trout says. “If I get a pitch I think I can hit, a light goes off to swing. If I don’t get it, I’m not going to swing.”
He also rarely swings at a first-pitch ball,3 though opponents throw less than 40 percent of their pitches to him within the strike zone anyway, and he offers at out-of-zone pitches only 19.3 percent of the time — the fifth-lowest chase rate in baseball. So he’s getting in more favorable counts more than most major league batters.
FiveThirtyEight analyzed every pitch Trout has faced this season and outcome of each pitch. Trout doesn’t usually take his bat off his shoulder early in counts, and much of his production comes in favorable counts.
Trout ranks 12th in baseball this season in the share of pitches seen while being ahead in the count, at 34 percent.4 (The MLB average is 26.9 percent.) And he takes 38.2 percent of his total swings when he’s ahead in the count, which ranks him 15th in MLB. When he gets ahead, Trout dominates: He ranks third in weighted on-base average (wOBA) when ahead this season (at .577), and since 2015, only New York Yankee slugger Aaron Judge (.535) has had a higher wOBA than Trout’s (.524) when ahead.
Trout’s patience has beaten many pitchers, but it may also offer a roadmap for a pitcher to gain an edge on baseball’s best hitter. If Trout has one weakness this season, it’s that he’s actually worse than the major league average (.225 wOBA) when behind in the count (.215) .

And since Trout rarely swings at first pitches, pitchers may be better off throwing a strike right away to get ahead in the count. While some hitters are becoming more aggressive early in counts ostensibly to take advantage of pitches to hit, Trout benefits from his patience, and the only sure way to get ahead in the count is to take the first pitch. Trout has always been more effective when he’s ahead than when he swings at the first pitch.
The Baseball-Reference.com metric sOPS+ measures a player’s splits against the league’s overall performance within specific splits, with 100 marking an average performance. Trout has a 194 sOPS+ when ahead in the count this season, compared with 141 on the first pitch. (When behind, it’s an 86.)
Few batters are as patient as Trout, and very few, if any, have his physical gifts. That combination has given Trout a compounding and — from the pitchers’ perspective — seemingly unfair advantage.

10th week
The mass demonstrations in Hong Kong — which were started over a controversial extradition bill which would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China to stand trial, undermining Hong Kong’s freedoms, per its critics — have entered their 10th week. Over the weekend, police “fired teargas across the city” and shot rubber bullets, and protestors threw petrol bombs and bricks at police who were charging them with batons. [BBC]
40 billion times the sun
Astronomers have discovered the most massive black hole ever observed, in a galaxy called Holm 15A in the constellation Cetus some 700 million light years from Earth. A conservative estimate puts the black hole at 40 billion times more massive than our sun. There is also a black hole at the center of our Milky Way, but it is a pathetically puny 4 million times more massive than the sun. [MIT Technology Review]
$70,000 per minute
That’s how much money the Walmart-owning Walton family has made in the year since Bloomberg’s previous list of the world’s richest families. The Waltons top that list this year, with wealth of $190.5 billion. The Mars, Koch, Al Saud and Wertheimer (of the Chanel fashion house) families round out a top five. The 25 richest families in the world control $1.4 trillion, a figure which is up nearly a quarter from last year. [Bloomberg]
2 flips, 3 twists
All hail Simone Biles. The American gymnast etched herself even deeper in the annals of the sport recently, becoming the first woman in competition in the floor exercise to land a triple double — that’s two flips with three twists. She attempted another first later that same night: a double-double dismount, off of a balance beam, which she landed “with a slight hop.” The only trouble is that Biles already has two innovations named after her; they’re both, of course, called the Biles.

4 books
Four books by the late J.D. Salinger — “The Catcher in the Rye,” “Nine Stories,” “Franny and Zooey” and “Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction” — will be available for the first time on Tuesday as e-books. Salinger’s son has long insisted that other, as-yet-unpublished work by his father will also see the light of day, but that such an event may still be years away. [Associated Press]
50 meteors per hour
We’re going to fly through a bunch of space junk tonight and tomorrow, a fact which will manifest itself to us, the passengers of Spaceship Earth, as the Perseid meteor shower. Specifically, the Perseids happens as the Earth “passes through the debris trail of the comet Swift-Tuttle.” Peaking tonight and tomorrow night, some from a dozen to 50 meteors per hour will be visible to gazers across the U.S. [The Washington Post]

https://fivethirtyeight.com/sitemap-7.xml,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-raptors-arent-a-major-contender-but-that-doesnt-mean-they-arent-interesting/,2019-08-12,,,features,"Aug. 12, 2019",The Raptors Aren’t A Major Contender. But That Doesn’t Mean They Aren’t Interesting.,Chris Herring,FiveThirtyEight,NBA,"After losing superstar Kawhi Leonard in free agency last month, it’s highly unlikely that the Raptors will repeat as NBA champions in 2020. But on some level, Leonard’s departure could make Toronto the league’s most interesting club this season.
The team was an impressive 17-5 during the regular season1 when Leonard sat out. The Raptors play in the weaker of the two conferences, and might be looking at an Eastern Conference in which three or four rosters, at most, will enter the campaign clearly more fortified than their own. Forward Pascal Siakam showed signs last year of being a burgeoning star and now, without the ball-dominant Leonard, will likely be asked to do far more on the offensive end.
There’s an additional aspect of the Raptors worth watching. The team has a number of solid vets on the team who are headed into the final season of their contracts, leaving Toronto in a spot where it could push as far as possible for a playoff run, or, if its ceiling becomes obvious, pivot and trade to bolster their future.
If Toronto is to exceed expectations again, Siakam — the league’s Most Improved Player — would almost certainly have to take another step (or spin move) forward by becoming the team’s No. 1 offensive option. And while there are some metrics that inspire confidence on that front — his field-goal percentage last season, for example, was almost as good without Leonard on the court as it was with him2 — there are a handful of things to look for, and perhaps even some reasons to doubt that another seismic leap is on the way. For starters, his usage rate last season, at just under 21 percent, was one of the NBA’s lowest among those who averaged 15 or more points per game. His usage will almost certainly need to increase, which could then dent his efficiency. (As a sidenote: This concept is what made Leonard’s ascent in San Antonio so incredible. His usage spiked, but he was somehow just as efficient despite taking on more offensive responsibility.)
Though it seems easy enough to accept the notion that Siakam will need to shoot more, it’s worth considering at least two more things. First, he’ll likely see each team’s best defender now that Leonard is gone; and secondly, without Leonard, he won’t be able to play off the ball as much.
The second factor is significant because of where Siakam is most comfortable shooting. He developed into a solid 3-point shooter from the corners — where he could hang out while sharing the floor with Leonard and All-Star Kyle Lowry — last year, at better than 41 percent. But Toronto’s need for him to handle the ball,3 especially in screen-and-roll scenarios, will likely put Siakam at the top of the key more often, which complicates things since he shot just 27 percent from above the arc, tied for the NBA’s 10th-worst mark.4
If Siakam isn’t quite ready for the role of a lead scorer night in and night out, it helps that the Raptors are a team that often thrived without relying too heavily on one player throughout most of the 2018-19 regular season. Of course, Leonard was an enormous part of that and picked up all the necessary slack come playoff time. But no other club enjoyed such a variety of players driving to the basket. Backup point guard Fred VanVleet shone in the later stages of the postseason and can play with the starters at times to help ease the ball-handling responsibilities on Siakam and Lowry.
One other key in all this: Toronto may not have to score all that much. Yes, Leonard and Danny Green were huge contributors to the Raptors, who ranked in the top five in effective field goal percentage defense. But even without those two, Toronto enjoys a pretty solid defensive core that can still orchestrate switches (they were this postseason’s most efficient switch defense by a mile) and reliably step up in help scenarios, while Lowry is one of the best charge-takers in the game. OG Anunoby, who missed the playoffs after an emergency appendectomy, will be integral in replacing Green on that end. Aside from him, Toronto picked up a pair of free-agent wings in Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Stanley Johnson, who underwhelmed in their initial stops after being taken in the first round of the 2015 draft, but are low-risk gambles for a team that’s looking for more young talent to put around Siakam.
In a way, Hollis-Jefferson and Johnson being under the microscope is emblematic of the team as a whole. Team president Masai Ujiri is going to want to take constant stock of just how good this team is to get a sense of how he should handle things come February, when his phone figures to be ringing off the hook ahead of the trade deadline. Lowry, VanVleet, Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka are all set to be free agents next summer,5 and could appeal to teams seeking to make the sort of magical run Toronto did last season.
Barring an injury or something else unforeseen, the Raptors should still have more than enough to make the playoffs this season. FiveThirtyEight’s projection model gives them an 85 percent probability of reaching the postseason, and a 4 percent chance of reaching the NBA Finals. But it will be even more interesting to see exactly where Ujiri’s dividing line falls, between deciding that it’s worth pursuing another deep playoff run versus selling off assets to pivot toward the future.",200,2019-11-13T01:15:54.371740Z

Kamala Harris got a big surge in both public support and media attention. But with the second debate now over, Harris has lost most of the support that she had gained in the polls and, according to last week’s data from the TV News Archive1 and Media Cloud,2 she has also started to slide out of the media spotlight. Harris was mentioned in about 9 percent of all cable news clips that mentioned any Democratic 2020 candidate last week across the three networks we monitor — CNN, Fox News and MSNBC — and she was mentioned in about 19 percent of online news stories that mentioned any candidate. That’s about half as big a share as she had in the previous week and similar to the amount she was being mentioned in the week before the first debate.

But Harris was not the only candidate getting less media attention last week. Several other candidates, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, Marianne Williamson, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Rep. John Delaney all slid backwards after post-debate bumps two weeks ago. While most candidates saw some reduction in their share of mentions, Sen. Cory Booker’s media coverage stayed about the same from the previous week. And former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke got a lot more media attention following the shooting in his home district where more than 20 people were killed. Speaking from El Paso last week, O’Rourke was vocally critical of President Trump, linking the shooting to Trump’s racist rhetoric. Ultimately though, former Vice President Joe Biden remained the most-mentioned candidate in both cable and online news, as well as the leader in the polls.
