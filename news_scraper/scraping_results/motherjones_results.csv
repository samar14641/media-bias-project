He’s a Democrat in one of the reddest corners of the Deep South. And when he goes up for reelection on Saturday, polls show, the same voters who backed Donald Trump by nearly 20 points in 2016 could very well send him to victory.
“If you try and filter this through a national or partisan filter, you’ll find that not a lot of things add up,” explains Stephen Handwerk, executive director of the Louisiana Democratic Party.
In the era of impeachment, Medicare for All, and an insurgent left wing, is there still room for a staunch pro-lifer in the Democratic Party? To answer that question, there’s no better test case in the country than the political fate of John Bel Edwards.
Edwards, who has served as governor since 2016, faces Republican challenger Eddie Rispone in Saturday’s election, which is technically a runoff between the two candidates. Louisiana has a “jungle primary” system, where the top two finishers irrespective of political party advance to a runoff if no candidate gets a majority of the vote. Edwards comfortably led the field of candidates in the October 12 primary but barely failed to reach 50 percent, sending him into the November 16 runoff. Edwards and Rispone are neck and neck in the polls, with Edwards maintaining a small lead within the margin of error.
Edwards’ win in the 2015 governor’s race was seen as something of a fluke. He succeeded in tying his opponent, then-Sen. David Vitter, to the deeply unpopular outgoing Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, and focused the election on Vitter’s past involvement with a prostitute. As governor, Edwards has overseen a massive expansion of Medicaid, criminal justice reform efforts aimed at reducing Louisiana’s high incarceration rate, and one of the most restrictive bans on abortion in the country. Now Edwards, the lone Democratic governor in the Deep South, is going up against Rispone, a conservative businessman with Trump’s backing.
His stance on abortion would probably doom him in California or New York or Illinois, but Louisiana is not those places. Handwerk, who has worked in Louisiana politics for the past 30 years, believes that Edwards’ lack of conformity to the national Democratic platform won’t be an issue for Democrats in the state.“The vast majority of voters are considering this holistically,” he says. “I don’t think it’s surprising to anyone in the state the vast diversity of opinion that we have on abortion and all things revolving around that.”
That doesn’t mean Handwerk or other party activists agree with Edwards’ position on abortion. Edwards’ record as an anti-abortion Democrat goes back to his time in the state legislature. In 2010, Edwards voted in favor of a law that barred insurance offered through an Obamacare exchange from covering elective abortions and stated that “human life begins at conception.” As governor, Edwards ramped up his anti-abortion policies, signing into law a so-called “fetal heartbeat” bill, which banned abortion when a heartbeat can be detected, generally around six weeks. Many people aren’t even aware of their pregnancy at that time. The law did not create exemptions for rape and incest, making it one of the harshest abortions bans in the country.
Sally O. Donlon, an assistant dean at the University Louisiana at Lafayette and a member of the Lafayette branch of the Louisiana Democratic Party, recalls the betrayal many of Edwards’ female supporters felt when he signed the heartbeat bill into law. “After his signing of the recent so-called heartbeat bill giving preferential treatment to a clump of cells over fully actualized women, we were very angry, and a lot of us came out and said that we would never support him,” she says.
However, she says, many of those women changed their tune when faced with the choice between Edwards and Rispone, a staunch conservative who has said he wants to freeze enrollment in the state’s Medicaid program, a move that could leave hundreds of thousands of low-income Louisianans uninsured.
“In the end, all of the Democratic women I know are active in phone banking for [Edwards] and rallies and everything like that,” Donlon says, “because reproductive rights are not our only issue.”
Edwards’ opposition to abortion might not sink him, but it’s also not clear that it will actually help him on Saturday, even in the state with the highest share of people who support a total ban on abortion. “It’s an impediment to a strong relationship with Democratic activists,” says Robert Mann, a political historian at Louisiana State University. “What’s left of Democrats in Louisiana tend to be liberal Democrats. The moderate Democrats, a lot of them have been picked off or gravitated over to the other side, and so it does make Edwards’ position look a little more out of touch with rank-and-file Democrats.”
Edwards, a devout Roman Catholic, has never shied away from discussing how his faith has influenced his political beliefs. In a 2015 campaign video, he and his wife Donna discussed the moment their daughter was diagnosed with spina bifida, a birth defect that can cause fluid in the brain and various mobility issues. The doctors encouraged Donna to have an abortion about 20 weeks into her pregnancy, but the couple decided not to end the pregnancy, a decision Edwards says was influenced by his belief that “God has a purpose in everything.” Edwards later explained in an interview that he told this story to show voters that his position on abortion was “sincere” and not politically motivated.
Although the two candidates have similar positions on abortion, access to health care is a major point of contention between them. On his first day in office, Edwards signed into law a massive expansion of the state’s Medicaid program. A survey conducted by Louisiana State University found that the uninsured rate among adults fell by half between 2015 and 2017, from 22.7 percent to 11.4 percent. Rispone has argued that Louisiana’s Medicaid program is rampant with wasteful spending. In the candidates’ most recent debate, Rispone declared that he would “freeze” enrollment into Medicaid in the state until he could eliminate what he considers useless spending—a move Edwards argues would eventually force 300,000 people from the state-based Medicaid program.
If Edwards’ pro-life stance is hurting him among the national Democratic donor class, it doesn’t show in his fundraising numbers. He has raised more than $14 million, up from $10 million in his last gubernatorial campaign. That includes more than $2 million from out-of-state contributors, compared to roughly $600,000 in 2015. Edwards has narrowly out-raised Rispone, even though $11 million of the $13 million Rispone has raised has come from his personal wealth.
While Edwards may not be struggling financially, Mann worries that his message may be falling flat with black voters, who comprise 57 percent of registered Democrats in Louisiana. Based on historical voting patterns, Mann estimates that, in order to win, Edwards will need roughly 95 percent of black voters who show up to support him, in addition to 30 percent of white voters. Given the overwhelming support of Louisiana African Americans for Democrats, the key for Edwards is really turnout. (In 2015, Edwards benefited from higher turnout in majority-black precincts and lower turnout in whiter ones than in previous elections.) In the October 12th primary, black voter turnout hovered around 38 percent, nearly 12 points below white turnout.
Edwards’ moderate and conservative positions on some issues are unlikely to excite many of the state’s black voters, and his rhetoric might not help either. Edwards praised Trump—who is extremely unpopular among African Americans—in the wake of massive flood damage in 2016, and he has prominently featured law enforcement officials in his campaign ads. “[Edwards is] a pro-life, pro-gun, pro-law enforcement, too-conservative Democrat who gets along well with Donald Trump,” says Mann.
Saturday will serve as a test of Edwards’ strategy: Can a Democrat appear tough on crime and still turn out enough black voters, and win over female supporters after signing one of the strictest abortion bans in country? In a party that is increasingly moving to the left, Edwards surely doesn’t fit the national mold. But for Southern Democrats, says Mann, it’s still par for the course. “There’s no such thing as a perfect candidate,” he says. “Every election is a choice between two imperfect people. It’s always a lesser of two evils.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/election-vendors-security/,2019-11-12,,,politics,10 hours ago,How America’s Election Machines are Vulnerable to Foreign Manipulation,AJ Vicens,MotherJones,Politics,"Election security has garnered a lot of attention in the wake of Russian’s 2016 influence operation. In particular, concerns over the reliability and integrity of voting machines—long a subject of considerable attention in hacker and tech circles—has made its way into the mainstream, prompting many states and local jurisdictions to upgrade equipment.
But the vendors who make, sell, and service the equipment that make elections work—the voting machines, voter registration databases, ballot programming software, and electronic poll books—largely fly under the radar with little oversight, according to a new report from the Brennan Center, leaving United States elections unnecessarily vulnerable to foreign interference.
“There is almost no federal regulation of the vendors that design and maintain the systems that allow us to determine who can vote, how they vote, or how their votes are counted,” write coauthors Larry Norden, Christopher Deluzio, and Gowri Ramachandran in their new report, “A Framework for Election Vendor Oversight,” published Tuesday. The trio notes that even though such systems were designated as “critical infrastructure” by the federal government in the wake of 2016, the vendors who design and sell them face less regulation than those who produce colored pencils.
“There’s been little attention paid to vendor practices, and election system vendors are responsible for a big part of whether or not our elections are secure,” Norden told Mother Jones ahead of the report’s release. Private companies that work in other critical areas face a bevy of regulation and have to meet a variety of standards, he said, and election vendors should too.
Currently, only “voting systems” are tested and certified by the Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency created in the wake of the 2000 presidential race recount in Florida. The standards were adopted in 2005 and cover the hardware and software that prepare voting machines and ballots, test them, record and count votes, report results, and produce audit data. Although the vast majority of states require voting equipment to pass this certification, the process is voluntary. That level of independence has its roots in America’s constitutionally proscribed history of having states control their own elections.
But an even bigger issue for the report’s authors is that today’s voluntary standards fail to place key requirements on vendors, such as background checks for personnel, transparency in ownership, and approaches to supply chain security. “The threats posed by foreign influence over a US election vendor—including the heightened potential for foreign infiltration of the vendor’s supply chain or knowledge of client election officials’ capabilities and systems—should be obvious,” the authors wrote.
The authors suggest a few fundamental shifts, including greater funding and authority for the EAC to address such concerns. Despite the likelihood of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, the agency’s 2019 budget was just $9.2 million, down from $18 million in 2010. While the report says the EAC could require more of vendors on its own with current resources, the report calls for more funding to help the agency to expand its cybersecurity expertise, and for Congress to exercise greater oversight of its work, rather than, as Republicans have several times, try to kill it.
Norden says local election officials would be able to make better decisions if vendors had to provide more information about their cybersecurity practices, ownership structure, or the way they work with subcontractors.
“I don’t mean to bash the vendors, I just think everybody would be better off if there were national standards and there was transparency about what they were doing,” Norden said, pointing to a situation in 2016 where VR Systems, a Florida-based provider of electronic registration books and other election services, was apparently hacked—an incident where the details and repercussions are still not publicly clear.
Norden says that other election security proposals—some of which include proposals reflected in the report—have stalled in Congress at the feet of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who says that states should have most of the control and responsibility over election security.
“Unfortunately, what we’ve learned with Congress around these issues is that you need a crisis before they’re willing to act,” Norden said. He pointed to last week’s indictment of two former Twitter employees accused of spying for Saudi Arabia while on the job as a very real and recent example of how technology companies can be penetrated by foreign interests.
“I hope that we don’t have a situation like that where we find out that we have people working at one of the vendors that was also working for a foreign government,” he said. “It’s not an impossible thing to imagine. We have too many precedents to think that couldn’t happen given how important our election vendors are, and given how damaging their attack could be to our election security. So I hope we don’t have to get to that point.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But the justices’ decision could wind up having little impact on the roughly 700,000 immigrants, known as Dreamers, whose lives President Donald Trump has tried to upend.
Instead, the winner of the next presidential election may be the one who decides whether Dreamers—along with another about 300,000 people with temporary legal status—face possible deportation. For roughly 1 million undocumented immigrants, what happens in 2020 could wind up being more important than what happened in 2016.
It is not disputed that the Trump administration has the authority to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—the Obama-era policy that protects Dreamers—since it’s an executive action, not a law passed by Congress. The legal argument against Trump’s 2017 move to end DACA is that the decision violated the law because it was made in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner. Lower courts and the progressive Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals have agreed with that position, forcing the Trump administration to keep DACA on life support. More than 660,000 people are still protected by DACA as a result.
The Supreme Court isn’t expected to issue a decision in the case until 2020, meaning that DACA recipients who renew their two-year work permits before a ruling is issued could retain their DACA status well into 2022. A Democratic president could reinstate the program long before then, even if the court rules that Trump’s DACA decision was legal.
Immigrants with temporary protected status—a protection granted to people in the United States whose countries are affected by war or natural disasters—face a similar predicament. The Trump administration has tried to end those protections for six countries, but it’s been blocked in court, leaving roughly 300,000 immigrants—the majority of whom have been in the United States for roughly two decades—with work permits until at least January 2020. A new administration could quickly reverse Trump’s TPS decisions before those people have been deported. It’s entirely possible that DACA recipients and TPS holders, two of the administration’s biggest and most obvious targets, could escape a Trump presidency without losing protections against deportation. (The attempts to end those protections, however, have caused psychological distress and turmoil as immigrants wonder whether they’ll be able to stay in the United States.)
But there is one big caveat in the DACA case. As Vox points out, Trump’s Justice Department is arguing that the whole policy is illegal. Most of the debate around DACA so far, including in the lower courts, has been over whether the administration made an arbitrary and capricious decision, and the Supreme Court could well rule on that narrow question, but it doesn’t have to. The five conservative justices could instead find that the Obama administration didn’t have the authority to protect hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants through executive action. A Democratic president would then be blocked from reviving DACA.
Such a sweeping decision would highlight what may be the most profound legacy of the 2016 election on a wide array of issues, including immigration: not the administration’s executive actions, but its appointment of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z
https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/the-democrats-impeachment-strategy-is-simple-and-risky/,2019-11-12,,,politics,12 hours ago,The Democrats’ Impeachment Strategy Is Simple—and Risky,David Corn,MotherJones,Impeachment,"Less is more.
That’s the mantra for the House Democrats, as they take their impeachment inquiry into a new phase: public hearings. For weeks, the House committees leading this effort—the intelligence, foreign affairs, and oversight committees—have narrowly focused on one matter: the Trump-Ukraine scandal and the tale of Donald Trump apparently abusing the office of the president to obtain political dirt that could influence the 2020 election. Sure, there are a lot of other issues that Democrats have previously raised as possible grounds for impeachment—Trump allegedly obstructing justice (per the Robert Mueller report), Trump regularly violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution, Trump separating children from their parents at the border, and more—but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team determined that their best bet was to zero in on one episode of wrongdoing and leave the rest alone. “It’s the KISS strategy,” one senior House Democratic staffer says. “Keep it simple, stupid.” And as one House Democrat puts it, the goal is a “medium-sized impeachment.” Nothing too elaborate, nothing too hard to follow. After the somewhat complicated Trump-Russia scandal fizzled politically, Pelosi and her crew want to base impeachment on a straightforward and comprehensible narrative. Avoid tangential plots and the need for timelines, flowcharts, and complex explanations. Don’t get hung up on the past and the 2016 election. Skip all the Russia stuff—and don’t mention Mueller ever again. Trump tried to extort a foreign government to screw with the upcoming election—and that’s impeachable enough.
So far, this impeachment-lite strategy appears to be working in that public opinion polls show majority support for the Democrats’ impeachment project. But it does run a risk of providing Republicans in the Senate, who will have to render a judgment if the House Democrats successfully impeach Trump, what could be an easy way out.
Through the first eight months of 2019, Pelosi resisted the mounting calls within her own caucus for impeachment. Though there were solid arguments for initiating such a proceeding—including Trump’s refusal to comply with congressional investigations (which was one of the three articles of impeachment passed by the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 pertaining to Richard Nixon)—Pelosi and other top Democrats feared that the 41 House Democrats representing congressional districts where Trump won in 2016 could face the wrath of voters if they voted to impeach a president a majority of their constituents had chosen. And that could threaten Democratic control of the House. The Dems also had concluded that the Russia investigation was no longer of much interest to many voters and that Mueller’s report and his half-hearted testimony before Congress had not established a solid foundation for the argument that Trump should be removed from office. To some degree, this was a result of the Democrats’ own failure to convey the full and compelling narrative of that scandal. They held no series of hearings on the matter. They never figured out how to sidestep Trump’s trap, in which he defined the controversy as being only a matter of direct collusion. They blew an important opportunity. Even when it was reported that Trump, abandoning his constitutional duty to safeguard the nation, had told Moscow’s emissary during a May 2017 Oval Office meeting that he didn’t care about Russia’s attack on the 2016 campaign, there was no organized outrage from the Democrats’ leaders. They had decided voters didn’t care about that whole Russia thing, and impeachment was off the table.
The Ukraine revelations changed all that. When the news broke that Trump had pressured the Ukrainian president to mount investigations to produce dirt on Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and to yield information that would buttress a crackpot conspiracy theory holding that Russia did not hack the 2016 election, the impeachment damn in the House broke, and Pelosi and her colleagues essentially said, Now we got him. Quid pro quo, extortion, bribery. All summed up in one line: “I would like you to do us a favor though.” Despite the obfuscation, diversion, and distraction hurled by Trump and his cultist defenders, this caper was indeed a simple story. The quasi-transcript released by the White House implicated Trump—and all the subsequent evidence and accounts backed up the main accusation that Trump had exploited his office to muscle a foreign leader for his own underhanded political advantage. At this point, Pelosi grabbed on to these disclosures and declared, This is something we can work with!
Within the House Democratic caucus there was—and there continues to be—a debate over whether the impeachment of Donald Trump also ought to include other matters. Should the Democrats showcase the Ukraine affair as an example of Trump’s perfidy and tie it to the other abuses his critics have identified long before anyone knew the name of Volodomyr Zelensky? Or should they not pile on side plots and additional charges of constitutional wrongdoing? This conversation is continuing among Democrats within the House. And it is partly colored by pragmatic concerns. Pelosi and other leading Dems are looking to pursue an expeditious impeachment. Get this thing done with ASAP so voters don’t come to see the Democrats as bent only on revenge and obstructionism—and so any Senate trial isn’t pushed too far into the coming election year. With the holidays approaching, the House doesn’t have many working days in order to wrap up an impeachment. A one-story-only impeachment has a better chance of being accomplished in this short timeframe. Explaining Trump’s violation of the emoluments clause, his various alleged acts of obstruction, and everything else—through further congressional investigation, reports, hearings, and the lawsuits necessary to force recalcitrant witnesses and the White House to comply with congressional subpoenas—would take time. Perhaps a lot of time. (There is so much to cover!) So if the best impeachment is a fast impeachment, then the Dems need a compact short story to present to the public, not a grand sweeping epic. Call it a modest impeachment. There is still a chance the more-than-Ukraine Democrats will somehow attach Trump’s other misdeeds to the impeachment train. But time and the desire for simplicity is against them.
One curious aspect of the political dynamic underlying a no-frills impeachment is that this just-the-Ukraine-facts approach could also help Trump and the Republicans. Already Trump’s defenders have moved toward an is-this-all-you-got defense, with some Republicans conceding the Ukraine business doesn’t look good but insisting it’s not impeachable. Look for this to become a mainstay for Trump’s champions: the Democrats have been investigating Trump for almost a year, and all they turned up was one lousy phone call with perhaps one teeny-weeny quid pro quo. They will contend that such a misstep—if it even counts as a misstep—does not warrant overturning the popular will (that is, the Electoral College). And they will combine this with another obvious argument: certainly, this possible error ought not lead to the political death penalty in an election year when the American people themselves will soon be able to render their own verdict. Should Trump be impeached and a trial be held in the Senate, you can expect Republican senators to loftily proclaim that they will not substitute their own judgments for the wisdom of the voters. And the closer any trial comes to Election Day 2020, the louder this argument will be exclaimed.
There are obvious counters to these obvious Republican defenses. (Why allow a president who has used his office to try to subvert an election to remain in office?) But a medium-sized impeachment—one that ducks the totality of Trump’s misconduct—could provide the Republicans greater opportunity to fast-track a trial, quickly dismiss the entire mess, and offer what Trump will embrace as a clean bill of health. Still, if that’s the scenario that plays out, Trump will be stained—and perhaps so will some Republican senators who stick with him (depending on how the case is presented). Yet at this stage, there is no telling what the ramifications will be for the 2020 election. You can now game out it assorted ways—it helps Trump, it hurts Trump, it makes no difference. This election is likely to be shaken, rocked, and rolled by a variety of factors that no one, no matter how strong a sense of imagination they possess, can predict at this point.
With time running out, Pelosi and the House Democrats are going into a historic political battle with the impeachment they have. It’s too late for them to rewind and rerun the past eight months to set up a more comprehensive case. They have decided that to go big—what’s bigger in American politics than a presidential impeachment?—they must go small.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Warren’s “corporate perjury” law would subject corporate representatives who lie to federal regulators to fines and possible jail time.
The longstanding false narrative Exxon told, before finally acknowledging human-caused climate change in 2014, is exactly the type of misinformation regime the policy was created to combat. “That is corruption, plain and simple,” says Warren campaign spokesperson Saloni Sharma. “Elizabeth’s plan to end Washington corruption will prosecute companies for perjury when they knowingly engage in egregious and intentional efforts to mislead the public and prevent our government from understanding and acting on the facts.”
Perjury is an infamously difficult crime to prove, requiring the exhaustion of any possibility that a false statement was simply made in error. But under Warren’s proposal, if prosecutors successfully charge someone with lying to regulators on behalf of a corporation, the perpetrator could face up to $250,000 and time behind bars.
Right now, Exxon is locked in a court battle in New York with the state attorney general, who alleges that Exxon executives committed fraud by providing incongruent narratives to shareholders and the public. To the former, it minimized the threat and relevance of climate change, while assuring the latter it was tackling the climate issue head on. In this case, Warren’s anti-perjury policy could have bolstered the state’s investigation against Exxon, considering the amount of time the company spent publicly denying its role in climate change.
This proposal is part of a wider set of initiatives the campaign has set forth to prevent corporations from lying to the public. Last month, Warren called for barring federal entities from considering research that was not peer reviewed or was funded by an industry. In her proposal, Warren noted that industry groups habitually peddle misleading information to secure laws and regulations that benefit them. “I’ll crack down on corporations who manipulate agencies by submitting sham research — like the climate denial studies bought and paid for by oil and gas magnates like the Koch Brothers,” her proposal states.
Warren has long targeted corporate-backed research. In 2015, a Brookings Institution economist named Robert Litan resigned from his post after Warren revealed that he’d received $38,000 to promote research critical of Obama-era regulations to protect investors.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

That’s the big takeaway from dramatic courtroom testimony that occurred Tuesday in the trial of Roger Stone.
The revelations came from Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide who took the stand as federal prosecutors wrapped up their case against Stone, the longtime Trump adviser who was charged with lying to Congress about his efforts to interact with WikiLeaks in 2016. In court, Gates described a July 31, 2016, phone call he witnessed while in the car with Trump headed to LaGuardia Airport—nine days after WikiLeaks had dumped tens of thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee. Gates said he could not hear what Stone was saying, but saw Stone’s number on Trump’s caller ID and recognized Stone’s voice. After the call, Trump “indicated that more information would be coming” out, Gates testified.
Gates’ testimony contradicts Stone’s claim to the House Intelligence Committee that he did not communicate with anyone on the Trump campaign about information he claimed to have gathered regarding WikiLeaks’ plans to release hacked Democratic information. But more significantly, it calls into question Trump’s assertions to Mueller’s team. In written responses to the prosecutors last year, Trump stated, “I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with [Stone], nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign.” Trump also told Mueller: “I do not recall being told during the campaign that Roger Stone or anyone associated with my campaign had discussions with any of the entities named in the question [including WikiLeaks] regarding the content or timing of release of hacked emails.”
Gates’ testimony suggests Trump was in direct communication with Stone about WikiLeaks. Gates’ statements to the court also indicate that Trump received updates on what Stone was telling other campaign officials about WikiLeaks. His testimony depicts Trump and his campaign as trying to use Stone as something of a go-between with WikiLeaks to obtain inside information they presumably could exploit. (Throughout the campaign, Trump and his aides repeatedly denied Russia was attacking the election, but Mueller’s final report did note the campaign attempted to take advantage of this attack.)
Gates revealed on Tuesday that Stone began telling Trump campaign officials early in the campaign that WikiLeaks was preparing to release material damaging to Hillary Clinton. Gates said Stone told him in April that information would be coming out via WikiLeaks. That was long before the Democratic National Committee announced on June 14 that it had been hacked by Russia.
Gates testified that after the DNC announcement, Stone contacted him, saying the matter was urgent. Stone reported to Gates that “more information would be coming out of the DNC hack,” according to Gates, and Stone asked Gates to give him contact information for Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and another campaign aide so he could brief them on the hack. (This was several days after Kushner, Donald Trump Jr., and Paul Manafort, then the campaign chair, had met with a Russian emissary whom they were told was bringing them dirt on Clinton as part of a Kremlin scheme to assist the Trump campaign. They later claimed the meeting had not yielded any ammo they could use against Clinton.)
Throughout June and into July, Stone continued to tell top Trump aides that WikiLeaks would be releasing material harmful for Clinton. Gates said that he and Manafort were skeptical. But on July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks put out the hacked DNC emails, disrupting the party’s convention and prompting the resignation of the DNC chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.
Gates said the Trump campaign was thrilled with these developments. Gates said that Stone was quick to inform the campaign that he had been right and that Stone continued to predict that more releases were coming from WikiLeaks. Gates testified that Manafort asked him to follow up with Stone to find out when that new information would appear. “Manafort indicated that he was going to be updating additional people on the campaign, including the candidate,” Gates said, referring to Trump. If Manafort did talk to Trump about imminent WikiLeaks releases, that would be further indication that Trump misled Mueller.
In his written responses to Mueller, Trump claimed, somewhat implausibly, that he did not recall any such conversations with Stone, Manafort, or anyone else—rather than denying that such discussions had occurred. That could protect him from perjury charges after he leaves office. (It’s tough for prosecutors to prove that someone did, in fact, remember an event.) But Gates’ testimony is strong evidence that the president lied to Mueller to cover up a possible Trump campaign connection to WikiLeaks and to hide interactions that Trump might have feared could be seen as something akin to collusion.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

On Tuesday, the Southern Poverty Law Center published excerpts of emails Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s assaults on immigrants, sent to the right-wing outlet Breitbart. Miller’s embrace of ideas and language used by the “white replacement” conspiracy theorists who populate alt-right forums has long been known. But the unusual thing about the emails, which were provided to the SPLC by a disaffected former Breitbart editor, Katie McHugh, is that they come from a time when Miller was willing to put his ideas in writing. These days, well aware that he’s a target for Trump’s critics, he’s careful to avoid a paper trail by sticking to phone calls.
In a normal administration, the views laid out in Miller’s emails would be disqualifying. In a Trump administration, it makes him essential. In fact, many of the opinions he laid out in the emails have become part of the policies Miller has helped enact in the White House, from cutting refugee admissions to record lows to separating families at the border.
The SPLC has laid out the full range of Miller’s views disclosed in his emails on its Hatewatch blog. But here are a few of the most incendiary elements:
Comparing the pope’s rhetoric to a racist fever dream
In September 2015, while working for then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Miller wrote to McHugh:
As I wrote last year, The Camp of the Saints is a 1973 French novel that’s become a favorite among white nationalist for obvious reasons:
Raging at Amazon for pulling Confederate flags
After nine parishioners at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church were murdered in 2015, Amazon, eBay, and Walmart moved to stop selling Confederate flags. Miller responded by quoting History.com to McHugh under the subject line “defies modern comprehension”:
The fact that those men died in defense of slavery did not seem to matter to Miller.
When it came to the more practical matter of directing Breitbart’s coverage, Miller recommended that McHugh go on Amazon to find “commie flags” that were still for sale.
Celebrating a eugenicist president
Like his former boss, Sessions, Miller admires the 1924 immigration law that favored Northern Europeans and dramatically cut immigration until it was replaced in 1965. In the emails, Miller frequently praised Calvin Coolidge, the president who signed the law, who has become a hero to anti-immigration activists on the far right. He wrote during Immigrant Heritage Month in June 2015:
As the Atlantic has shown, Coolidge’s views about immigrants are best captured by an article he wrote for Good Housekeeping in 1921:",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended the coal industry and shown indifference to climate change, even as extreme heat has intensified the fires blazing in his country.

Matt Bevin makes his final campaign push, he has hammered a message that has been central to his effort to win a second term: Elect him because he will do anything and everything to outlaw abortion in the state.
“4 Legislative Sessions > > > 10 #ProLife Bills,” Bevin tweeted from his official gubernatorial account last Wednesday, with a video of the governor holding babies. “The sanctity of human life should NOT be controversial, and our administration is committed to protecting it.” Later that afternoon, he tweeted a video of a 2018 appearance on Fox News, along with a message that read, in part, “we will ALWAYS fight against the barbaric and gruesome practice of live dismemberment abortion, which seeks to undermine and devalue the sanctity of human life.”
Bevin is locked in a toss-up ahead of next week’s election. The only recent public opinion poll of the race showed the Republican incumbent tied with his opponent, current Attorney General Andy Beshear.
Democrats long dominated state politics post-Reconstruction, but the political climate there has been trending Republican for decades, and Bevin shouldn’t have to sweat reelection. Yet his political future is on the line largely because he spent the past four years seemingly offending whomever he could in the state—especially the state’s public school teachers, who Bevin has repeatedly clashed with over his effort to overhaul the state’s pension system. He has even tangled with members of his own party. A Republican state senator hosted a “Bullied by Bevin” picnic earlier this summer, and Bevin’s own lieutenant governor filed a lawsuit against him for firing her staff. Morning Consult polls consistently ranked him as the least popular governor in the country, until October when he inched up a spot.
But Bevin is relying on his anti-abortion bona fides to try to win back supporters in the socially conservative state.
Bevin has never been shy about mixing religion and politics, coming out strongly behind Kim Davis during his 2015 gubernatorial campaign when the Kentucky town clerk became a national figure for refusing to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples. (Once he became governor, Bevin appeased Davis by ending the state’s requirement that the names of county clerks appear on marriage licenses.) In early October, he tweeted support for “Bring Your Bible to School Day,” an event created by Focus on the Family, the James Dobson–founded organization that pushes social conservative causes. In an accompanying video, he said, “I would encourage you, please, don’t just bring your Bible to school, but read your Bible. Bring it, share it with others. If you have an extra Bible, bring it and share it with somebody who doesn’t have one, who maybe has never read this book.”
It’s fighting abortion rights where his zeal most shines through. Since taking over the governor’s mansion, he’s been hell-bent on restricting reproductive rights. Once he was joined by a Republican majority legislature in 2017, they teamed up to pass a wave of anti-abortion restrictions that Bevin eagerly signed into law. “Kentucky Now Has Some of the Toughest Anti-Abortion Laws in the Country,” a Planned Parenthood press release read earlier this year. Bevin has proudly owned that dubious distinction. “When you are the governor,” Bevin said at a Right to Life rally in Frankfort this year, “you are accused of many things. But one of the things that I take great pride [in] is being accused of being the most pro-life governor in America. I love it. Who would want to be anything other than pro-life?”
Shortly after taking office, Bevin exploited regulatory rules to shutter the lone abortion provider in Lexington, Kentucky’s second-largest city. That left EMW Women’s Surgical Center in Louisville as the sole clinic offering abortions in the state. The clinic has persistently fought Bevin in court to remain open. “All the laws that we’ve been challenging are patently and obviously unconstitutional,” says Heather Gatnarek, an ACLU lawyer who has been representing EMW.
The ACLU currently has four pending cases on behalf of EMW. The onslaught of legal challenges dates back to early 2017, “when our general assembly finally had enough members willing to vote for some of these extreme pieces of legislation,” Gatnarek says. The cases challenge new laws that force medically unnecessary narrated ultrasounds; ban dilation and evacuation, the most common form of abortion in the second trimester; and outlaw most abortions after six weeks, a measure Bevin signed into law earlier this year. All of these laws are on hold pending the ongoing litigation.
The ACLU has appealed the ultrasound law to the US Supreme Court, and the other EMW cases are currently or likely to be appealed to the 6th Circuit Court in Ohio (where six of the 16 active judges have been appointed by Trump) and could easily end up before the Supreme Court. Bevin hasn’t been shy about wanting to see Kentucky become the state that sends up the case that strikes down Roe v. Wade now that Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation might provide an anti-abortion majority. “Some of these will go all the way to the…US Supreme Court,” Bevin said during his State of the Commonwealth address earlier this year, “but at the end of the day we will prevail because we stand on the side of right and we stand on the side of life.”
The fourth case the ACLU has challenged poses the most immediate and dire threat for EMW. The state has a law mandating abortion clinics sign ambulance transport agreements, a requirement that EMW easily met for over a decade, only to be told they failed requirements once Bevin’s appointees took office. Beshear, along with 21 other attorneys general, filed briefs arguing against the Bevin administration’s attempts to shut down EWR. “It’s safe to say that it can be quite exhausting,” Gatnarek says of the clinic’s past few years battling the Bevin administration. (EMW referred press requests to the ACLU.) “I know that it is an unfortunate addition to the priorities of the doctors and the staff at the clinic. I know that they’d much rather be focused solely on providing patient care rather than having to put any time or energy or resources towards these lawsuits.”
Those extra legal costs have forced EMW to raise prices, and no one is more aware of the consequences than Marcie Crim, who until recently worked as executive director of Kentucky Health Justice Network, the state’s main abortion fund, which offers funds and assistance for people who can’t afford to pay for their abortions.
Crim started as the group’s executive director two weeks before Trump won the 2016 election, which also swept in a Republican majority in the Kentucky state legislature. It was the first time Democrats had been completely out of power since the 1920s, allowing Bevin and his allies to begin a full-on assault on reproductive rights. “Everything became chaotic and frightening,” she says. “And access was being stripped away on a daily basis. More and more barriers were being erected, and as more barriers were being erected, more people were in need of assistance.” At first, she says, KHJN averaged 10 calls per week from people who needed assistance. But when I met with her at a coffee shop in Lexington in June, she told me the group had received 31 calls the previous week.
Pretty much every request related to abortion comes with an ask to help pay for the procedure itself. “I would say 90 percent of folks, even if they need transportation or lodging or anything else, they need assistance paying for the procedure,” Crim says. Kentucky is one of the most expensive states to get an abortion, and by law predating the Bevin era, no health insurance plan in the state—public or private—can pay for abortions unless the mother’s life is at risk (and unless the person pays for an additional separate policy). Per Crim, it costs $750 to get a pill-induced abortion at EMW, an option only available up through 10 weeks of pregnancy. “And then it shoots up in giant leaps,” she says of the cost.
And that’s only if you get an early-term abortion. Even before Bevin passed the 6-week ban (which is still on hold pending the ACLU lawsuit), the state limited abortions after 22 weeks. Crim says that many people KHJN works with struggled to save up funds, but were not able to pass through the logistical hurdles of getting to Louisville before reaching that limit. So increasingly, her organization has to help arrange travel for people to other states, sometimes sending the as far away as Colorado, New Mexico, and Washington, DC*.
Somewhat paradoxically, the effort to restrict abortion access has prompted more late-term abortions, the thing that Republicans supposedly most decry. “The folks in Frankfort and the Bevin administration, every single time they sign a law and put another barrier in place,” Crim says, “they push people to having to wait to get abortions.”
This spring, abortion rights sprung to the forefront of national politics. Alabama kicked off the wave by outlawing all abortions, and eight other states have passed similar bills. Missouri’s Republican governor tried to revoke the state’s last abortion provider’s license, a move currently embroiled in a legal battle that could, any day now, leave Missouri as the first state without any abortion provider in the era of Roe v. Wade.
Liberals nationwide reacted in horror to the spate of new laws. Hollywood stars called for a boycott of filming in Georgia over the state’s restrictions, and people across the country vowed that the largely male politicians behind these laws would come to regret their decisions when they had to face voters.
Bevin has made fighting abortion one of the central planks of his reelection campaign. After primary night results came in this spring, the governor held a press conference to hammer his opponent for supporting access to abortion. “Andy Beshear is somebody who literally brought NARAL in just in the last couple of days to help push him over the top in this primary; who is strongly and unapologetically pro-abortion. The contrast with [running-mate state Sen. Ralph Alvarado] and myself, who are strongly pro-life, who are supported by President Trump, and are supportive of the values of the people of Kentucky. It will be a binary choice.”
And the uncomfortable reality for Democrats in the state is that playing up social issues could work in Bevin’s favor. A 2014 poll from Pew found that 57 percent of adults in Kentucky think abortion should be illegal in all or most instances, and earlier this year a survey by Public Religion Research Institute found that only 43 percent of the state thought abortion should be legal in most cases. Social “issues continue to have some resonance in certain areas,” says Scott Lasley, a political science professor at Western Kentucky University. “Abortion is the number one. The legislature has been fairly aggressive… Bevin is very strong on those issues.”
And it’s not just Republicans who could be swayed by Bevin. “In Kentucky we have Democrats who are pro-choice and Democrats who are pro-life,” says Ben Self, the state Democratic chair. “We have both in the state. And because of that, obviously the party is the party of both of those folks. So I think, look, we are a big tent party and so it is a tough issue to talk about.” This year’s lieutenant governor candidate reflects that tension. While Beshear ran unabashedly pro-choice in his competitive primary, his running-mate Jacqueline Coleman described herself as a “pro-life compassionate Democrat,” when she ran for state House in 2014, though has since clarified that, while still pro-life personally. she stands by “each individual woman’s constitutional right to make her own reproductive and health care decisions.” Bevin’s campaign will serve as an initial test for whether Southern Republicans will be rewarded or repudiated for that assault on abortion rights.

Listing a few examples, she proposed using executive action to ban drilling and mining offshore and on federal lands and to do away with the practice of fracking.
But would Americans support these dramatic moves?
A new national poll provided exclusively to Mother Jones suggests they would. The left-leaning think tank Data for Progress and YouGov asked more than 1,000 voters whether they supported nine ways the next presidential candidate could address climate change. Here are the results:
Clearly, the two most popular ideas were “Public info on corporate pollution” and “Energy efficiency standards for buildings and appliances.” If a president wanted to accomplish these goals, says Harvard Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program executive director Joe Goffman, he or she wouldn’t necessarily need the approval of Congress—there’s plenty of precedent for executive action. For example: Elizabeth Warren has proposed legislation forcing companies to disclose the environmental harm they cause as well as their risk of being affected by climate change through her Climate Risk Disclosure Act. But Goffman noted that a president could do the same thing through the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose members are appointed by the president, but is otherwise independent.
Those two most popular policies are also the only ideas that attracted support from a majority of respondents who identified as Republican—they were largely against everything else suggested in the survey. I suspect that Republican respondents didn’t come out strongly against those ideas because neither corporate pollution disclosure nor energy efficiency improvement have been high-profile targets of President Donald Trump, who has a polarizing effect on whatever policy he decides to embrace. To wit: Note that some of the biggest partisan splits were on “US rejoin Paris Agreement,” and “reverse Trump vehicle fuel efficiency:”
The upshot of all this: While many Democratic candidates have focused on the bundle of progressive climate legislation known as the Green New Deal, most of the ideas in the poll wouldn’t require Congressional support—and most voters would likely approve if a president used executive power to make these bold changes.
“It’s clear that the public supports greater federal action on climate change,” Leah Stokes, a political scientist at UC Santa Barbara who reviewed the polling.
In May, I surveyed legal experts about what a president could do on climate change if he or she was really going bold, but only using existing law. Under the surprisingly durable elastic statutes of the Clean Air and Water Acts, my experts said, a president could get the United States a lot closer to 100 percent clean electricity, transportation, and efficient, cleaner buildings.
There is one possible exception: banning fracking on public lands. While Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris have all expressed interest in using executive power to accomplish this goal, many experts, including Goffman, just don’t think can be done without Congress. What a president could potentially do, they note, is review how the Department of Interior leases land for fossil fuel development—for instance, President Obama issued a moratorium on coal from public lands.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

It Probably Wasn’t Worth It.,Jacob Rosenberg,MotherJones,Politics,"Update, November 11, 2019: On Saturday, Kshama Sawant declared victory in her Seattle City Council race. She called her election “a repudiation of the billionaire class” in front of a banner that said, “TAX Amazon.”
When Amazon pumped $1.5 million into influencing Seattle’s City Council elections in its final weeks—a rather startling bump on the $25,000 spent four years ago, according to Reuters—it begged the question: Can Amazon buy an election? (And, uh, is Prime delivery worth your complicity?)

The main race to watch was that of Kshama Sawant, a socialist who led an attempt to impose a “head tax” on rich technology companies in the form of a per-employee charge on large corporations making more than $20 million per year. It was passed in 2018, and then quickly repealed by the council, but it got the attention of tech giants in town like Amazon and Microsoft.
At first, it appeared she lost her bid for reelection, and that Amazon had flipped the seat. But this afternoon, as the votes have trickled in, Sawant took the lead—edging over 50 percent. As KUOW reported, several of the candidates supported by Amazon’s money are trailing. (There is another round of votes to be dropped into the results this Friday evening at 8 p.m..)
Even so, the Amazon-bought-the-election narrative doesn’t quite fit. Sawant’s opponent, Egan Orion, told local outlets he wished Amazon had stayed out of it. “In my race, it was completely unnecessary,” he said. “We had record fundraising.”
Not to be too Kai Ryssdal, but let’s just run some numbers on how crazy it got. About 74,000 people are registered to vote in Seattle’s District 3. Orion raised $402,056; Sawant raised $523,056. According to public filings, Orion netted nearly $420,000 in independent expenditures. Notably, the PAC that Amazon was funneling the big bucks to, Civic Alliance for a Sound Economy (CASE)—associated with the Seattle Chamber of Commerce—gave $278,891 to Orion, but they also gave around $20,000 to Sawant too, weirdly. People for Seattle, another business affiliated PAC, added another $40,463 to Orion; Sawant’s independent expenditures totaled $22,044.
That is—if you include both candidates—more than $20 per registered voter.
Once the vote total comes in on Friday night, it could be even higher, if we make the bold assumption that not everyone registered actually cast a ballot.
As I wrote in October, there has also been a tension between the flood of money from independent expenditures and a new public financing model called Democracy Vouchers, which aims to calm (if not actually defeat) the influence of corporate cash by giving each Seattle resident up to $100 for political spending.  Some critics expressed concern that it only further motivated powerful PACs and corporations to invest in local races. Locally, it seemed Sawant’s leftist persona (which leans to Trotskyite) had ignored the ire of the tech companies, inspiring a flood of cash. We noted in earlier reporting that the technology upper crust certainly pitched in:
Whatever the case for the money surge, what seems surprising is that it still fell short. Sawant looks primed to win; one of the candidates CASE gave the most to, Jim Pugel, a former police chief, is behind too. (Pugel got less coverage than Orion’s claim to beat Sawant, but he received a $319,600 boost from CASE and $135,835 from People for Seattle.)
Perhaps Seattle will see a return of the head tax after all.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

As the Trump administration clamped down even further on asylum over the summer and threatened Mexico with tariffs if it didn’t stop more Guatemalans, Hondurans, and Salvadorans from reaching the US border, those camps started to shrink—until recently, when the makeshift shelters began to be occupied by a new group of would-be asylees: Mexicans.
On a recent afternoon near the Paso del Norte bridge, I met a petite 23-year-old woman who’s been at the encampment with her husband and three young sons for the past five weeks. They fled the cartel-stricken state of Michoacán to seek asylum and are now sleeping on a sidewalk under a multicolor tarp.
“I wish I didn’t have to be here—it’s tough living here,” she told me while sitting on the sidewalk, keeping an eye on her youngest son. It was starting to get cold, and her kids had already gotten sick. But she couldn’t return to her hometown, she said. Before she headed north, a relative was murdered, his chopped-up remains delivered to the family in a bag. Shortly thereafter, there were whispers that a group in her town was kidnapping children, and when her sister, a police officer, confirmed the rumors and told her to flee, her family left immediately.
Around her at the encampment, dozens of tents and tarps lined both sides of the small street leading to the international port of entry. According to lawyers with Catholic Legal Immigration Network (CLINIC) and the American Civil Liberties Union, the first asylum-seeking Mexican families began settling along the border in Juárez in early September, after being turned away at the port of entry by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Now, two months later—with violent outbursts on the upswing across Mexico—there are more than 3,000 Mexican asylum seekers spread out in camps and shelters near the three international bridges in Juárez, according to estimates from volunteers, NGOs, and the ACLU. (The increase in asylum seekers coincides with an increase in the number of so-called family units from Mexico apprehended along the border: In the fiscal year that ended on September 30, there were 6,004 Mexican family unit apprehensions, up from about 2,200 in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.)
The thing is, advocates note, US immigration officials are legally obligated to process Mexican asylum seekers at the border. “They’re turning those asylum seekers right back into the country from which they’re fleeing prosecution,” said Shaw Drake, policy counsel with the ACLU Border Rights Center—and that’s in direct violation of US domestic and international laws signed after World War II that ensure that no state turns away refugees fleeing persecution in their home countries. Yet people at the camp say CBP officials send people back across the bridge all the time—a tactic known as metering that limits the number of people asking for asylum on any given day.
The young family from Michoacán found this out the hard way upon arriving in Juárez. On their first night there, they walked up the bridge, ready to petition for asylum at the port of entry. But before they could reach the US side of the bridge, CBP agents turned the family back to Mexico and told them they had to get on a list.
These waitlists started popping up around summer 2018, when Central American migrants trying to present themselves at legal ports of entry were told to wait in Mexico because CBP claimed it couldn’t process them in large groups. As the number of people requesting asylum grew, and as more and more migrant caravans arrived from Central America, the waitlists became the only way to get in front of a CBP official. It could be months until people’s numbers are called.
“This is illegal, this is cruel, and this is unfair,” said Tania Marie Guerrero, an attorney with CLINIC who’s working at the camps daily. “Ultimately, it is a judge’s job to decide who get asylum—it’s not up to CBP or Border Patrol.”
Since September, a second set of waitlists has been formed, this one with the names of thousands of Mexican citizens. The afternoon I visited, the list went up to 207 at Paso del Norte. The woman from Michoacán was number 51. If CBP continued calling out only a few numbers each week, she’d still have months to go. Other international bridges in Juárez have longer lists, and since each number is likely to represent a family of three or five, it’s hard to tell exactly how many Mexican citizens are waiting.
The camps are growing, and more people are expected to seek asylum in the United States as a result of recent public killings and shootouts across Mexico. Videos of Sinaloa Cartel gunmen shooting at police in broad daylight in a residential neighborhood went viral last month, terrifying the whole country. Last week, in a brutal attack in northern Mexico, nine members of a Mormon family were killed by assailants, who incinerated women and children. President Donald Trump tweeted about the incident, calling drug cartels “monsters” and offering help to Mexico’s president to “wipe them off the face of the earth.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R- S.C.) said he would rather go to Syria than some places in Mexico: “There’s some places over there that are completely lawless.”
Of course, that’s exactly the argument that immigration lawyers have been making for months in response to the Trump administration’s Migrant Protection Protocols (a.k.a. “Remain in Mexico”) policy, which has forced more than 50,000 migrants, mostly from Central America, to wait out their court proceedings in Mexico. Not only is Mexico unsafe, they contend, but it’s especially dangerous for these migrants in limbo along the border.
At an October 29 press conference, CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan attributed the rise of Mexican asylum seekers to smugglers who “started taking out social-media ads and telling Mexican nationals that if you grab a kid it’s your passport to the United States.” That line didn’t sit well with advocates like Guerrero, who visits the camps multiple times a week and holds informational sessions for anyone who will listen to make sense of the newest policy changes regarding asylum in the United States. She constantly hears about the fear and violence families are experiencing across Mexico and about the lack of support from law enforcement. “There’s nothing easy about this,” Guerrero said, pointing to the encampment behind her.
During his press conference, Morgan said CBP is working with the White House “and trying to develop new initiatives within the current legal framework that we can apply to the Mexican families as well.” Last week, BuzzFeed News reported on a secretive CBP pilot program in El Paso that significantly reduces the time Mexican families have to prepare their asylum case while in custody—making an already difficult process all but impossible to navigate for the vast majority of asylum seekers, many of whom have no access to legal counsel.
“This places asylum seekers at a complete disadvantage, setting them up for failure,” Guerrero said of the pilot program. In such a short timeframe and without legal representation while in detention, these migrants are “cold, sleepless, hungry, and fearful of people,” yet they are “expected to respond to a series of questions that will determine the rest of their lives.”
I reached out to CBP for an interview about how the agency is handling the asylum requests from Mexicans in Juárez but did not get a response.
On a recent Tuesday afternoon at the border camp, little kids ran around playing with a ball while teens huddled around a cellphone watching videos. The temperature was starting to drop; adults sat on the sidewalks looking bored and defeated. A woman dunked a loofah in a bucket with soapy water, struggling to get her toddler to stand still while she cleaned him up. Most of the Central Americans who lived here earlier in the year are now staying in one of the many shelters that have popped up throughout the city, including a large facility the Mexican government opened in the summer at the request of the United States to help non-Mexican migrants wait out their day in court.
The woman from Michoacán said that if she could’ve stayed in her hometown with her family she would’ve done so. But as I asked more questions about the life she fled back home, she started to avert her eyes and nervously rub her palms together. She explained that families like hers wished they didn’t have to sleep on the streets of Juárez—it’s embarrassing, she said.
“Who would want to live like this? It’s cold, and we go hungry sometimes,” she said. “People walk by sometimes—they call us lazy and dirty.” Her eyes filled with tears. Her oldest son, who’s still just seven, wrapped his arms around her and gently placed his head on her shoulder, trying to comfort her.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But It Didn’t Happen.,Jessica Kutz,MotherJones,Environment,"This piece originally appeared in High Country News and appears here as part of our Climate Desk Partnership.
Exactly a year ago, as the devastating Camp Fire swept through the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. Frank A. Jr. Funes, a disabled 69-year-old Vietnam veteran, woke in the early morning hours to a phone call. It was his pastor, checking to see if he had evacuated. Immediately, Funes looked outside his window: His neighbor’s house was already burning, and the flames were licking at his own fence. He, his wife and their 4-year-old grandson rushed out the door. “I didn’t have time to grab anything,” he said. “The wind was blowing like crazy, and the fire was just right around the house.”
That day, Funes lost the house he had lived in for the last seven years. He has since found a new home 15 miles away. But the winds are a constant reminder of how vulnerable he and his neighbors are to wildfires. Already this year in Northern California, the Kincade Fire has burned nearly 78,000 acres and destroyed 174 homes. Now, whenever the gusts kick up, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), the region’s largest utility provider, preemptively cuts power to decrease the likelihood of a sparked transmission line starting a fire, as happened with last year’s Camp Fire. These shutoffs could last through the rest of November and for the foreseeable future, and Funes, like many others, feels helpless without electricity.
When PG&E shut off power in early October, 2.1 million people lost electricity. Amid the darkness and confusion of the next two days, residents caught a glimpse of what researchers call “the climate gap.” Those with solar panels, and more importantly, solar battery storage, fared pretty well during the outages. Tesla electric-car owners, some of whom had home solar systems, boasted about making pizzas in the midst of the blackout, while others watched movies in their parked cars. Meanwhile, those with limited means ended up buying expensive and polluting gas-powered generators at prices ranging from a couple hundred to a few thousand dollars. Many people, including some who rely on food stamps, were forced to throw out spoiled food. Those with medical disabilities—like Funes, who uses an electric wheelchair—worried about how long the outage would last and how much it would cost to keep the generator running. Just moving the generator in and out of storage was a physical challenge for him and his wife.
The state already has a plan in place to help remedy this disparity. In 2017, California designated funding to help disadvantaged residents and community organizations access new technology like solar batteries, through its Self Generation Incentive Program’s Equity Budget. It sounds like the perfect solution, one that by 2019, had accrued $72 million. The problem is, for residents, not one installation has taken place.
For years, so-called “early adopters”—people who buy things like electric vehicles, or install solar panels on their roofs—have been rewarded with rebates. But people who cannot afford the upfront costs miss out on the savings and new technology. As a result, by the end of 2017, solar panels were three times as likely to be found outside of disadvantaged communities, per capita, than in them, according to “Distributed Solar and Environmental Justice,” a research study conducted by Physicians, Scientists and Engineers for Healthy Energy (PSE). Meanwhile, low-income residents pay significantly more for electricity than early adopters do. That’s partly because a larger portion of their paychecks goes to energy costs, says Boris Lukanov, a senior scientist with PSE and lead author of the study—about 7.2% of a low-income family’s paycheck, compared to the average of 3.5% of their more fortunate neighbors pay. But it’s also because in places like California, where solar adoption is high, the cost of moving electricity around the grid falls on those who use more power. That includes disadvantaged residents, whose housing infrastructure might not be the most energy-efficient, and whose access to solar installations is limited, due to the high cost. Working-class communities often have the most to gain from sustainable energy, and not just for financial reasons: Low-income and communities of color are disproportionately impacted by high gas emissions.
Across the country, well-intentioned local and state governments hope to close that energy gap and assist their most disadvantaged residents through programs like the Equity Budget. But they keep running into problems. Stan Greschner, chief policy officer at GRID Alternatives, a nonprofit that works to make clean energy more accessible, said the reason is pretty simple: Low-income residents simply can’t afford any extra expenses. Even if a program like the Equity Budget covers half of the cost of a solar battery, the price is still too high for the struggling residents it’s trying to benefit. “If we don’t address the upfront cost barrier to adopting the technology, it will not reach low-income families, period,” Greschner said. “That was the biggest failure of the initial program.”
This past September, the California Public Utilities Commission announced sweeping changes to the budget in hopes that more people will be encouraged to apply. The solution, it turns out, is more nuanced than simply having to pay for the upfront cost of solar batteries. Starting in 2020, the program will aim to cover nearly all of the costs for a battery installation for residents who live in a disadvantaged or low-income community.
Disadvantaged communities, as defined by California, face a “combination of economic, health, and environmental burdens.” In addition, residents who meet that threshold and live in high wildfire-risk zones like Los Angeles or the Sierra Nevada will get their energy storage needs met through yet another initiative, the Equity Resiliency Program, which provides an extra $100 million in funding. Crafted in anticipation of events like this fall’s wildfires and blackouts, it’s aimed at providing disadvantaged and medically vulnerable residents like Funes with greater energy resiliency. Tribal nations will also be eligible for this new funding.
Some structural improvements make the program easier to apply for. And because funding can now be coupled with existing solar panel incentives aimed at disadvantaged residents, people can take advantage of both programs at the same time. This is good news for renters, too: Forty-three percent of California’s low-income residents live in multi-family housing, which will now be able to pair existing solar panel subsidies with storage options. The savings in solar energy would be passed down to tenants, and the buildings could serve as “resiliency centers” for the greater community whenever an outage hits.
How the utility rolls out the new program “could very well be the key to success or failure of this program,” said Greschner. Disadvantaged communities have often been targets for financial schemes and are understandably wary of flashy incentives. One recent scam, tried to peddle fake solar installations to large Spanish-speaking immigrant populations. And many residents won’t even know about the program unless the marketing materials are available in a language they can read—something that is so far uncertain in the new marketing plan. In Lukanov’s study, the authors stated linguistic isolation was strongly associated as to whether or not residents had solar panels. “In a lot of communities, the heads of households are non-English-speaking,” Greschner said. “They don’t respond to a utility bill insert (in English) that says, ‘Hey, you qualify.’ ” They need to be reached in different ways and in their language, and so far, programs in the state have fallen short in that respect, Lukanov said.
Nonetheless, for people like Funes, who heard he could add battery storage to his house once the new Equity Budget rolls out, the changes couldn’t come quick enough. He got his solar panels last year, but without storage, they are useless during the blackouts. “I am praying for the batteries to go through,” he said. Lately, he’s been distributing pamphlets to his neighbors, telling them about the solar panels and the possibility of battery storage. But for now, he’s left to the whims of the Santa Ana winds, and of PG&E. “(The power) is going to be going out all the way through November,” Funes said. “I read in the newspaper and on the internet that it is going to be this way for 10 years.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

I saw an old tweet of yours resurface on Saturday to mark the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It’s from 2015, when you were a Fox News commentator and not a flack in the Trump administration, though these days is there any difference?

In so many ways you’re right. Walls do work. The Berlin Wall, for instance, worked for 28 years to sanction oppression, normalize human rights abuses, rob innocent citizens of any autonomy, and reward despots. It divided Germany between the prosperous and democratic west, and the Soviet satellite in the east, where hundreds of thousands of people participated in a security apparatus in which they informed on neighbors, co-workers, family members, even spouses. Did you know that at least 5,000 East Germans tried to escape? And this wall worked so well, 239 people died attempting to cross it, attempting to overcome its barbed wire and soldiers trained to kill.
But here’s the thing. For once, you may have just been a little bit off message with your tweet. It may have slipped your mind back then, in the thrill of being there, that not all walls are created equal. Sure, I get that you totally believe that our wall on the southern border that the president is so determined to build is a good wall. The Great Wall of China is an amazing wall. But somehow, as a loyal Republican with a PhD in international relations from Columbia and a former researcher for Richard Nixon in his emeritus years, you have forgotten that the Berlin Wall was one of those bad walls. One that in 1987, your sainted Ronald Reagan memorably told Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down.”
You may have missed some of the memorials scattered throughout the city for those who were killed during the Holocaust. Berlin is a city that takes history really, really seriously. Maybe the next time you’re there, you should head out to this residential area in the periphery of the heart of Berlin to visit the former Stasi prison, Hohenschönhausen, where men and women were sent after they’d been deemed unreliable members of society because they, say, wrote a letter to a friend in the west, or expressed an opinion that skirted uncomfortably close to criticizing the regime. They were tortured there. Some people lost their minds there. Some people stayed for years without having any idea of why. They were all living in that walled-off part of Berlin. Their crimes and their punishments would not have borne up to much scrutiny in a place where the rule of law prevailed. But in a walled-off country, no problem.
You are clearly too young to remember this program from the early ’60s called That Was the Week That Was. (To be honest, it’s not like I remember it very well either.) It was a satirical look at current events, and in January 1964, when the Berlin Wall had been functioning for three years and authorities permitted a brief period of visitation for Christmas, they ran this strange hand ballet by puppeteer Burr Tillstrom. The creator of one of the earliest kid’s programs on TV, Kukla, Fran and Ollie, about a little group of adorable puppets who had adventures, Tillstrom in this depicted for American audiences a moment when a couple was finally separated by the wall. A parent and child? A brother and sister? It doesn’t really matter. I don’t remember when I first saw it, but it just has stuck with me in all its weirdness and raw emotion.

Why is this so strangely affecting? The universality of hands, I think, helps—so free from gender, age, and any other obvious markers. It depicts with such austerity so many human emotions underlying a narrative of unjust separation and a too-brief reunion between the saved and the damned: shyness, rhapsodic moments, sweet generosity, the sheer agony at the unfairness of it all once visiting hours have ended.
The Berlin Wall didn’t just divide that city. It literalized the image of the Iron Curtain that had descended across Europe after World War II, dividing the continent between the totalitarian communist system and liberal democracy. My family is Hungarian, and I had a quite a few relatives living on the other side of that metaphorical wall. My grandparents lost their home and were deported to the countryside. My grandfather lost his pension. My aunt was first sentenced to death and then life imprisonment for being too friendly with the Americans. My father’s cousin was murdered by the secret police. Walls work, sure, but to say it is only to beg the one question that matters: work for whom?",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

On Friday, while the first-term Democratic congresswoman from New York was introducing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at a rally in Council Bluffs, the state’s Republican bigwigs took their shots at the Lincoln–Reagan Dinner at a Marriott ballroom in downtown Des Moines.
“Doctor Ocasio-Cortez,” state GOP chairman Jeff Kaufmann announced, would be in town the next day with “Crazy Bernie.” “She’s got a problem with our cows here!” he said, referring to the Green New Deal she and Sanders had come to Iowa to talk about.
Joni Ernst, the state’s Republican junior senator, brought up the pair again, and again the audience booed. “We know what kind of reception they’re gonna get!”
Did we? At three stops over two days, Ocasio-Cortez was greeted with only a smattering of protests—I saw four people with weird signs on Saturday making fun of her for being a bartender—and large crowds in Council Bluffs, Des Moines, and Coralville. These were her first appearances with Sanders since she endorsed him in Queens last month. Technically, she was here in the first-in-the-nation caucus state to talk up the Green New Deal, the sweeping economic and environmental overhaul she introduced in Congress to combat climate change, now a major plank in the Sanders platform. But more than that, she was here as a sort of proof of concept—living, breathing evidence that the political revolution Sanders had promised wasn’t just happening but evolving.
The centerpiece of Ocasio-Cortez’s visit was a three-hour long climate summit at Drake University on Saturday. People heard from speakers such as Zina Precht-Rodriguez, an organizer at the Sunrise Movement, and the writer and activist Naomi Klein. Panelists discussed chicken farming and water quality and renewable energy while sitting in front of big watercolor panels painted by the artist Molly Crabapple—workers in orange vests putting up solar panels, workers in orange vests working on wind turbines, workers in orange vests…farming, maybe? I could go on about the content of the thing, but the content wasn’t what was revelatory; what was remarkable was the fact that it was happening at all.
“Four years ago when I was running around Iowa and New Hampshire and going all over this country, I talked about climate change, and people nodded their heads and I said, yeah, it’s a serious problem,” Sanders told the crowd in Des Moines. “I was on a national debate [and] a moderator said, ‘What do you think is the great national security crisis facing this country?’ And I said climate change. People kind of didn’t fully appreciate that answer. But the point is that over the last four years, as I go around the country today, people do understand.”
This is a meaningful shift in the United States, driven in large part by a revitalized activist movement. But it’s also a shift in how Sanders approached the issue. Four years ago, Sanders wasn’t avoiding the issue of climate change. (He was talking up “fossil fuel billionaires,” and pushing a climate agenda of his own.) But he wasn’t running on it quite like this, with three-hour summits where people who aren’t running for any office at all talked about the poultry industry, and corporate consolidation of pig-farming, and electrification of freight rail. He wasn’t doing a full weekend of events on the theme, in a state where corn and beef are king. No, this was something new, because in the time since the last campaign ended and this one began, the kinds of idealistic young lefty activists his campaign had counted on in 2016 had latched onto something else entirely and built it into a new organizing force.
And it was being shepherded, to a large degree, by the woman on stage with him—a former campaign organizer who’d protested at Standing Rock, then went and ran for Congress, and then almost immediately introduced the Green New Deal. She is Sanders’ most powerful surrogate in 2020 precisely because her career is the story the movement wants to believe about itself.
Ocasio-Cortez also just happens to be uncommonly good at this, adept at inverting the arguments that have traditionally been wielded against people with politics like hers. “When it comes to a Green New Deal people say—always, always, always with this question of ‘how are you going to pay for it?’” she said. “As if we’re not paying for it now.” She rattled off a list of recent, headline-grabbing shocks—the California wildfires, Hurricane Maria, decreasing crop yields.
“Coal miners are being denied their pensions while coal barons are being bailed out by the federal government,” she said. The message of Bernie 2020 is that you’re already paying for it.
Later that day, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders spoke to a crowd of a few thousand at a field house in Coralville, near the University of Iowa campus. Sanders gear was in abundance, but he wasn’t the main draw for everyone. Caleigh Stanier, a high school junior, told me she came for Ocasio-Cortez, not Sanders.
“I admire her charisma,” she said. She’d watched the congresswoman’s Netflix documentary, Break Down the House, and seen some of her stuff on YouTube. She was drawn to a young female politician with the “boldness” to push a program like the Green New Deal.
Ditto for Jordan Mehling. Though she’ll be supporting Sanders for the second time next year, Ocasio-Cortez was the impetus to make the trip down from Minnesota. Watching the young Democratic Socialist challenge Washington political types had been an inspiration. “Before AOC came into my view, I cared about these things and I liked Bernie because he was standing up for these things that I also believed in, but”—but—”She’s the one who sort of made me feel if she can do it why can’t I do something as well?” Here was someone her doing the maximum. “I can at least be doing the minimum.”
Jessica Hillman, who had driven out from Chicago to see Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, saw the congresswoman as something like a generational bat signal.
“We all wanted to do something meaningful, we all wanted change, but we didn’t feel like we had any power,” she said. “We couldn’t connect with other people and then when she came out it was almost like a message that was sent out that connected us all together.”
I saw a little girl jumping up and down as Ocasio-Cortez began to talk, and two young women rush into the crowd to get closer. Afterward, supporters flocked to the far side of the hall for handshakes and selfies. I came upon a University of Iowa student named Harry Manaligod excitedly telling a group of friends about shaking the congresswoman’s hand.
“I came for Ocasio-Cortez,” Manaligod told me. “She’s like a completely different league. I feel like there’s so many politicians that have made sacrifices to achieve their goals, and I feel like she’s not the kind of person that’s gonna let one thing fall to the wayside to get her goals accomplished.”
Further down the line, a grown man walked away grinning. “I can’t wash my hand now!” he shouted.
Sanders’ core identity is that he’s a man who doesn’t change—Ocasio-Cortez told the crowd Saturday night that she endorsed him because he had been fighting for people like her before she was born. The consistency is the thing; you hear it again and again. So much so that there is a frustration among supporters that other candidates have profited at his expense by simply appropriating aspects of his agenda.
“Every candidate is saying what Bernie has been saying,” said Robin Ruetenik of Coralville. “It’s a coattail orgy.”
But if this campaign turns out different from the last, it’ll be because of the subtle ways he and his movement have evolved. In 2016, Sanders was traveling around the country, promising a new day in America that you could only faintly begin to discern. In 2020, the revolution he promised isn’t quite so hard to imagine—she takes the stage right before him. That’s its own form of renewable energy.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z
https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/appealing-to-black-voters-in-south-carolina-elizabeth-warren-fires-up-white-liberals/,2019-11-11,,,politics,"November 11, 2019","Appealing to Black Voters in South Carolina, Elizabeth Warren Fires Up White Liberals",Kara Voght,MotherJones,Politics,"Elizabeth Warren came to the South Carolina Lowcountry on Saturday and played all the standards. At a town hall in Goose Creek, about 20 miles north of Charleston, she talked about corporate greed and government decisions that put the wealthy few ahead of the working many, before rounding into her proposals for voting reforms that would strengthen democracy. This was an important part of her message in South Carolina, the crescendo where she could address herself directly to the procedural impediments facing the state’s many Black voters. The crowd was with her, too, cheering wildly when she promised to end the gerrymandering practices that have historically disempowered racial minorities and to “end racist voter suppression.”
The curious part was that, by my count, the audience of 750 or so people was at least 80 percent white. Several attendees I’d spoken with had driven up from Charleston, an ever-gentrifying, ever-whitening coastal city full of transplants who’ve fled colder climates for the Sun Belt. For this predominantly white crowd, some of the day’s biggest applause lines were about ending structural racism against Black people.
In its swing through South Carolina, host of the fourth nominating contest in the Democratic presidential primary, Warren’s campaign has gotten a glimpse of the central dynamic in the so-called “Great Awokening,” the name given to our current era of expanding racial consciousness among white liberals. Pitching herself to Black voters who are essential to winning the state’s primary, Warren finds herself firing up white liberals.
I asked Warren after the Goose Creek town hall why she thought a majority-white audience responded so enthusiastically to the explicitly antiracist parts of her message. “I think people understand that our democracy is broken,” she told me, reiterating her points about why rich people don’t deserve a bigger share of it. She added, “One of the most fun parts about being out and doing this town halls”—Goose Creek is her 160th of the cycle—”is how engaged people are over rebuilding our democracy.”
It’s hard to say whether the Warren campaign might have expected a different mix of folks to show up to see her on Saturday. Goose Creek High School serves a majority-minority student body that’s 40 percent Black, 30 percent white, and 15 percent Latino; the town and surrounding areas hew closer to 70 percent white, though nearby North Charleston—about halfway between Goose Creek and downtown Charleston—is nearly 50 percent Black.
But the town hall was the last stop on Warren’s three-day swing through the Carolinas focused on wooing nonwhite voters and highlighting her racial equality message. It included an appearance at an environmental justice forum aimed at highlighting how communities of color disproportionately suffer the effects of environmental inaction, as well as an education forum in Summerton, South Carolina, a majority-Black town in the state’s “Corridor of Shame,” so called for its history of educational inequality, poor school funding, and low educational achievement. On Thursday, Warren appeared in Raleigh, North Carolina, alongside Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), who had endorsed Warren’s candidacy earlier that day.
Warren’s mission set her up for some obvious questions. At the environmental justice forum, moderator Amy Goodman pressed Warren on whether Iowa and New Hampshire—“two of the whitest states”—should be the first states to host presidential primaries. Warren huffed a little and dodged the question, noting she’s “just a player in the game on this one.”

Following her Goose Creek town hall, a reporter pointed out the majority-white audience and asked what the campaign’s strategy is to diversify its crowds. Warren replied with her own question, asking the reporter if she’d seen the majority-Black audience who gathered in a high school library to see her speak with educators in Summerton.
“It’s keep showing up and keep reaching out,” Warren said of her approach. “I want to introduce myself to every single voter in South Carolina. And that’s true, regardless of what their race is, what their gender is, what their party affiliation is—2020 is our chance, our chance to turn around a country that’s working great for those at the top and not so much for” everyone else.
At its core, Warren’s campaign poses the question of whom government works for—the answer, of course, being the wealthy and well-connected. But there’s a line she almost always chases that point with. “Why are working families finding the path so much harder than generations ago?” she’ll say, as she said in Summerton that morning and again that afternoon in Goose Creek. “And why, for people of color, is it even rockier, even steeper?”
Warren is acknowledging the entwinement of racial and class inequalities in a way that seemed to energize the white supporters I spoke with at her events in South Carolina. Christine Jasonis, a white retiree and South Carolina transplant originally from Connecticut, says Warren’s education and Medicare for All plans appeal to her, but she feels “very strongly” about Warren’s antiracism. “If I was a mother of a young Black man today, I would be terrified,” she says. “We fought too hard for this.”
Alec Neller, a white twentysomething who recently graduated from college, told me systemic racism was his top voting issue—and a reason he’s drawn to Warren. “Everyone should have the opportunity to succeed and do what they dream. It makes for a stronger United States and a stronger world,” he said. “I think Trump put [racial inequality] on the table by attacking certain minority groups and calling certain countries ‘shitholes.’”
Trump’s oafishness, while emboldening racists across America, has also had the effect of making racism more obvious to the sort of white liberals who might not have been paying close attention. “You have people saying, ‘Oh, I thought racism was supposed to be over, but clearly, it’s not,’” said Jillian Clayton, a white woman who’s backing Warren.
Clayton, who attended the College of Charleston in the mid-2000s and has lived in the area since, sees something similar at work in her own city. White residents witnessing Charleston’s transformation have become highly attuned to gentrification’s effects, she said, even if they’re also reaping some of its benefits. “We see it happening every day,” she said. “People are getting pushed farther and farther away from the city.”
Back in March, Vox’s Matt Yglesias wrote about the Great Awokening through the lens of researchers and pollsters who have observed a sharp increase in concern among white Democrats about racial inequality and discrimination over the past five years. Yglesias pointed to polling from the Pew Research Center that, back in 2014, found that most Americans didn’t think there was any work left to do to address Black-white inequality. Now, more than 80 percent of self-identifying Democrats say the country needs to make changes to give Black Americans the same rights as whites. Until recently, according to the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress, most white Democrats ascribed racial inequality to a lack of individual initiative. Today, as Yglesias writes, white liberals are now “less likely than African Americans to say that black people should be able to get ahead without any special help.”
The Great Awokening was Yglesias’ coinage, a reference to the religious revival among white Northerners in the years before the Civil War that lent a moral fervor to abolitionist movements. And he predicted similar results for this current moment. “The fundamental reality is that the Awokening has inspired a large minority of white Americans to begin regarding systemic racial discrimination as a fundamental problem in American life—opening up the prospects of sweeping policy change when the newly invigorated anti-racist coalition does come to power,” Yglesias wrote.
Warren has been steadily rising in the polls of South Carolina, where more than 50 percent of the primary electorate is Black. The Post and Courier’s first poll back in May put Warren at a dismal 8 percent behind Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Joe Biden, who received 46 percent of support. The latest Post and Courier survey, conducted in mid-October, found Warren in second place at 19 percent, only 11 points behind Biden. Though pollster Pat Reilly did not directly explain Warren’s rise, he told the Post and Courier that Biden’s drop came “principally from African-American women who are moving to other candidates,” though “none of the top candidates are seeing a decisive jump as a result.”
The rate of conversion suggests that Black women might be moving toward Warren. At the event in Summerton I watched the candidate use her own story to establish a connection. The education forum had been an intimate gathering of a few dozen attendees—among them local elected officials, business owners, and faith leaders, all of whom told me it was too early for them to throw their support behind any of the Democratic candidates. As Warren recounted her familiar anecdote about how, as a preschool teacher in the 1970s, her contract wasn’t renewed when she became visibly pregnant, a number of Black women in the audience nodded knowingly. A few told me afterward that their friends had had similar experiences during that era.
But there was still work to be done, as the demographics of the Goose Creek event suggest. Just before Warren began speaking there, I met Amelia Duvall, who was standing by herself near the back of the gymnasium. Duvall, a Black woman and business owner from nearby Ladson, had attended the town hall alone. She’s supporting Warren, but when I asked her what she thought of attendance, she shook her head. “She’s gotta get more people in here who look like me,” she said.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But the president’s eldest son’s missteps were not lost on the audience at UCLA on Sunday, where his own supporters, frustrated with the lack of a Q&A opportunity, filled the event with incessant booing. At one point, Trump Jr.’s girlfriend, the former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle, scolded the audience before making fun of their sex lives, an apparent dig at incels. “I bet you engage and go on online dating because you’re impressing no one here to get a date in person.”
The couple abruptly left the event after 20 minutes of booing. But the chaos they left behind did more than expose Trump Jr.’s hypocrisy; it laid bare the increasing tensions on the right, particularly between white supremacists and the conservatives eager to distance themselves from them. The Guardian reports that much of the anger in the room on Sunday came from supporters of Nick Fuentes, a 21-year-old white nationalist quickly gaining prominence with the alt-right crowd, who specifically targeted Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative youth group Turning Point USA. From the Guardian:
A similar crisis erupted at a conservative Q&A last month. “White nationalism and anti-gay hatred have no place in our movement,” Benny Johnson of Turning Point tweeted after the event was similarly drowned out by white nationalists. “This is what the Left wants. It’s time to Wake Up.”
But Johnson and similarly defensive conservatives have little to say about their own roles in encouraging hatred, white nationalism, and anti-Semitism for a new generation. The chaos on Sunday is the kind of thing you should expect when young conservatives are trained to be at the front lines of the culture wars, armed with “fake news” chants and hashtag-ready taunts. As my colleague Stephanie Mencimer reported from Turning Point’s student action summit last year:
As conservatives continue to try to distance themselves from the right’s ugliest faction, don’t expect the Trump Jr.’s of the world to acknowledge their own direct role in creating it.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Here’s Why That’s Terrifying.,Jeremy Schulman,MotherJones,Impeachapalooza,"This morning, Donald Trump took to Twitter to demand that the whistleblower in the Ukraine scandal—along with the whistleblower’s attorney and House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.)—be “investigared [sic] for fraud!” There is, of course, no known evidence that any of those individuals has committed fraud. Rather, the misspelled tweet is a horrifying escalation of the president’s campaign to intimidate and retaliate against the whistleblower.

It’s tempting to dismiss Trump’s Twitter bluster as yet another empty threat with few consequences. It’s also wrong. Time and again, the president has shown a willingness to push the Justice Department and the FBI—and even foreign governments—to investigate and prosecute those he sees as political enemies.
This is, after all, what the Ukraine scandal is all about. Trump and his cronies repeatedly demanded, in public and in private, that Ukraine investigate Democrats. And it nearly worked. According to the New York Times, the Ukrainian president was just days away from announcing the probes Trump wanted when the White House conspiracy began to unravel. In October, the president publicly asked China to investigate the Bidens; later, a top US trade official refused to answer questions from CNN about whether the administration raised the issue during subsequent negotiations with that country.
There’s ample evidence that Trump sees the DOJ as his personal law firm and the attorney general as his private attorney. Don McGahn, Trump’s first White House counsel, testified that in 2017, Trump said words to the effect of, “You’re telling me that Bobby and Jack didn’t talk about investigations? Or Obama didn’t tell Eric Holder who to investigate?” (Bobby Kennedy was JFK’s attorney general; Holder was Obama’s.) Indeed, one of the most chilling parts of the rough transcript of Trump’s call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is Trump’s request that Zelensky discuss the Biden allegations not just with Rudy Giuliani, but also with Attorney General Bill Barr—an indication, perhaps, that Trump hoped to use the US justice system to prosecute the Democratic frontrunner.
In addition, Trump has spent much of the past several years publicly calling for the prosecution of Hillary Clinton. According to the Mueller Report, Trump in 2017 conveyed those desires directly to his then-attorney general, Jeff Sessions, mentioning Clinton’s emails as one of the topics he thought the DOJ should be investigating:
Mueller notes that Sessions didn’t promise Trump that the DOJ “would comply with that request.” But a month after this meeting, Sessions directed John Huber, the US attorney in Utah, to review the department’s handling of various allegations about Clinton and determine whether an investigation should be opened, and whether a special counsel should be appointed. Huber’s probe reportedly includes the same Clinton email controversy that Trump had wanted investigated. Several weeks later, Trump again spoke with Sessions and, according to notes taken by an aid, said in an apparent reference to Clinton, “[Lawyer Alan] Dershowitz says POTUS can get involved. Can order AG to investigate. I don’t want to get involved. I’m not going to get involved. I’m not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.” All of which sounds a bit like Trump’s insistence to Gordon Sondland that there was “no quid pro quo” regarding Ukraine.
Naturally, it does not stop there. Trump has also demanded that law enforcement officials involved in the Russia probe be investigated, even threatening former FBI Director James Comey with jail time. That probe, too, is moving forward; it recently grew into a criminal investigation, though it’s unclear who federal prosecutors targeting. According to the Times, it is being “closely overseen” by Barr.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Anecdotally, it seems like the answer is yes. The Big 8 accounting firms are now the Big 4. There are only four cell phone companies, soon to be three. Four airlines control 80 percent of the American market. The car industry consolidated into the Big Three decades ago. Four companies control two-thirds of the cloud computing market.
But in spite of this anecdotal feeling, it’s an undecided question among economists about whether American businesses are really a lot more concentrated than they used to be. Anyone can pick a few examples of industries that have consolidated, but what happens when you look rigorously at the business community overall?
We’re not going to solve this question today, though in general I’ve been more persuaded by the researchers who say that consolidation has, in fact, happened, and the result has been increasingly monopolistic behavior among US corporations.
One of those researchers is French transplant Thomas Philippon, who is introduced to us today in the New York Times by David Leonhardt. Philippon’s research has convinced him that we have indeed gone through an era of considerable consolidation, and it’s mainly due to weak enforcement of antitrust laws. In Europe, which has much stronger antitrust enforcement than we do, Philippon reports that the top firms have increased their market share far less than American firms. As a result, prices charged to consumers have also increased far less than in America. Here is Philippon’s conclusion about how this has affected American workers:
I find that $5,000 number quite easy to believe. In fact, it seems a little low to me. But how did it happen? Even with weak antitrust enforcement (thanks Robert Bork!), how do companies get away with raising prices and cutting pay? They still have some competition, after all. The answer to that, I think, is the long Republican war against unions:
The destruction of the American working class is a two-part story. First, it was necessary to get rid of unions. As long as they were around, they’d demand a fair share of profits for workers no matter what the competition landscape looked like. That war lasted from about 1947 to 1981. When Ronald Reagan broke the air-traffic controllers union it was the final straw. Unions had already been decimated both by Republican laws and by Republican-led-efforts to train companies in how to resist unionization. Democrats never had the will to fight back hard enough, and after Reagan they never had the power. Republicans won their war against unions decisively.
It was only then, with unions effectively out of the way, that corporations could start consolidating and taking an ever bigger share of profits for top executives and shareholders, leaving workers with stagnating wages and grinding working conditions. No union, for example, would accept the practice of “clopening,” where an employee is required to close up a store at night and then turn right around and open in the morning. Nor would they accept the ever-more-common practice of expecting workers to be on call at all times, never knowing for sure what their work schedule will be. As much as low pay, these are the kinds of things that make work such a burden for the working class these days.
So this is the story. Spend three or four decades wiping out the power of labor unions, and then you can spend the next three or four decades turning the United States into a plutocracy with no one to effectively fight you about it.
And you have to give Republicans credit: Not only did they cobble together this plan and execute it brilliantly, they’ve managed even so to convince much of the working class that only Republicans truly understand their economic woes. They’re the very party that created those woes by killing off unions and then letting corporate America loose to do whatever it wanted, but hardly anyone sees it that way. Donald Trump yells “China” or “Mexico” and the working class howls its approval. I guess it must be China and Mexico that caused all these problems after all.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","Update: Chesa Boudin declared victory on Saturday following a concession from Suzy Loftus, San Francisco’s interim district attorney.
“Look, I didn’t live through that time period,” Chesa Boudin says with a sigh. “I can’t imagine wanting to use violence as a tool for social change. I can’t imagine even thinking that would be an effective way for me to achieve political goals.”
Boudin, San Francisco’s deputy public defender and the Bernie Sanders–endorsed progressive candidate in the city’s DA election on Tuesday, can be forgiven for being a little annoyed. It’s an early July afternoon during a hectic campaign week, and the race is heating up in strange ways. The previous day, the San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs’ Association broadcast on Facebook just how little it thought of his candidacy by declaring him a “radical releaser.” The group also posted a video from the fringe, far-right John Birch Society that attacked him over his family’s background—Boudin being, in their words, the “son of terrorists” and “a communist radical of sorts” who may be funded by billionaire George Soros. “Share if you care,” wrote the DSA.
It was all so very 1969 of the sheriffs, summoning the Birchers to inveigh against the Weathermen. You half expected Wavy Gravy to show up in an attack ad. Boudin’s parents, Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, were members of the militant left-wing Weather Underground, which began as a faction of Students for a Democratic Society and gained infamy in the late ’60s and the ’70s for a spate of political bombings—including at the Pentagon and the State Department headquarters—in protest of the Vietnam War. The group was four years dead when Boudin’s parents handed their 14-month-old to a babysitter and left to participate in one of America’s most notorious crimes, the 1981 Brinks heist, for which they acted as getaway drivers—Gilbert driving and Boudin sitting shotgun in a U-Haul truck that served as a switch vehicle. The perpetrators, led by members of the Black Liberation Army, got away with $1.6 million before a shootout ensued; three people were killed—two cops and a security guard.
Boudin’s parents were sentenced to long prison sentences for their roles in the crime. His father is still incarcerated; his mother was released in 2003 and is now the co-director of the Center for Justice at Columbia University, which works on mass incarceration issues. In their absence, Boudin was raised in Chicago by their close friends and fellow Weathermen Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, now a pair of retired academics who still haunt the fever dreams of right-wingers.
Today, Boudin, 39 years old, is vying to reform from within the sort of office his forebears quite literally tried to blow up. And as has happened throughout much of his adult life, he has had to parry attempts to conflate his parents’ actions with his own political leanings; 1969, it seems, is always being subpoenaed by his critics as evidence against him. A Slate article from 2002 all but lays his parents’ errors at his feet. The New York Times, in a blistering review of his 2009 book about his travels through Latin America, called him “the product of militant politics,” which was a good sight nicer than its assessment of his prose (“Please make it stop,” Dwight Garner wrote).
“I grew up knowing that my parents had used violence as a tool for social change, and that…it didn’t work by any metric, it hadn’t accomplished the political goals that they had, it had imposed a very heavy cost on the victims of the crimes and on me, and on them, our family,” Boudin says. “For me, it was an early and easy decision to reject violence as a tool for social change.”
His disavowal of his parents’ actions is well practiced, a politician’s answer, and he’s careful to untangle their methods from their goals: ending racism, inequality, the war in Vietnam, and the United States’ role in oppression at home and abroad. “I’m confident, I like to think, that had I lived through the ’60s and ’70s, I would have been organizing against the war in Vietnam as they were,” Boudin says. “I like to think that if I’d lived through the ’50s and ’60s I would have been doing whatever I could to be in solidarity with the civil rights movement. From that perspective, I think there’s a shared system of values, broadly defined. But when it comes to the tactics they used, it’s really hard for me to imagine.”
In the narrow context of the DA’s race, Boudin is the closest thing to a radical, if for no other reason than that his rivals—Suzy Loftus, Nancy Tung, and Leif Dautch—are all career prosecutors. David Alan Sklansky, author of the 2017 Progressive Prosecutor’s Handbook, places Boudin in the recent wave of progressive reformers who’ve run “on a platform that’s aimed at rebalancing the criminal justice system, insuring more scrutiny of police, taking new steps to avoid unjust and improper convictions, dialing back mass incarceration, and limiting the racial injustices and imbalances of the system.” He continues: “That’s a kind of DA that almost never won an election say 10, 15 years ago, and now is increasingly common. Boudin is in that mold if he wins.”
But outside the reactionary framework of prosecutorial politics, Boudin is no radical. The invocations of his family history have had the ironic effect of burnishing his institutionalist credentials. It was his mother, after all, who co-wrote something called The Bust Book, a handbook of legal advice for young leftists who get arrested, summarized by one Redbaiting congressman as “use the law to destroy the system.” Elsewhere, Kathy Boudin urged fellow radicals not to engage with the law on its terms. She wrote: “We need to attack the legal system of the United States—courts, grand juries, legislative committees, the ideology itself….” (This got the attention of the FBI.) Chesa Boudin, meanwhile, believes that with the right person installed in the DA’s office, “we can have a system that makes us proud.”
At a moment when Boudin is keeping the ’60s at arm’s length, the reform movement he wishes to join could use some of that old radical spirit. Sklansky notes that the new cohort of progressive prosecutors—including Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, the movement’s lodestar—has done little to devolve the power of the office, the key to bringing about real, lasting change. “All the progressive prosecutors I’m familiar with are using their powers to move the criminal justice system in the direction of more fairness, less harshness, more accountability for police, and less criminalization of poverty,” Sklansky says. “But I don’t think any of them have tried to reduce the powers of the prosecutor’s office. I think they’ve all made the calculation that using the power of the office to make these changes is the most effective way to affect the system.”
Boudin went to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and later attended Yale Law School. He spent a summer clerking on the South African Constitutional Court and learned about South Africa’s halting transition to “an imperfect, to be sure, but a racially inclusive, democratic society, and with it one of the most progressive constitutions in the world.” People like Albie Sachs, an activist who opposed apartheid and got his arm blown off by a bomb for his troubles, and Edwin Cameron, an anti-apartheid lawyer, became his models for social change—two white reformers who didn’t do war with the system but massaged it into something more equitable.
Boudin’s earliest memories, he likes to say in stump speeches, are of waiting in long lines full of Black and Brown women and children and going through prison gates to visit his parents. In his telling, his youth was shaped by these confrontations with the mass incarceration machine. He has witnessed how the criminal justice system tears apart communities and families, and exacts a brutal, asymmetric toll on communities of color.
All of which is why he has never prosecuted a case, and why, since 2012, he has actively worked against the prosecutor’s office as a public defender representing poor clients in criminal cases. It’s also why he’s chosen to run as the city’s top prosecutor. “If we are going to end mass incarceration—and we are, we are,” he said at a campaign event last June, “it starts with changing the people and the ideas that we put in the office of district attorney.”
While the right might call Boudin a socialist or a communist or a radical, his politics fall comfortably in line with the progressive wing of the Democratic party, and he’s racked up endorsements from grassroots progressive groups, Democratic city supervisors including Aaron Peskin and Hillary Ronen, and civil rights icons and activists like Angela Davis and Shaun King. His message is this: end cash bail; close juvenile hall and County Jail No. 4, the top floor of the seismically unsound Hall of Justice, where about 75 percent of those incarcerated suffer from mental health issues or substance abuse; stop the criminalization of homelessness and mental illness; prosecute “bad cops”; and rather than clog the court system with smaller, victimless crimes, focus resources and scheduling on prosecuting the most egregious ones. It’s a radical message only by the standards of the office. The conversation about criminal justice has shifted to such an extent that several of his opponents have laid claim to difference pieces of his platform.
“All of the four candidates in the district attorney race are, in one way or another, arguing for reducing incarceration,” The New York Times reported last May, seeing “little daylight” between Boudin and his main opponent, Suzy Loftus, but that’s not quite right. (The Bust Book writes that The New York Times, “although not useful for any other purposes,” makes for a useful weapon when “rolled up lengthwise and folded in half.”) Loftus is known as the establishment candidate, endorsed by the city’s major Democratic figures and organizations, including Mayor London Breed, Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, and the San Francisco Democratic Party. When George Gascón resigned as DA in October to explore a run for the same job in Los Angeles, it was Loftus, the assistant chief legal counsel in the sheriff’s department, whom Breed handpicked for the interim role—a brazen bit of political chicanery that has surely boosted Loftus’ electoral prospects. Loftus previously worked as a prosecutor in the city’s district attorney’s office before moving under Harris at the state Department of Justice. She then served as president of the San Francisco Police Commission during a scandal-ridden period of deadly police shootings. Of 15 fatal shootings during that era, 10 involved people of color. But she also ushered in a more reform-minded program, and as she often notes, she “oversaw the termination of more officers accused of serious misconduct than ever before.” According to police commission disciplinary reports, none was terminated for use of force incidents. And as Mission Local first reported last week, during Loftus’ tenure on the police commission, the SFPD coordinated with the FBI to gather information on civilians not suspected of criminal activity, directly violating local laws and infringing on First Amendment rights.
In a race in which nearly every candidate is claiming some flavor of reformer bona fides, Boudin’s background is unique in the field for having put those values into action. “Chesa’s lived the crusade for criminal justice reform since he was a child,” says Jim Stearns, a San Francisco political consultant working with Boudin’s campaign. “He’s the only candidate who chose not to be a prosecutor, and not to join this broken system.…He’s never charged money bail, he’s never cooperated with ICE.” (After Boudin stated at a debate in August that he would prosecute ICE agents, Tung, the law-enforcement candidate in the field, joked, “Chesa, if you were running for public defender, I would vote for you.”)
These distinctions are significant. In recent years, voters in cities across the nation—from St. Louis and Chicago to Brooklyn and Houston and well beyond—have sent tough-on-crime prosecutors packing in favor of unapologetic progressives who seek to end mass incarceration, money bail, and police brutality.
The best-known of the bunch is Krasner, a long-time civil rights attorney who’d made a career out of suing the police. Since becoming DA in Philadelphia, he has fired hard-line prosecutors and squared off against the city’s law-and-order culture. He endorsed Boudin early on. “A careful look at his career shows that he’s real about progressive reform, as opposed to being someone who knows what is fashionable to say in an election cycle,” says Krasner. “It’s incredibly important to look at the decisions that people have made, the sacrifices they have made, how effective they have been in pursuing actual progressive reform, before accepting the notion that a campaign is truly progressive.” And that’s vital, he says, because “as we’re seeing progressive candidates win around the country and saying the politically unsayable seems to be a successful strategy, well now everyone is saying it.”
“If you want someone who is going to do things differently, if you recognize, as all the candidates in the race do, that the system is broken, that we need fundamental changes, why would you expect to get those fundamental changes from people who have been part of the system their whole career?” Boudin asks rhetorically. “Why would you look to or trust people so deeply embedded in the status quo to have the imagination, the empathy, the ideas necessary to bring about that change?”
At an event he’d organized for Boudin, Shaun King, the co-founder of Real Justice PAC, who works to elect progressive prosecutors nationwide, spoke to a crowd of a few hundred about his belief in the need for a progressive prosecutor in a major city like San Francisco. “There is a part of me, I don’t mean it as a slight, that’s disappointed that San Francisco is not already there. What everybody in the room knows—and I’m not teaching you anything you don’t already know—is there is the hype of San Francisco and there is the reality of San Francisco. Most of the world thinks of this as the most liberal progressive city in America. What we’re saying is: We want the reality of San Francisco to match its hype.”
In San Francisco, more than 40 percent of all people arrested by police are Black, Boudin often notes, and the overwhelming majority—as many as 85 percent—of people booked into jail suffer from mental illness, substance abuse, or both. In recent years, local law enforcement has been embroiled in scandal for everything from officers shooting unarmed Black men to sending each other racist text messages.
David Latterman, a San Francisco-based political consultant who typically works with center-left candidates, says that Boudin is “not trying to mask who he is.” “A lot of hard-left candidates in San Francisco try to fake their way into being more centrist—seeming more reasonable. He’s not.…And so the question is, ‘Is that what the city wants?’” Noting the abundance of car break-ins and the perception that crime and homelessness and drugs are hurting the city’s reputation right now, Latterman says, “I don’t think the city’s in the mood for real leniency right now. They want the DA to actually be a DA, not a public defender, not a big ideologue.” While King calls San Francisco’s progressivism “hype,” Latterman calls it a “myth.”
Beyond that, there’s the entrenched political machinery that Boudin will have to contend with. Prior to the start of the campaign season, the only candidate with any name recognition was Loftus. And she runs in the right circles. “The thing about San Francisco that’s interesting is, this is a dues-paying city, especially in the political world,” Latterman says. “You show up out of nowhere and win? It doesn’t happen here.…Loftus, she’s a well-known figure and has been running for this office for a while, and has sort of always been seen as next up.”
But Boudin still has reason to be confident. In the last fundraising period, he outraised Loftus by more than $30,000, and has the highest number of individual donors in San Francisco—more than twice as many as Loftus. He has managed to tap into an active grassroots base of progressives in the city who view criminal justice reform as the only way forward. This, according to Larry Krasner, is how these kinds of campaigns are won. The progressive prosecutor movement “is really a grassroots movement, and I view progressive prosecutors as basically being technicians,” says Krasner. “The entire movement is the result of decades of those retributive policies and the cumulative effect of mass incarceration, after you’ve had a buildup and a buildup and a buildup.…The lived experience was the most persuasive thing you could ever have to make people hate those policies and hate mass incarceration.”
San Francisco’s University Club is a members-only social club resting at the peak of Nob Hill, the sort of place that drops $5 million on squash courts and hangs the heads of two African antelope on the wall of the main stairwell. “Get ready for a pretty conservative crowd,” Boudin texts me before a mid-September debate at the University Club. The dining room where the debate is held is all dark wood and big chandeliers, with panoramic views of the San Francisco skyline. This is not a natural setting for a progressive crusader to make his pitch. And while there is some dutiful talk of mass incarceration, the conversation returns over and over again to other, more personally pressing concerns. The swells here are worried about car break-ins and “the homeless problem,” not police accountability, restorative justice, and ending money bail, which, as Boudin tells this crowd of rich and powerful, “privileges the rich and the powerful.”
Rooms like this are where the ideals of progressive prosecution go to die. The Harvard Law Review and others refer to progressive prosecution as a “reformist reform”—a temporary technocratic fix to a fundamentally broken system—and the scene at the University Club goes some way toward explaining their pessimism. Boudin is asking to be put in charge of an institution built to serve the prerogatives of the people in here, the ones milling around the cheese table in their evening finery, talking about the unhoused as if they were a criminal class.
“The paradox of ‘progressive prosecution’ is that the criminal legal system is an oppressive institution,” the Harvard Law Review writes. “Attempting to make the ‘most powerful’ actor in such an institution more progressive seems to miss the point.” The solution, the authors argue, is not to give more power and resources to progressive DAs; it’s to make the office less powerful, for instance with legislation that permanently removes crimes from charging and sentencing menus. Use the law to destroy the system—Kathy Boudin’s Bust Book told us as much. Not all of 1969 needs to be kept at arm’s length.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But according to bombshell testimony in federal court Friday, the Trump team did believe that it was collaborating with WikiLeaks, the organization that publicly disseminated Democratic emails that had been stolen by Russian government hackers.
The revelations came during the trial of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone, who is accused of lying to Congress about his contacts with the Trump campaign. Stone was originally a member of that campaign; he departed in 2015 but remained an informal adviser to Trump. Steve Bannon, who became CEO of the campaign in mid-August 2016, testified Friday that campaign officials saw Stone as their “access point” to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange.
Bannon testified that in the spring and summer of 2016, before he took over the Trump campaign, Stone had “implied” in conversations with Bannon that he was in contact with Assange. “The campaign had no official access to WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, but Roger would be considered if we needed an access point, because he had implied or told me he had a relationship with WikiLeaks and Julian Assange,” Bannon said.
“It was generally believed that the access point to WikiLeaks or Julian Assange would be Roger Stone,” Bannon said in prior grand jury testimony read in court on Friday. Bannon appeared under subpoena and said he would not have agreed to testify otherwise.
On October 3, 2016, when Assange held a strange press conference that failed to live up to expectations of dramatic revelations about Hillary Clinton, Bannon emailed Stone to ask: “What was that?”
Four days later, when WikiLeaks began publishing emails hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, Bannon, according to his testimony, “heard that Roger Stone was somehow involved in the release of those emails.” Bannon said he didn’t recall where he heard that.
Shortly after WikiLeaks released the emails, Alexandra Preate, a Trump campaign aide who worked for Bannon, texted Stone a two-word message: “well done,” according to evidence presented earlier in the trial.
Bannon’s testimony is bad news for Stone, who faces charges that he lied about several topics in 2017 testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. One of those alleged lies was Stone’s claim that he did not communicate with the Trump campaign regarding information Stone claimed to have about WikiLeaks. Bannon’s testimony could bolster the government’s case that Stone committed perjury.
But the testimony is also terrible news for Trump. Previously, prosecutors revealed that Stone and Trump spoke frequently during the 2016 campaign. Those include calls on June 14, 2016, the same day the Washington Post reported that the DNC had been hacked by Russia. On July 31, 2016—not long after WikiLeaks released thousands of DNC emails and documents stolen by the Russians, Stone spoke for about 10 minutes with Trump. Prosecutors don’t know what the men discussed in either call, but they implied that they believe the topic was the hacked emails.
In written answers to special counsel Robert Mueller, Trump stated, “I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with [Stone], nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign.” Trump may have avoid perjury by claiming a memory lapse, but the Stone case is making it hard to avoid concluding that Trump probably told a whopper to Mueller.
Prosecutors have also detailed contacts related to WikiLeaks between Stone and former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and Blackwater founder Erik Prince, a Trump campaign adviser. Stone now denies that he really had any inside information on WikiLeaks, and there’s no evidence he communicated directly with Assange. But multiple members of the Trump campaign apparently thought he was working with WikiLeaks to advance their cause. That sounds like attempted collusion.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Not surprisingly, most of them have nothing to do with the impropriety of the call itself.
House Democrats control the impeachment inquiry process but asked for Republican input on potential witnesses last week. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the highest-ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee that will be leading the public impeachment inquiry, sent the list to Democratic chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), along with a lengthy letter complaining about the unfairness of the inquiry to Trump. Nunes, who has long been one of Trump’s most ardent defenders, described the process thus far as “opaque and unfair,” writing, “Your actions have great damaged the integrity of the Intelligence Committee and any legitimacy of your ‘impeachment inquiry.”
While House Democrats have said they want to hear from key diplomatic personnel who may have been involved with the quid pro quo arrangement, in which Trump tried to use the threat of withholding American support for the beleaguered nation in its ongoing dispute with Russia in exchange for the Ukrainian president promising to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden. After initially objecting to the notion that there was such an arrangement, the GOP has now more or less acknowledged it occurred but insists that it was not improper. Nunes’ proposed witness list seems designed mostly to make the case against Hunter Biden and, of course, Hillary Clinton.
Most noteworthy on the list is the anonymous whistleblower whose concern after hearing Trump pressure Zelensky pushed Democrats into pursuing a possible impeachment. The whistleblower might make an obvious witness, given all he knows about the phone call, but Nunes’ reasoning is in keeping with the general Republican talking points in defending Trump. He states the president should be “afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers”—an allusion to the Sixth Amendment, which covers criminal prosecutions and not impeachment inquiries. Nunes also cites the whistleblower’s alleged “bias” against the president, the evidence of which is apparently that he is a registered Democrat (his attorney denies any political bias). Rather than grilling the whistleblower on Trump’s actions, Nunes’ main interest seems to be changing the subject.
Nunes also wants to hear from Alexandra Chalupa, a former employee of the US Embassy in Ukraine, who was also a former Democratic National Committee staffer. Conservative news outlets have pushed the somewhat muddled theory that Chalupa, while working at the embassy, was researching Paul Manafort’s activities in that country in the early 2010s and may have improperly passed that information to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. Chalupa has denied any wrongdoing, saying she did no opposition research for the DNC. The DNC has also denied any wrongdoing, noting that Democrats were investigating Trump and Manafort’s ties to Russia and Ukraine long before Chalupa was hired.
Without any hint of irony or further explanation, Nunes cited questions about what Chalupa did or didn’t do in 2016 as the reason she was needed to testify about Trump’s July 2019 call with Zelensky.
“Ms. Chalupa is a prime fact witness who can assist Congress and the American Public in better understanding the facts and circumstances surrounding the Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election,” Nunes wrote in his letter, highlighting a topic that is notably not part of the impeachment inquiry.
Nunes’ list also includes Biden’s son, Hunter, and Devon Archer, a former business partner of the younger Biden. Both sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, that Trump was pushing Zelensky to investigate as corrupt. Nunes wrote in his letter that testimony from the two men would “assist the American public in understanding the nature and extent of Ukraine’s pervasive corruption, information that bears directly on President Trump’s longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country.” Biden and Archer would seemingly fit into a strategy of not denying Trump took steps to pressure Zelensky into investigating a political opponent’s family, but rather excusing and contextualizing Trump’s behavior by arguing that the president’s actions were thoroughly justified because of Ukraine’s history of corruption.

This prompted the usual tiresome round of social media outrage, even though it was obvious from the start that Scorsese’s point depended entirely on the meaning of “cinema.” Sure enough, the whole affair went pffft when he eventually explained what he meant. His generation of filmmakers, Scorsese said, considered cinema to be high art. “There was some debate about that at the time, so we stood up for cinema as an equal to literature or music or dance.”
Since even ardent fans can’t seriously consider Marvel superhero movies to be high art, that was the end of this little kerfuffle. But then Scorsese said something more:
In other words, big tentpole movies are taking over the multiplex and leaving no room for small, high-quality films. But this got me thinking. Is it really true that Scorsese’s kind of cinema is being crowded out these days? Here are a few data points to consider. First, the total number of movie screens has increased steadily over the past few decades:
The share of movies that are sequels or adaptations or otherwise part of a franchise has stayed roughly flat over the past decade:
And the number of movies that are big studio releases has stayed about the same since 1995, while the number of indie releases has skyrocketed:
None of this gets us precisely to the problem Scorsese is talking about: namely that franchise movies are taking up all the screens. After all, the number of big studio releases may be the same as it was a couple of decades ago, but they open on more screens than they used to. Without more data, it’s impossible to say for sure how many screen-days are being dedicated to franchises vs. smaller pictures.
Still, given that the number of releases has been stable while the number of screens has doubled, the data suggests that tentpoles and franchises probably aren’t hogging up a bigger share of screens than in the past. Besides, if screens were truly becoming a lot scarcer, it’s hard to explain why the number of indie releases has tripled in the past two decades.
Don’t take any of this as conclusive. It’s just what I was able to find without going too far down a rabbit hole. If anyone knows where to find better data, let me know.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

He did not receive a warm welcome.

Then, he tried a Ultimate Fighting Championship fight at Madison Square Garden in his hometown of New York City. Also didn’t go well.

But today, after traveling on Air Force One all the way to the deep red state of Alabama, Trump finally found a crowd that was, mostly, happy to see him as the University of Alabama hosted rivals Louisiana State University.


In the first few minutes following his introduction, Tua Tagovailoa, the starting quarterback for Alabama, which is ranked number two in the nation and hasn’t trailed in a game at home since 2015, promptly threw an interception leading to an LSU touchdown. On the next drive, Alabama’s punter botched a kick and LSU took a 10-0 lead. They eventually recovered a bit but still trailed at the end of the first quarter.

“I want to tell them I’m back,” said Lula, as he is known, in a 45-minute speech to cheering supporters in front of a metalworkers union headquarters in São Bernardo do Campo.

The 74-year-old was imprisoned in 2018 after being found guilty of receiving bribes for public contracts. Lula has denied those charges, saying he was the victim of political persecution. “They didn’t arrest a man,” he said Friday after a judge ordered his release, “they tried to silence an idea and ideas don’t go away.”

And then Lula dropped a sizzle reel on Twitter.

Lula has received support on Twitter from leaders all over the world, including Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders.

Lula served as Brazil’s president from 2003 to 2010 and left the presidency with “sky-high approval ratings.” He won’t be able to run for office until 2025 because of Brazil’s so-called “clean record” law, which prevents candidates from running for public office for eight years if they’ve lost their political jobs because of corruption, but he’s already planning his political comeback.

Just today, a group of demonstrators arrived in DC after marching from New York City. Thousands more people across the United States are expected to take to the streets on Tuesday, when the court hears a suite of cases challenging whether the Trump administration acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner in canceling the program that shields more than 700,000 young people from deportation.
The Home Is Here marchers, among them one of the plaintiffs in the case, left New York City on Oct. 26 and arrived Sunday morning in DC, chanting and dancing. Supporters from California and other parts of the country also traveled to the nation’s capital, and earlier this week students walked out in support DACA. There’s a national call for students to walk out of school on Tuesday.


Here’s a DACA refresher ahead of the hearing:
On June 15, 2012 after months of pressure from immigration rights groups and in the midst of a heated re-election campaign, President Barack Obama signed an executive order that gave birth to DACA. The program allowed those who at the time were between the ages of 16 and 31, who were brought here as children, and who didn’t otherwise have immigration status, to apply for a two-year work permit that also protected them from deportation. They also had to meet a series of requirements and have no criminal record. Thousands received DACA in the coming years—they’re known popularly as Dreamers, a callback to the failed DREAM Act that offered similar but broader protections—although many struggled with the decision to apply in the first place because it was only a temporary status.
On the campaign trail in 2016 Trump threatened to end DACA, calling it an overreach by the Obama administration. Immediately after Trump’s election, DACA recipients felt scared and confused by their uncertain future. They were particularly vulnerable to deportation in the event that Trump took away their status; the government already had all of their information. Many were also afraid for their undocumented family members, who were now also exposed.
In office, Trump turned the rhetoric down a bit, saying said he would treat DACA recipients “with heart” and work with Congress on the matter. But in September 2017, the Trump administration announced it would cancel DACA. Courts quickly ruled that the administration did not have the authority to end DACA so abruptly and without adequate explanation, and the government was compelled to renew the program for those who had already been granted temporary protected status.
Since then lower courts have ruled against the Trump administration, saying his move was “arbitrary and capricious.” It’s been two years of limbo for DACA recipients.
Tuesday morning the Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to wind down DACA is lawful and judicially reviewable. The court is not expected to make a decision until the spring.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But low milk prices and chronic overproduction are squeezing small- and mid-sized dairy farms, which are shutting down at a rate of more than two per day. Massive dairy operations, meanwhile, continue to proliferate, concentrating manure and causing tension with neighbors over putrid odors and fouled water. This week, these twin crises have inflamed a long-simmering squabble between Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and the GOP-controlled Wisconsin Senate.
In January, Evers’ appointed Brad Pfaff to lead the state’s department of agriculture, trade, and consumer protection. Pfaff, who grew up on a Wisconsin dairy farm, had previously served as an administrator in President Barack Obama’s Department of Agriculture and deputy chief of staff to US Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.).
But in Wisconsin, the governor’s choices for cabinet posts like ag department chief are subject to approval by the full senate. And Evers faces a senate still stinging from the midterms: In 2018, he narrowly defeated GOP stalwart Scott Walker, who had served as governor from 2011 to 2018, and had gained national fame for his attacks on public-sector unions and his hot pursuit of the anti-tax and deregulatory agenda favored by his financial backers, the Koch brothers.
Still under GOP control, the senate has refused to vote on most of Evers’ cabinet picks, leaving them to serve as acting heads of their departments. And on Tuesday, the senate effectively fired Pfaff. It voted Pfaff out along party lines, 19-14—the first time the legislative body has voted to remove a governor’s cabinet pick in at least three decades. For now, Pfaff’s deputy agriculture director, who isn’t subject to approval by the senate, will run the department.
The Republicans’ complaints with Pfaff were two-fold. In July, Pfaff rebuked the senate for refusing to release $100,000 in allocated state funding for mental health services for farmers. Since milk prices started to slide in 2015, America’s Dairyland (Wisconsin’s official nickname) has seen about a quarter of its dairy farms fold. As the attrition grinds on, calls to a mental-health hotline for farmers have spiked, and there’s evidence of an uptick in farmer suicides (though precise data is hard to come by). “There’s no two ways about it: Republicans have chosen to leave farmers behind,” Pfaff said back in July, after Republican lawmakers declined to release the funds. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald shot back that Pfaff’s comments were “flippant” and “beneath your position.” The senate ultimately released the funds in September.
Pfaff had also been pushing through new rules on large dairy farms, forcing them to keep manure pits at least 600 feet from neighbors’ property lines (current regulations require a 350 foot setback). The dairy industry vigorously opposed by the changes, and the senate Republicans declared them “burdensome.”
The Wisconsin Farmers Union, which represents small- and mid-sized farms, supports manure reform. According to Kara O’Connor, the union’s government relations director, the state’s manure pit regulations have not changed since 2006 and “are desperately in need of an update, because they’re deeply out of touch with the reality that’s unfolding in rural communities.” The number of massive dairies that confine several thousand cows has expanded steadily since the current rules were formulated, and “we have a lot of members who have expressed deep concerns about odor from these operations,” she said.
The tension between Wisconsin’s governor and his legislature is playing out in the hothouse of national presidential politics. Sen. Fitzgerald, who spearheaded Pfaff’s firing, is now running for Congress. He has denounced impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump as a “political witch hunt” and a desperate attempt to deny Trump a second term.
And a top Trump official has weighed in on Wisconsin’s dairy crisis. Responding to a reporter’s question about the plight of the state’s farms at the World Dairy Expo in Madison in early October, US Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue declared that “in America, the big get bigger and the small go out…I don’t think in America we, for any small business, we have a guaranteed income or guaranteed profitability.”
Days later, Gov. Evers lashed out at Perdue. “He kind of put the pox on small farming in the state,” Evers told reporters, according to the Journal Sentinel. “Are they struggling? Absolutely. But I think at the end of the day we need to get behind them rather than saying, ah maybe you should go larger… I, frankly, resent that the Department of Agriculture secretary from the federal government came in and kind of lambasted them.”
Back in 2016, Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes. Four years earlier, then-President Barack Obama took the state by more than 200,000 votes. According to New York Times electoral analyst Nate Cohn, Wisconsin is a toss-up for 2020, with former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) holding slim leads in polls over Trump, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) locked in a dead heat with the president. Warren and Sanders  have both called for policies that stabilize prices for farmers, an idea that’s increasingly popular in Wisconsin dairy country. Over the past two years, members of the Wisconsin Farmers Union and the more more industry-aligned Wisconsin Farm Bureau both voted to express tentative support for supply management—an idea embraced by Canadian dairy farmers but widely seen as radical in the United States.
“Until recently, dairy farmers have been hesitant to support supply management because of this thought that ‘getting government involved’ was going to put them out of business,” O’Connor of the Wisconsin Farmers Union said. “But dairy farmers are walking up to the fact that the economic climate will put them out of business a lot more swiftly and efficiently than any government policy every has.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Driving along County Road 28 south of Platteville, the signs of Colorado’s oil and gas boom are everywhere you look. Storage tanks and wellheads dot the horizon. Bundles of pipe sit by the roadside, waiting to become pipelines. Drilling rigs loom behind enormous brown temporary sound barriers, a stone’s throw from homes and businesses.
This infrastructure is impossible to miss, but the methane that leaks from it can be much harder to detect. That’s why Greg Rieker and a colleague are out here on a cold, sun-drenched morning in the middle of the Denver-Julesburg Basin—one of the nation’s fracking hotspots—fine-tuning their frequency comb laser.
Standing atop a small trailer housing the $150,000 device, Rieker gestures across a grassy expanse toward a well pad half a mile away. “We’ve used this system to pinpoint a leak to about a 5-square-meter area,” he says. “It’s a question of, when leaks start, seeing them and sizing them properly so we can alert an operator there’s a problem. There are 20,000 wells out there. This is a Colorado-grown solution, using Colorado technology.”
Rieker is a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder and chief technology officer of LongPath Technologies, a startup that aims to provide oil and gas companies with a new method for detecting methane leaks from their operations. He is among a growing cadre of scientists and entrepreneurs working to develop and deploy novel technologies to address the growing issue of methane leaks across the fossil fuel supply chain.
In the United States, fugitive emissions from the oil and gas industry total an estimated 13 million metric tons per year, amounting to $2 billion in lost revenue; globally, the value of leaking gas is $30 billion.
Methane is a potent contributor to climate change, trapping 86 times as much heat as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. It is responsible for about a quarter of total atmospheric warming to date, but it only lasts about a decade in the atmosphere, making reducing methane emissions a relatively fast-acting lever for climate action.In the United States, fugitive emissions from the oil and gas industry total an estimated 13 million metric tons per year, amounting to $2 billion in lost revenue; globally, the value of leaking gas is $30 billion.
That climate impact was the primary reason the US Environmental Protection Agency, under President Barack Obama, issued a rule in 2016 that set limits on methane emissions from new and modified oil and gas sources and required that operators monitor and repair leaking equipment. In August, President Trump’s EPA announced a replacement rule that would discard those requirements, effectively freeing companies from the obligation of regularly monitoring and plugging methane leaks from their operations.
Oil and gas giants like BP, ExxonMobil, and Shell have opposed the recent rollback, and pledged to continue with voluntary measures to cut their own methane emissions. Behind those pledges lies the fear that not tackling these leaks will undermine the industry-promoted narrative of natural gas as a “clean” fuel and invite tighter restrictions down the road.
A study published in Science last year estimated that total methane emissions from US oil and gas are 60 percent higher than EPA inventories—equivalent to 2.3 percent of natural gas production leaking into the atmosphere. If companies are sincere about stopping those leaks, industry experts say there is an urgent need to incorporate new monitoring technologies into their vast operations, from the wellhead to pipelines, to compressor stations to storage facilities. “When you look at the future, the Achilles heel of the gas industry is the methane emissions,” executive director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said at an American Petroleum Institute forum in September.
Rieker is betting that his laser-based system can catch leaks more effectively and affordably than the current industry standard, which involves using a $100,000 infrared camera to randomly scan a well pad’s welter of valves, tanks, separators, and compressors a few times a year. The camera’s ability to detect leaks is highly dependent on weather conditions and the operator’s skill; it also only collects data as a single snapshot in time, and doesn’t indicate the size of a leak. Rieker’s frequency comb laser, meanwhile, sweeps continuously across the plain for weeks and months, hunting for and tallying up errant methane molecules.
Dozens of other entrepreneurs are also working to find new ways to detect fugitive emissions by making devices autonomous, cheaper, more precise, better at catching big leaks—or all of the above. Many of these novel solutions are emerging from the labs and office parks of northeastern Colorado. As Washington retreats from monitoring methane, the state’s Front Range has become the de facto capital of methane detectives.
Part of the reason is the state has the toughest methane leak regulations in the country. (The Obama-era EPA modeled its own proposed methane rule on Colorado’s.) Those rules were adopted in 2014 to tackle the persistent ozone pollution that plagues the Denver metropolitan area and other parts of the state, largely as a result of fossil fuel production. Methane contributes to ground-level ozone formation, and is also co-emitted with other volatile organic compounds that are ozone precursors.
But there are other factors spurring the research here, too. The proximity of dense oil and gas fields, fast-growing residential areas like Longmont and Boulder, and premier research institutions like University of Colorado (CU) Boulder, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have made this part of Colorado both a proving ground and a hotbed of innovation around leak detection.
Dirk Richter is a research scientist at CU’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, where he designs and builds high-precision instruments for atmospheric sampling in a lab just across campus from Rieker’s. He’s also a founder of Quanta3, a startup that he and a colleague launched in his garage to develop a system that could provide continuous, ground-based monitoring of gas leaks.
The industry, he says, wants accurate, low-maintenance, autonomous systems that can be left in the field, quietly sending data to the cloud without requiring frequent checkups. Whereas Rieker’s system is the first-ever field application of some Nobel Prize-winning physics, Richter’s device relies on tunable laser diodes, which are widely used in fiber optics cables. These have the advantage of being lightweight, durable, and proven from many years of development for telecommunications.
“We are focused on making rugged sensors for an environment that’s not very kind,” Richter says. “Oil and gas fields are windy, dusty, hot or very cold places.” The other overriding constraint, of course, is cost. “Laser spectrometers on aircraft can cost $250,000 each. We can offer a solution that in volume costs $3 per site per day, less than a cup of coffee to operate.”
Fiji George, the director of climate and sustainability at Cheniere Energy, the biggest LNG exporter in the US, says that if they become mature, commercially viable technologies, continuous monitoring solutions such as Rieker’s and Richter’s are the “holy grail” for the industry.
Both startups have ongoing field pilots with industry partners: LongPath, Rieker’s company, has field trials underway monitoring gas storage facilities in Colorado and California. Quanta3, Richter’s company, has partnered with big fossil fuel firms like Equinor (formerly Statoil) and Shell to test its systems in the Eagle Ford Shale formation in Texas and in Alberta, Canada, respectively. (The sensor in the Eagle Ford kept transmitting its automated updates throughout Hurricane Harvey in 2017.)
Many of the new detection offerings involve variations on laser absorption spectroscopy—an established technique that combines a laser source, mirrors, and detectors to measure the amount of light absorbed by a gas—all hooked up to software that translates that signal into a methane concentration number. Out of an office next to the tiny Boulder airport, Stephen Conley runs Scientific Aviation. He and a small team of aviator-scientists operate a fleet of small aircraft to provide emissions monitoring services to industry and regulators alike. A seasoned atmospheric scientist and a veteran pilot, Conley was the first person to detect and measure the biggest methane leak ever recorded in the US, which started at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Southern California in October 2015.
Earlier this year, Conley rolled out a new service: drones mounted with lightweight laser-spectrometer sensors and air sampling canisters to monitor methane emissions much closer to their sources. While an airplane-mounted system like the one he flew thousands of feet above Aliso Canyon can find leaks as small as 10 kilograms per hour, his drones, he says, can detect much smaller ones, down to 10 grams per hour. Scientific Aviation has also chosen to make its designs and software open source. “We published our methodology, so anyone in the world can do this,” says Conley. “We’re not here just to make money. We’re here to reduce global methane emissions. We believe in the cause.”
Not all new solutions depend on laser spectroscopy, however. Ball Aerospace, headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado, has developed a LiDAR system for aerial, high-resolution mapping of leaks. Some other firms are pursuing solutions that adapt electrochemical sensors or handheld gas sensors used to detect alcohol levels in drivers to sniff out methane.
Most of these Colorado innovators test their technologies at the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center (METEC), a facility on the outskirts of Fort Collins, funded by the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) program. On the surface, the METEC facility looks just like the drilling sites out on County Road 28. But there is no oil or gas being pumped to the surface—only methane in carefully controlled releases from 200 different leak points. With the capacity to run demanding, complex simulations where visiting crews must hunt for multiple small leaks at a time, METEC is the only facility of its kind in the country. “I’m here to pour cold water on everything,” says Dan Zimmerle, the Colorado State University researcher who runs METEC.
METEC tests both stationary systems like Rieker’s as well as mobile ones, including aerial systems mounted on helicopters and, increasingly, drones. “There’s just been an explosion in the number of technologies and the range of systems you see,” says Arvind Ravikumar, an assistant professor of energy engineering at Harrisburg University who led an extensive field test study of different methane monitoring technologies at METEC last year.
This surge of invention “presents a huge opportunity to reduce emissions at lower cost and much faster than we used to before,” says Ravikumar. “If we’re going to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, our current practice of fossil fuel use cannot continue. But we have to strongly consider what’s doable with oil and gas—we’re not going to turn off all these pipes tomorrow. Every ton of methane and carbon dioxide reduced is an advantage in the long-term climate mitigation challenge.”
Yet industry experts say that without federal regulations to force operators to invest, there’s a limit to how much these ventures can grow. Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, and other fossil fuel companies issued a wave of press releases after both the EPA rollback in August and during United Nations’ climate meetings in New York in September, pledging to continue their voluntary efforts to cut methane emissions. But so far, these pledges haven’t translated into substantial investments in new methane leak technologies.
“Based on the press releases, I should have sold thousands of sensors,” Richter says. “They’re not backing it up…with investments of their own. I think federal regulation is still the required means to make them actually do something. When there is a rule that forces everybody to do the same thing—that’s when they will invest.”
If that investment materializes, the benefits could multiply even beyond the removal of super-warming pollutants from the atmosphere. With close to a million active wells around the US that will require ongoing monitoring, and 300,000 miles of interstate gas pipelines—not to mention thousands of compressor stations and over 100 liquefied natural gas facilities—methane detection using all these new tools could become a significant economic engine.
“These are jobs that would happen in west Texas, rural Colorado, rural Arkansas,” Ravikumar says. “It has the potential to bring in a lot of economic activity, with contractors out there on a regular basis and a whole host of support services that would need to come up in those regions.”
What’s more, scientists, entrepreneurs, and industry analysts see room for many different methane-sensing technologies to find a market. “This problem won’t be solved by any one technology,” Rieker says. “It’ll be a suite that covers the entire supply chain.” Drones are better for sniffing leaks along pipelines, whereas his laser is much better suited to monitoring a dense field of wells or a storage facility. “It’s a problem we can solve and we’ll all be a lot better off for it.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

This is not a controversial position. In September 2018, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, alongside some of the foremost election and information security experts in the country slammed the idea, noting that despite whatever illusions of convenience it may provide, it opens the door to a wide range of security vulnerabilities. Their conclusion was simple: “secure Internet voting will likely not be feasible in the near future.” And just this summer, after more than two years of investigation, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a report on Russia’s 2016 election interference operations, which included a warning to states to “resist pushes for online voting,” noting that nobody has proven that it can be done safely.
You wouldn’t know that if you listened to representatives from Voatz, an app-based company that claims it can securely administer online elections. The company’s product requires users to upload a government photo ID, and then uses a video selfie along with fingerprint and face scans to verify voters’ identity. The company says it then records the user’s vote on an immutable blockchain, a technology that creates records on a distributed system, making manipulation of the data virtually impossible. Voatz boasts its system stores votes “on multiple, geographically diverse verifying servers,” and claims that their systems have been regularly tested by simulated hackings and audited by independent third parties.
On Thursday, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) called the company’s bluff, asking the Department of Defense and the National Security Agency to conduct a cybersecurity audit of the company. In a letter calling for the audit, Wyden says the company won’t release the results of its own security audits and won’t even identify whoever it hired to conduct them. “This level of secrecy hardly inspires confidence,” he writes, noting the DoD recently joined other federal agencies in issuing a statement affirming that Russia, China, Iran, and other “malicious actors” are actively working to attack US elections.
An NSA spokesperson confirmed the agency had received the letter, but declined to comment further. The Department of Defense also confirmed receipt, saying it would respond to Wyden.
In a statement posted to the company’s blog after Mother Jones asked for a response to Wyden’s letter, the company said that it had not been contacted by the senator’s office but welcomed “any and all additional security audits by the Department of Defense and NSA regarding our platform.”
While it did not respond directly to Wyden’s charge that its audit results and auditors remain private, the statement said the company is “committed to providing as much transparency as possible about our system, while at the same time needing to protect our intellectual property as one of the youngest election companies in the country.”
The company says it has run “54 successful elections (public and private),” and pilot programs in West Virginia, Oregon, and elsewhere—including a student council race—primarily helping voters who are overseas and in the military cast ballots. It says “attempts to tamper with the system were actively thwarted” during the 2018 West Virginia pilot, a reference to what was likely a group of election security students looking at the app’s vulnerabilities. It also notes that it participates in the HackerOne bug bounty program, which facilitates the reporting of vulnerabilities that the company allows outsiders to test.
The West Virginia officials say they were happy with the program but acknowledge lingering doubts about its security. Last year after the state’s pilot, a state official told the Washington Post in response to questions about Voatz’s vulnerabilities that while the test had gone smoothly and was “very successful,” the secretary of state “has never and will never advocate that this is a solution for mainstream voting.”

That’s Actually a Big Deal.,Will Peischel,MotherJones,Environment,"During a conference on climate change and the economy in San Francisco, one year after the deadly Campfire’s wildfire smoke made the city’s air quality among the worst on the planet, the Federal Reserve announced that it would incorporate climate change into its considerations when making policy decisions. The choice stands in stark contrast with the Trump administration, which maintains that climate change is a hoax despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The announcement was made during a speech by Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who said taking climate change seriously would be central to the future of the US economy.
Ann Saphir reported on the announcement for Reuters:
But what does this announcement mean, in a practical sense? Monolithic financial institutions don’t typically turn on a dime, and according to David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal & Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institute, this will not result in different actions by the Fed in the near term. The task of implementing new monetary policy is deliberate and incremental, but that doesn’t mean this announcement isn’t notable. “The significance isn’t that it’s gonna change anything on regulation, supervision or monetary policy,” Wessel says. “They stopped pretending that this is someone else’s problem.”
Wessel says there’s serious weight behind a financial institution as large and respected as the Fed weighing in on this issue. “The Fed board of governors in DC has 402 PhD economists,” he says. “Doing something like this does raise the visibility of the issue. It adds to the seriousness: Sober people are taking climate change seriously.” Though sober people within the banking world have been taking climate change seriously for some time. The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a cooperative effort between banks from some of the world’s largest economies—like Germany and England, with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank taking observer status—was established in 2017 to align the financial world with the Paris Climate Agreement. The Fed has been a notable outlier, until now. Along with announcing the bank’s new stance on climate, Brainard expressed an interest in the central bank participating with the NGFS in the future.
The Fed taking those proactive measures is something of an anomaly, Wessel says, noting that the NGFS member banks are all parts of governments that have recognized the urgency of addressing climate change. “I think that’s why other central banks are more ahead,” he says. “They are thinking about this.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But a majority of Republicans say they think that a president trying to use the full weight of America’s international power to attack a domestic political opponent is normal.
The poll, conducted early this week by Vox/PerryUndem/Ipsos, was somewhat reassuring about the public believing there should be limits on a president in that it found that a large majority of Americans—71 percent—say some way to remove politicians who do wrong is essential. But when the pollsters started asking more specific questions about what constitutes an impeachable offense, Republican respondents started showing increasingly more tolerance for bad presidential behavior.
For example, 88 percent of Republicans think using the Oval Office to enrich yourself is an impeachable offense (versus 95 percent of Democrats) and  67 percent percent of Republicans think abusing presidential power for political advantage is impeachable (versus 93 percent of Democrats and 75 percent of independents). But what about being dishonest to the American people? Seventy-four percent of Democrats found that impeachable as did 56 percent of independents—but only 50 percent of Republicans.
And while most independents and 77 percent of Democrats think an American president using his power to force foreign countries to investigate a political rival—as a growing mountain of evidence is showing Donald Trump did with Ukraine this summer—only 22 percent of Republicans thought it was a “high crime and misdemeanor,” and, yes, impeachable.
Only 22 percent.
Why such a high tolerance for such norm busting that Republicans like Mitt Romney called Trump’s attempts to force other countries to dig up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden “wrong and appalling”? And Romney wasn’t too far out on a limb with that—65 percent of Americans say it’s “morally wrong” to do just thaat. But, here comes the apparent cynicism: According to the poll, a whopping 65 percent of Republicans in this country think it’s the kind of thing presidents “do all the time.” The numbers are virtually reversed for Democrats with 63 percent saying it is not something presidents do all the time; only 37 percent of Independents thought it was normal behavior for a president.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Only six candidates turned out for the first ever presidential forum on environmental justice at South Carolina State University on Friday night.
Issues such as lead-contaminated water, food deserts, childhood asthma and proximity to polluting chemical plants and industrial pig farms disproportionately affect low-income communities, tribal nations and people of colour.
The Democratic candidates who participated were Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.); former members of Congress John Delaney and Joe Sestak; the billionaire Tom Steyer; and the author Marianne Williamson.
Warren, who launched an ambitious climate and environmental justice plan last month, said a third of the $3tn she has pledged to spend combating global heating over the next decade would be ring fenced for communities devastated by generations of environmental racism.
She pledged to tackle big corporations including big polluters by introducing anti-corruption legislation on her first day as president.
Asked about Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg’s recently leaked comment that a Warren presidency would “suck” for the company, she responded: “Boo-hoo.”
Steyer, the hedge-fund manager turned environmental philanthropist who bankrolled an “impeach Trump” ad campaign, said he would declare a state of emergency on his first day in office to tackle the climate crisis.
He compared current environmental inequalities to Jim Crow segregation laws implemented after the abolition of slavery, when people of color and native Americans had inadequate and inferior public services.
“If we’re going to repair these injustices, the people affected have to be at the front of the line for green jobs,” said Steyer.
The Flint water scandal in 2014 propelled environmental inequalities on to the national stage. Since then, it has emerged that thousands of water sources in communities across the US are contaminated with lead. This includes Newark, New Jersey, where Booker was mayor. He pledged to fund a national programme to replace lead pipes.
The New Jersey senator, who founded the first environmental justice caucus, is vegan, because of what he says to the cruel and polluting “corporate animal industry” responsible for massive greenhouse gas emissions and health problems in nearby communities.
Booker defended supporting nuclear power, a position criticized by environmental justice groups given the health risks posed by nuclear waste, arguing that it was the only way to meet climate targets within 12 years.
“Fifty percent of our non-carbon energy producing capacity come from nuclear,” he said. “So I’m a realist.”
Delaney, a former congressman from Maryland, said cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 would be impossible under the Green New Deal, a broad social and economic pact supported by high-profile Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The deal plans legislation to achieve universal healthcare and higher minimum wages as well as clean energy, sustainable infrastructure and green jobs.
Delaney said he wants to cancel fossil-fuel tax subsidies, freeing up money to invest in technology to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
The environmental justice forum was hosted by the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and leaders from frontline and tribal communities, civil rights, youth and environmental organizations.
It was moderated by Mustafa Santiago Ali, a former Environmental Protection Agency official, and Amy Goodman from the independent news organization Democracy Now.
The caucus will host a forum on gun violence and mental health next month.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Bolton has said that if a judge rules he can ignore a White House order to keep quiet, he would appear before Congress. But the Associated Press reported on Saturday that Bolton has signed a multi-million dollar book deal. Even if Trump can keep his mustachioed former aide out of the witness seat, it looks like he’s going to join a long list of former White House advisers to tell the inside story.
According to the AP, Bolton got a $2 million advance from Simon & Schuster, and while it’s not clear what he will say in the book, the price tag suggests it will be a pretty juicy story.
Bolton once would have been an unlikely candidate to be either the Democrat’s potential star witness or the author of a Trump tell-all. For years, he has had a reputation as one of the most conservative and hawkish Republicans in Washington, from his work as ambassador to the United Nations under the Bush administration to serving Trump in the White House. But he and Trump clashed often over Bolton’s mistrust of Trump’s favorite dictators in Russia and North Korea. And Bolton was reportedly horrified at Trump’s attempts to force the Ukrainians to carry his political water. According to other witnesses who have testified before the Democratic impeachment inquiry, after catching wind that EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland and White House acting chief-of-staff Mick Mulvaney had discussed the plot to pressure Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Bolton snarled “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.”
The news of Bolton’s book deal comes the day after his attorney dropped hints that his client knows a lot more about the president’s efforts in Ukraine than has previously been revealed. Bolton was scheduled to give a deposition to House Democrats on Thursday but didn’t show up. The White House has ordered former staffers to not cooperate, but Biden’s attorney has said that Bolton will testify anyway, if a judge settles the dispute between the executive and the legislative branch.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In the latest reinvention of reality from the campaign of Newt Gingrich, the flailing presidential contender today argued that the commercial he cut with Nancy Pelosi a few years back about working together on climate change was “misconstrued.” He was just doing it to fight the vast left wing conspiracy!
He was asked about the ad for Al Gore’s “We Can Solve It” campaign in an appearance on WGIR radio in New Hampshire on Tuesday. His response (via The Hill):
Riiight. Of course, Gingrich went on to make abolishing the EPA a central issue of his campaign, so there have long been doubts about his sincerity in that particular ad campaign. When the ad was broadcast back in 2008, even some Republicans thought talking about climate change would was cool. Now the right is whole-heartedly devoted to bashing any and all environmental idea/effort.
The change of tune hasn’t, however, stopped Gingrich from investing in clean energy technology. As Politico reports today, Gingrich has a sizable investment in renewable energy technologies like solar power and biofuels.

Although his presidential campaign has all but imploded, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has at least one more big plan to boost his chances in the Republican primaries: an appeal to Asian-American voters. His staff already has him committed to a new batch of outreach efforts in Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in Hawaii, California, and—at the end of August—Virginia. Politico reports:
(Emphasis mine.)
Jonathan Chait poked fun at this strategy back in early June, when he wrote about the improbability of Gingrich emerging victorious in Iowa after “mobilizing a wave of Chinese-Americans” to attend a “caucus that notoriously caters to a small cadre of motivated partisans.”
Newt Gingrich’s master plan has just one major shortcoming: He has no real appeal to Asian-American voters. It’s not him, really; it’s his party affiliation (though the whole “we would never accept the Japanese putting up a site next to Pearl Harbor” thing from last summer certainly didn’t do him any favors). These days, Asian-Americans vote overwhelmingly Democratic: In 2008, they helped put Barack Obama over the top, and thanks to the moderately liberal (as well as pro-immigration) consensus growing among the demographic’s young generation, the right lost out on those votes over half a decade ago.
In trying to seize upon the conservative sliver of an already tiny ethnic population, Newt’s strategic gamble just comes off as an exercise in the kind of futility that the Gingrich campaign has come to typify. Then again, if you’re going to fall flat, you might as well do it in Hawaii.

Newt Gingrich has officially lost the future. The former Speaker of the House raised $52 million over the last four years through his political action committee, American Solutions for Winning the Future—but now that Gingrich has jumped ship to run his own (floundering) presidential campaign, the 527 he founded and chaired has officially shut down. Per Peter Stone:
As Alex Burns notes, Gaylord had initially planned to keep the PAC afloat while Gingrich ran for president; instead, it’s become yet another casualty of his disastrous campaign.

Perhaps the strangest moment of Thursday’s Fox News/Google debate came when Texas Gov. Rick Perry was asked who he would pick as his running mate. His reply: “I don’t know how you would do this, but if you could take Herman Cain and mate him up with Newt Gingrich, I think you would have a couple of really interesting guys to work with.”
Former Massachussetts Governor Mitt Romney quipped, “There are a couple of images I’m going to have a hard time getting out of my mind.”
I suspect Perry’s plan to “mate up” Gingrich and Cain (who actually did say he would choose Gingrich as his running mate) doesn’t actually signify a shift in Perry’s views on marriage equality. But if the image of a mutant spawn of Cain and Gingrich running alongside Perry doesn’t frighten you, consider that Perry didn’t exactly excel in his animal science major in college, receiving “a D in veterinary anatomy, a F in a second course on organic chemistry and a C in animal breeding.” We can only hope that when this Hermewt Caingrich emerges, Tokyo will be spared.

Probably! Texas Republicans, you’ll remember, have a bit of a history when it comes to this kind of thing. Last December, conservatives activists, with a few allies in the legislature, attempted to replace Republican Speaker of the House Phil Strauss, who is Jewish, with an Evangelical Christian. As one one such activist told the Texas Observer, “[Jews are] some of my best friends. I’m not bigoted at all; I’m not racist.” But—and this is a big hang-up, really—”I got into politics to put Christian conservatives into office.”

UPDATE: On Nov. 4, 2014, Cotton won a Senate seat in Arkansas, defeating incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor. We’ll update this post again when he runs for president.
UPDATE: On May 22, 2012, Cotton won the GOP nomination in Arkansas’ 4th congressional district. On November 6, he won the general election. Then, on July 31, 2013, he announced he will run for the Senate seat currently held by Democrat Mark Pryor.
In 2006, Tom Cotton, a twentysomething US Army lieutenant serving in Iraq, wrote an open letter calling for the prosecution and imprisonment of two of the New York Times‘ most prominent reporters, Eric Lichtblau and James Risen, who had just broken a major story about how the government was tracking terrorist financing. The letter, which also called for the prosecution of Bill Keller, the Times‘ then-executive editor, was initially published on the conservative blog PowerLine but soon went viral.
Now, half a decade later, Cotton is running for Congress as a Republican. He has a good chance of winning. Mike Ross, the Democratic incumbent in Arkansas’ 4th District, is retiring, and Cotton has earned solid establishment support (and a fawning Weekly Standard profile) in his race for the GOP nomination. So far, Cotton’s past as an internet meme-generator and amateur media critic has gone largely unnoticed.
Five years ago, however, Cotton’s criticism of the Gray Lady made him into a minor celebrity in the right-wing blogosphere. On June 22, 2006, Lichtblau and Risen published an article revealing the details of a top-secret Treasury Department program to disrupt terrorists’ finances—The Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, also known as the SWIFT program for the financial transactions database on which it relied. Two months earlier, the pair had won the Pulitzer Prize for their stories disclosing other secret Bush administration programs, including the National Security Agency’s warrantless wiretapping.
Conservatives were outraged by the Times‘ reporting—even though the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post reported very similar stories the same day. Vice President Dick Cheney complained about the Times‘ Pulitzer, and Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) called the paper “treasonous,” as did Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.). Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.) wrote a letter to the speaker of the House calling for the Times congressional press passes to be withdrawn, and the Weekly Standard‘s Heather MacDonald led an article with the claim that “The New York Times is a national security threat.” Ann Coulter said the Times‘ staff should be “executed.” Even President Bush weighed in, calling the paper’s decision to publish “disgraceful.”
“Gosh, we’re hated,” wrote the Times‘ Nick Kristof. (Howard Kurtz, then of the Post, had a great column on all this at the time, and Media Matters compiled a good summary of some of the other conservative reactions to Lichtblau and Risen’s story.)
But few of the right’s complaints about the Times‘ story got more traction—or struck more of a chord—than Cotton’s letter. At the time, the PowerLine blog was riding high on its 2004 takedown of CBS anchor Dan Rather, and Cotton’s piece received widespread circulation. Several papers reprinted the letter in full. Right-wing talker Hugh Hewitt mentioned it on CNN’s Reliable Sources, complaining that the Times hadn’t responded, and the Washington Times highlighted Cotton’s argument in a story on the controversy.
Here’s an excerpt from the letter:
Outside experts are skeptical of the idea of prosecuting journalists for publishing secrets. “The espionage act has never been used against journalists,” explains Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University. “When you accuse investigative journalists of espionage, you are essentially saying that they’re working for another power, or aiding the enemy. That is culture war tactics taken to an extreme.”
Lichtblau and Risen were never, of course, charged with espionage. But the Times took the controversy seriously enough that Keller penned a lengthy op-ed explaining how the paper made decisions about publishing secrets. In the piece, Keller noted that in September 2003 Treasury Secretary John Snow—one of the GOPers who had complained about the Times story—had invited reporters from the Times and other papers on a “six-day tour to show off the department’s efforts to track terrorist financing.” Keller’s implication was clear: The conservative attack on the Times‘ reporting was insincere and opportunistic.*
Keller declined to comment for this story. “I’ve said my piece more than once on the Swift story and on the notion of using the Espionage Act against journalists,” he wrote in an email. But Lichtblau sent this response:
“Tom speaks his mind on topics about which he’s passionate—including the Times‘ disclosures of highly classified national security matters,” a spokesman for Cotton’s campaign said Wednesday. “Tom is confident that the Times will respect his rights of free speech and cover his campaign in a fair manner consistent with journalistic ethics.”
Steven Aftergood, an expert in government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, says he doesn’t necessarily agree with the Times‘ decision to publish but that Cotton’s legal judgment is lacking. “Should the Times have been indicted and prosecuted? Of course not,” Aftergood said, laughing. “To believe in the free press means to allow for the exercise of editorial judgment. If you want to say people cannot choose to publish such information, then you don’t believe in a free press.”
“Advising voters what to do about” Cotton’s history with the First Amendment “would not be my place,” Rosen says. “But should this be part of the public record? Absolutely.”
*The drama didn’t end there, however. In October 2006, the Times‘ public editor, Byron Calame, wrote a column retracting his earlier support for publishing the TFTP story. Keller fired back the next month, slamming Calame’s “revisionist epiphany” in a letter.
Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Eric Lichtblau and James Risen were awarded their Pulitzer Prize in 2006 after their story on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program was published. The Pulitzer winners were actually announced about two months earlier. The sentence has been corrected.

Mississippi voters overwhelmingly rejected a ballot measure that would have granted full rights to a fertilized egg on Tuesday, with 58 percent of the state voting against the amendment. Activists on both sides of the battle were watching the state as a test case for other state-level initiatives that would outlaw all forms of abortion. Perhaps it’s worth looking, then, at why it didn’t pass in one of the most conservative states in the country.
The primary reason for the measure’s failure was overreach. In recent weeks, opponents of the measure made the case to the public that it wasn’t really just about abortion, but could also have far-reaching impacts on birth control, in vitro fertilization, and a doctor’s ability to provide care for pregnant women. Nsombi Lambright, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, pointed to the many grassroots and medical groups that got involved in the debate that were outside of the traditional abortion rights supporters like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood. In the past weeks, those groups were also knocking on doors, appearing in public forums, and making phone calls.
The Mississippi Nurses Association and the Mississippi chapter of the American Congress of Obstetrician Gynecologists came out against the measure, as did the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. The Mississippi State Medical Association also declined to endorse it, with the group’s president expressing concern about the “unintended consequences” of the measure and that the “medical judgment of well-intentioned physicians could be brought into question” if it passed.
A group of doctors also came out against the measure in a press conference at the state capitol. Dr. Randall Hines, a Flowood, Mississippi-based OB/GYN who specializes in infertility treatments, tells Mother Jones that the testimonials on Facebook and other social media tools from women were another key factor in the measure’s defeat. “The number of people who themselves, a family member, or a close friend has experienced infertility…we’re talking about a big chunk of the population,” Hines says. “I think that was overwhelmingly what got this thing defeated.”
Hines also cited the involvement of grassroots parents groups like Parents Against MS 26, an effort started by Atlee Breland, a mother of three who dealt with infertility. “The way I built my family was under threat,” Breland said. “I couldn’t let that go.” She launched a website with the stories of women who had undergone fertility treatments, been through rapes, or suffered traumatic miscarriages. Many of the women described themselves as firmly pro-life, but concerned about the broader reach of measure.
The measure also split the anti-abortion community. The National Right to Life declined to endorse it, as did the bishop of the state diocese of the Catholic Church. For some anti-abortion activists, the problem with the measure was that it took a sledgehammer to Roe v. Wade at a time when most national anti-abortion groups have opted for a scalpel. Had it passed, it would have ended up in court inevitably. As a result, some people who may have voted for a measure limiting abortion rights ended up voting against Initiative 26. Other religious leaders, including the bishops of the Episcopalian and Methodist churches in the state, also came out against it.
Alexa Kolbi-Molina, a staff attorney at the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, notes that this is the fifth time that voters have rejected an all-out ban on abortion at the polls, which should be a sign to “personhood” advocates. Both Colorado and South Dakota have twice rejected similarly blunt measures. “When you ask people, they trust women, they want women to make decisions themselves, and they want the government to keep out,” she said. “If it wasn’t clear before, it should be now, that nobody supports this extremist agenda.”

At Wednesday night’s GOP presidential debate in Michigan, Newt Gingrich was asked by the mostly on-the-ball CNBC panel about his work on behalf of housing giant Freddie Mac. For the former Speaker of the House, it was a bit of a welcome-back moment; for the last few months, he’s been so much of an afterthought that moderators haven’t even bothered with his own personal history and resume.
But Gingrich had an answer ready. He denied the lobbying charge, and then, via Benjy Sarlin, offered this spirited defense:
It’s pretty self-evident, though, that Gingrich wasn’t hired as a consultant because he was an untenured history professor at North Georgia College in the late 1970s. He was hired because, as a former Speaker of the House, he had a lot of influence with a lot of imporant people. An AP investigative report from 2008 framed Gingrich’s role as that of a political operator, greasing the wheels on Capitol Hill. Key section:
Gingrich made a pretty penny as a consultant in the 2000s. As CPI reported, the former Speaker’s consulting firm took in $312,000 from the ethanol lobby in 2009. Presumably, they weren’t paying him for his historical insights.

At Saturday’s GOP presidential debate, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich signaled to tea partiers that he is one of them by making an unusual reference to Agenda 21, the international compact that conservative activists believe is a stepping stone to a United Nations takeover. It was an odd subject to bring up at a debate that focused mostly on the Middle East and Central Asia, but as it turns out, Newt’s been beating this drum for a few months now. In September, the ex-Speaker promised an Orlando tea party group that, if elected president, one of his first acts would be to sign an executive order “to cease all federal funding of any kind of activity that relates to United Nations Agenda 21”:

In that speech, he explains that he hadn’t even been aware of Agenda 21 until he’d begun campaigning and been asked about it by activists. He offered a longer explanation of his views in July, which he felt strongly enough about to post to his YouTube stream:
If you had to place money on which candidate would turn a benign pledge to promote sustainable development (one that was never even considered by the Senate) into a campaign issue, you would probably have put all of it on Rep. Michele Bachmann, who has spent much of her political career fighting against the invisible forces of the United Nations. Gingrich, though, is the only candidate to raise the threat explicitly during the campaign. So if this whole presidential thing doesn’t work out, he might consider entering the Florida Senate race.
One factor working against Gingrich, though, is that in between his departure from the House and his Presidential bid, he became an outspoken advocate for climate change legislation. Indeed, he went so far as to cut a television ad with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), calling for swift action on global warming. Acceptance of climate science doesn’t necessarily make you an instrument of Agenda 21, but many activists do see a clear link between global warming activism and the one-world conspiracy.

The most recent poll out of South Carolina, like the poll before that and the poll before that, doesn’t look very good for Michele Bachmann. She’s currently in fifth place, tied with Ron Paul, and just a few points shy of the basement. So on Tuesday, looking to give herself a little bit of momentum, she announced her new South Carolina campaign chair: State Sen. Lee Bright.
Bright’s a strong social conservative in a state where that means a lot. But he’s also got some baggage. As the Minnesota Independent‘s Jon Collins reports, he’s also got in trouble in the past for joking about secession after introducing a bill to reaffirm South Carolina’s sovereignty, telling a local paper, “If at first you don’t secede, try again.” And earlier this year, he floated a proposal to allow the state to print its own currency:
South Carolina is one of more than a dozen states that have issued similar legal-tender legislation as part of an effort to bring down the Federal Reserve from the bottom up. Bright also co-sponsored legislation to ban Islamic Shariah law from being considered in state courts.

To date, the one-liner of the 2012 presidential campaign belongs to Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who in an interview with Chris Matthews on Thursday, said of Newt Gingrich’s consulting company, “‘Frankly, I thought the ‘Gingrich Group’ were his wives.” (Gingrich has been married three times—zing!)
Frank rarely needs an excuse to pop off, and Gingrich has given him plenty in recent months. At a debate in October, for instance, the former House speaker called for Frank and former Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) to be thrown in jail for their ties to the mortgage industry, which is not the kind of charge you just casually throw out.
So, what’s at the root of the Gingrich-Frank hate-fest?
It depends on who you ask. Frank’s explanation speaks to an underlying criticism of the former Speaker: “I despise Gingrich because of the negative effect he has had on American politics.” As he told Mother Jones in 1995, he thinks Gingrich is a phony intellectual driven only by a lust for power: “That’s why he says so many wrong things: He doesn’t know a lot about substance. He half-reads some future-oriented books and out of that comes a gabble that’s not terribly coherent.” Boom.
But there’s a personal element to it as well. Frank was the only openly gay member in Congress in 1987 when, in an effort to derail the speakership of Tom Foley (D-Wash.), Gingrich aide Karen Van Brocklin leaked to reporters that Foley was gay—and that he had an affection for young boys to boot. Frank called Van Brocklin “Madame DeFarge” and added, “When people use these smarmy, smearing methods, use it as a weapon, it reinforces the idea there is something wrong with being gay.” Gingrich, in a 1995 speech in which he lamented that “Barney Frank hates me,” suggested that the animus was driven by his push to censure Frank for an ethics scandal in which Frank had put a male prostitute on the congressional payroll (you could see how that might make Frank unhappy). And in 1995, when Gingrich opposed anti-discrimination laws for LGBT workers, Frank went after him, hard: “He just had you guys in the media kidded by saying he was for toleration. By toleration he means no hitting.” Newt, he said, was “one of the most energetic homophobics” in Congress.
Frank even devotes a significant portion of his authorized 2009 biography to discussing Gingrich, and why he can’t stand him. According to Frank, Newt is “a bleeder” and “the thinnest-skinned character assassin I ever met.”
Frank is Gingrich’s natural foil—someone who is not only totally unimpressed by Gingrich’s Big-Thinker tone, but also capable of undermining it with a swift one-liner. (Frank is also gay, and proud of it, whereas Gingrich believes that “gay and secular fascism” is destroying America from within.) But there’s another aspect to it all, which isn’t likely to go away any time soon: Frank was exposed to Gingrich at his most indulgent and self-destructive, and was privy to some less-than-flattering elements of the Newt narrative.
Gingrich had been having an affair with his current wife, Callista, for six years before he finally separated from his second wife. And that dalliance was a poorly kept secret on Capitol Hill. World magazine, in a piece examining Gingrich’s personal life from an evangelical perspective, spoke with former Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Cal.) who offered this nugget:
The fact that Frank might have known about the affair all along and quietly used it as political leverage—as Dornan suggests—certainly wouldn’t have done much to cool Gingrich’s resentment of Frank. (Dornan, incidently, also hates Gingrich).
So that’s ultimately what makes Frank v. Gingrich more than just a casual flame war. Frank represents what Gingrich might call a “fundamental structural weakness” in his candidacy. Namely, that he has a 33-year track record of alienating the people works with—and they haven’t forgotten.

At Saturday’s GOP presidential forum in Iowa, newly minted frontrunner Newt Gingrich tore into the Occupy Wall Street movement, pointing to it as a symbol of exactly what’s wrong with America. “All the Occupy movement starts with the premise that we all owe them everything,” he explained. “That is a pretty good symptom of how much the left has collapsed as a moral system in this country, and why you need to reassert something as simple as saying to them, ‘Go get a job, right after you take a bath'”:

Take that, hippies! Gingrich’s zinger is part of an age-old argument on the right, which feebly insists that unemployment is actually caused by systematic laziness on the part of the unemployed rather than structural problems. Which isn’t to say OWS went entirely unrepresented at the Thanksgiving Family Forum in Des Moines. Prior to the debate, GOP moderator Frank Luntz turned the floor over briefly to an OWS protester and gave him two minutes to explain his grievances. The protester turned out to be a fairly run-of-the-mill Ron Paul supporter, and spent his time railing against the Federal Reserve. America!

As he’s climbed into contention for the GOP presidential nomination, Herman Cain has relied on a campaign staff as unlikely as the candidate himself. There’s Mark Block, the chain-smoking, mustache-sporting chief of staff who was once banned from working on elections in the state of Wisconsin. There’s Rich Lowrie, the economic adviser who devised the 9-9-9 plan while employed at a Wells Fargo in Pepper Pike, Ohio. And there’s J.D. Gordon, a former Department of Defense flack at Guantánamo Bay, who once accused a female investigative reporter of sexual harassment.
But the most curious Cain staffer is one you’ve probably never heard of. Jamie Brazil is the vice president of field operations for Cain’s campaign. He’s also godfather to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s nephew, a onetime consultant to ex-Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, and a political operative who came under FBI scrutiny during a mammoth pay-to-play scandal that roiled Philadelphia’s political world.
A long-haired attorney from Scranton, Pennsylvania, with a passing resemblance to the The Dude, Brazil built a reputation for himself in the ’90s as a political consultant adept at winning elections and making connections. A longtime friend described Brazil to the Philadelphia Daily News in 2004 as “a man who could talk a dog off a meat wagon.”
His political contacts made him a good fit in the lobbying world, and in March 1998 Brazil took a job with Commerce Capital Markets, a Philadelphia-based corporation that was just breaking into the municipal bond market. Brazil was tasked with securing contracts with Pennsylvania cities.
But there was a hitch: In his two years with Commerce, and four subsequent years in the same role at Hefren-Tillotson Inc., Brazil never obtained a license to sell municipal bonds, nor did he ever pass the required Series 52 test to work in the securities field. That’s a violation of industry standards.
In 2005, a routine inspection of Commerce Capital’s record by the National Association of Securities Dealers, the industry’s regulatory board, revealed that Brazil had been acting as an “unregistered” securities dealer. When the NASD—which is now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority—asked Brazil to provide documentation on his dealings, he refused to cooperate. As the regulatory board’s decision notes (PDF), “Throughout these proceedings, Brazil has asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination as his only defense.”
Brazil’s punishment was the most severe the regulatory board doles out to individuals. Having offered no defense or explanation for his actions, he was barred from associating with any securities firms—and docked $1,152.65 in hearing costs to boot. Brazil, who left Hefren-Tillotson in 2004, a year before the NASD rendered its verdict, has never appealed the decision.
The NASD investigation came at came at a critical moment for Brazil and his former employer, Commerce Capital. As Will Bunch has reported, both were both key players in a federal investigation into systematic pay-to-play corruption in Pennsylvania politics.
Commerce Capital had jumped into the municipal bond market with a vengeance in the late ’90s, and while Brazil was in its employ the company established itself as the dominant underwriter in the region. But its rapid ascent had raised concerns among industry observers, and ultimately, prompted a slew of state and federal investigations. As the trade publication Bond Buyer reported, from 1999 to 2003 Commerce Bancorp, an affiliate of Commerce Capital, donated $2.4 million to politicians in New Jersey and Pennsylvania—coinciding neatly with the Commerce Capital’s rise as the preeminent lender in the area.
Bond dealers are forbidden from contributing to political campaigns, but the NASD alleged that Commerce Capital had for years skirted that rule by funneling donations through Bancorp’s PAC. The company never admitted wrongdoing, but in 2005 it agreed (PDF) to a “a censure, $600,000 fine, and making a future certification to the NASD about procedures for compliance.” (The inquiry was unrelated to the Brazil investigation.)
It was around that time that Brazil’s work as a bond dealer—and the murky underworld of Philadelphia politics—came under scrutiny by the FBI, which was investigating corruption in Philadelphia’s City Hall. The feds zeroed in on key allies of the city’s Democratic mayor, John F. Street, charging that they had used municipal bonds and other city contracts for personal gain.
Among those prosecuted by the Justice Department was a Brazil associate named Shamsud-din Ali. A powerful Philadelphia imam and businessman, Ali had ties both to Street (he served on the mayor’s transition team) and the mob (his nickname was “Cutty”). Ali, the Justice Department alleged, had attempted to extort businesses seeking city contracts and bribed competitors to ensure his own businesses got a piece of the pie.
Brazil hoped Ali’s ties to high-ranking officials would open up business opportunities in Philadelphia for his then-employer Hefren-Tillotson; Ali, in turn, relied on Brazil to introduce him to new contacts. When FBI wires caught Ali meeting with the mayor of Scranton in 2001, Brazil was in the room. (The mayor was not accused of wrongdoing.) In another conversation, taped by the FBI, Brazil said to Ali, “I’d like someone to be able to say to [Street]: ‘H-T needs your help.'” (He was referring H-T Capital Markets, a Pittsburgh-based division of Hefren-Tillotson.) Brazil also served as the liaison (PDF) between Ali and Louis DeNaples, a casino owner who landed in prison for perjury over his ties to the Bufalino crime family.
Ali was ultimately convicted of racketeering, bank fraud, and extortion. Commerce Capital, following an Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, saw two high-ranking Commerce executives indicted for their involvement in the Philadelphia corruption scandal. That same year, the company announced it was exiting the municipal bond market.
Brazil’s involvement in the City Hall investigation makes him an odd choice to help lead a campaign that’s billed, at least by the candidate, as a break from traditional politics. (Cain, for his part, has ripped into the Obama administration for “crony capitalism.”) What makes his role even more unusual is that, for most of his life, Brazil has been a Democrat. And not just any Democrat—a close friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s family.
Hillary’s brothers have owned a lake house in the Scranton area for years and Brazil, who grew friendly with the Rodhams, was an early recruit for Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign. With Tony and Hugh Rodham, Brazil crisscrossed the state in a Winnebago to drum up support for Clinton, according to the Daily News. They stayed close over the years. Brazil became the godfather to Hillary’s nephew, and when the New York Senator ran for president in 2008, Brazil began helping out behind the scenes.
Angry that Clinton had lost out on the nomination to then-Sen. Barack Obama, Brazil took a paid position as the national director for Citizens for McCain, a nominally independent effort to support the Arizona senator created by Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.). Brazil hosted a dinner party at his house for Tony Rodham and McCain surrogate Carly Fiorina, along with Lynn Forester de Rothschild. They were the PUMAs, short for “Party Unity My Ass.”
Since then, Brazil has mostly worked with Republicans, although he’s stayed close enough to the Clintons. He credited Bill with connecting him with Allawi in 2010, whose party, as the Pottsville, Pennsylvania, Times-Tribune reported, Brazil helped maintain control of parliament.
Brazil, contacted through the campaign, did not respond to requests for comment. But in October, he told the Times-Tribune he had personal reasons for supporting Cain. “I like his jobs plan, I like him as a person,” he said. “This guy’s special. He’s got the X factor.”
Cain must think the same of his controversial campaign operative.

Monday’s report that Herman Cain recently ended a 13-year affair with a Georgia woman is, according to the experts, bad news for his crumbling presidential campaign. Iowa talk radio host Steve Deace, a barometer of conservative wisdom in the state, called the former National Restaurant Association lobbyist “toast.” Mike Huckabee told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren that the news would likely steer Republican voters to a candidate “with less trouble, with less controversy”—such as Newt Gingrich. Herman Cain is reportedly so concerned about the report that he is “reassessing” whether Herman Cain will stay in the race.
But there’s one question about Cain’s alleged conduct that conservative commentators aren’t asking: Is it against the law?
According to title 16, chapter 9, section 9 of the Georgia code of criminal conduct, “A married person commits the offense of adultery when he voluntarily has sexual intercourse with a person other than his spouse and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as for a misdemeanor.” At least Georgia adulterers are in good company; adultery is a criminal offense in 23 states, with punishments ranging from a $10 fine in Maryland to life imprisonment in Michigan (at least according to one judge). It’s also prohibited by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Here’s a state-by-state guide, courtesy of my colleague Tasneem Raja:


State-level adultery provisions are rarely if ever enforced, but they’re on the books for a reason; in many cases, they’ve stayed in existence due to the efforts of social-conservative activist groups and legislators. That includes folks like former Pennsylvania senator and current presidential candidate Rick Santorum. Santorum has said Americans don’t have a constitutional right to sexual freedom and, taking it step further, singled out adultery, polygamy, bestiality, and homosexuality as immoral acts that should be regulated by the federal government. In 2009, when Minnesota lawmakers sought to repeal the state’s prohibition on adultery (which, among other things, punished women more severely than men), the conservative Minnesota Family Council fought back, calling for the laws to be strengthened. (The MFC once counted Rep. Michele Bachmann as one of its education experts, and both Bachmann and Gingrich have raised money for the organization.)
In his 2010 book Fed Up!, Rick Perry takes the Supreme Court to task for its decision in Lawrence v. Texas, which struck down his state’s prohibition on homosexual conduct. (Gingrich has likewise criticized the decision.) Although it focused on gay sex, that case explored some of the same ideas behind adultery laws—the freedom of the state to prosecute consensual sexual conduct. Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), an influential social-conservative leader who hosted a candidate forum earlier this year, has argued that public schools should prohibit unmarried single mothers from teaching classes so that they don’t impress upon students their sinful lifestyle.
Maybe Cain has been telling the truth this whole time and the events of the last four weeks have really just been an elaborate conspiracy by a bipartisan coalition of five women who don’t even know each other to bring down his campaign. But the larger issue remains: Conservative lawmakers have spent years working to ensure that the state formally smiles upon some living arrangements and frowns upon others, for no reason other than to prove a point. It’s not insignificant, and it’s worth holding them to it.

As a service to our readers, every day we are delivering a classic moment from the political life of Newt Gingrich—until he either clinches the nomination or bows out.
By April 1997, House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s approval rating had dipped to 14 percent in the national polls. The balance of power in his party was beginning to shift to the now-GOP controlled Senate, and there was an ethics investigation targeting him for several allegations of wrongdoing. Rep. Peter King (R-NY) went on the record describing his speaker as “road kill.” But Gingrich was riding high, for he had just conquered Central Asia.
In advance of Mongolia’s national elections in 1996, Gingrich and Republican allies dispatched a band of consultants to groom a slate of free-market-oriented candidates. They crafted a “Contract With the Mongolian Voter,” based on the “Contract With America” Gingrich and his Republican allies composed for the 1994 election that brought him to power. The Gingrich-backed Mongolian candidates pledged to privatize 60 percent of state property, cut social services, slash taxes, and “support herders’ rights to use non-cash payment methods.” Baby steppes. As the Washington Post reported, “Even the new Mongolian election law was lifted verbatim from the election law manual of Texas.”
The election was a huge success for Gingrich. His Mongolian allies went from five votes in the legislature to 50—out of a total 76. Maureen Dowd dubbed him “Speaker of the Yurt.”
Holding up a crown-shaped hat that had been giften to him by an adoring Mongolian, Gingrich appeared on stage at the annual GOPAC conference in Washington, DC to claim victory. From that speech:
Gingrich’s overseas revolution was short-lived; the new Mongolian governing coalition collapsed four years later.

The Republican presidential field was stale and uninspiring when Gail Sheehy profiled the speaker of the House for Vanity Fair in 1995. Sheehy reported that Newt Gingrich first began eyeing the Oval Office 19 years earlier, when he was an assistant professor of history and geography at West Georgia College. “[I]gnoring the minor setback of having just lost his second campaign for Congress, he and his acolytes began to plot a presidential run scheduled for 2000 or 2004.” But Gingrich, at least publicly, wanted nothing to do with the nomination:

The Learning Channel’s “All-American Muslim,” a reality show focusing on a group of Muslim families in Dearborn, Michigan, has been a target of the Shariah panic industry ever since it started airing. On Friday, hardware retailer Lowe’s pulled their ads from the show in response to a protest campaign from the Florida Family Association.
The Washington Post published the FFA’s statement on why it objected so vehemently to the show.
These objections mirror those previously expressed by anti-Muslim activists such as Pamela Geller (she of the stealth jihad turkeys), who wrote, “All-American Muslim” is trying to show nominal Muslims as the norm, as if their existence takes away the threat from devout Muslims.” Yet the show wasn’t completely devoid of Muslim evil, as she goes on to explain:
My grandmother must also have been a “supremacist”—of the Jewish variety that is. She insisted that my mother convert to Judaism before marrying my father. Perhaps Geller can explain why, as with ritual killing of animals to comport with religious dietary laws, this is sinister when Muslims do it but not when Jews do it.
Geller’s frequent comrade-in-arms in the fight against the “Islamicization” of the United States, Robert Spencer, also weighed in, writing that “[t]he Muslims it depicts are for the most part undoubtedly harmless, completely uninterested in jihad and Islamic supremacism[.]” It’s a shame that Lowe’s would come to the conclusion that “Muslims being normal” is so controversial that it would pull its advertisements.
Anti-Muslim activists like Geller and Spencer frequently argue that they are critics of Islam but they are not anti-Muslim—that they are not motivated by bigotry. But their animosity towards “All-American Muslim,” as expressed in their own words, is motivated by the fact that it portrays Muslims as normal human beings. If Geller, Spencer, and their allies were actually concerned about Islamic extremism, and not fostering a civilizational conflict in which all Muslims are potential enemies, then this show would pose no danger to their agenda.
Their biggest fear is that shows like “All-American Muslim” will succeed at fostering the idea that Islam and American values are not necessarily in conflict. After all, if non-Muslim Americans begin to see American Muslims as being like themselves, then it becomes far more difficult to argue that Muslims’ rights should be curtailed, that Muslims should be treated with greater suspicion than other Americans, or that Muslims shouldn’t be able to build houses of worship on their own private property. It also becomes much harder to sustain a million-dollar industry devoted to persuading the country that Muslims as a whole are dangerous.
For Islamophobes, this would be more than just the end of their movement, it would be the end of their business model. No wonder they’re so frightened.

As a service to our readers, every day we are delivering a classic moment from the political life of Newt Gingrich—until he either clinches the nomination or bows out.
Newt Gingrich often says that, at heart, he’s still a four-year-old boy “who gets up every morning hoping to find a cookie that friends or relatives may have left for me somewhere.”
Thank goodness for Twitter, which has the democratizing effect of making almost all male elected officials sound like four-year-old boys bounding down the stairs in search of snickerdoodles—none more so than Newton Leroy Gingrich, whose verified account chronicled his every meal, TV appearance, and stray thought about electro-magnetic pulses and dinosaurs. (“If you have never seen dunkleostus the armored fish from the devonian you should visit cleveland museum of natural historu It is amazing”.) Or at least it did. As Vanity Fair‘s Juli Weiner noted, shortly before jumping into the presidential race in May, Gingrich quietly deleted his Twitter archive for 2009 and much of 2010.
Gingrich had an uneasy relationship with the micro-blogging platform. It was there that he’d called future Supreme Court Justice Sonio Sotomayor a “Latina woman racist” for touting her life experiences as a qualification for the bench. But he’d also given us a peek at his four-year-old side. On Easter of 2010, for instance, he live-tweeted his consumption of foil-wrapped chocolates. Fortunately, Wonkette grabbed a screenshot:

He concluded: “I like Reese’s peanut butter cup because Reese’s is also from Hershey. However Callista got me a Reese’s peanut butter egg. It is good too.”
Well, he’s easy to shop for anyway.
Update: Washingtonian has, like an 11th-century monk transcribing the works of the ancients, carefully preserved some of the early @NewtGingrich tweets. My favorite sequence:

During Sunday morning’s NBC News/Facebook debate in Concord, New Hampshire, former Republican front-runner Newt Gingrich picked a fight with a familiar boogeyman—the Environmental Protection Agency. The fact that the EPA is a prime target for the 2012 GOP field is no real surprise, but Gingrich has zeroed in on a particularly obscure subject: The EPA’s “dust regulation.”
Gingrich scored some laughs from the audience on Sunday by knocking the inanities of the EPA’s effort to regulate dust. It is “an absurdity” that a government agency should be so uptight about dust in Iowa, the former House speaker said, as he explained how the regulation would hurt the families and workers of the Hawkeye State.
This issue has been in Gingrich’s sights for some time. In Atlantic, Iowa before the state’s caucuses last week, he slammed the EPA as a “job-killing dictatorial bureaucracy” and invoked the name of one of Iowa’s top Republicans to make his case against the big-government War on Dust:
At least he’s been consistent on this. Too bad what was wrong then is still wrong now. The heart of the EPA-is-out-to-micromanage-America’s-dust hysteria is based almost entirely on a poor interpretation of language and law. The Des Moines Register  did their share of debunking on the matter, and my colleague Tim Murphy did the same:
For Gingrich, denouncing the EPA’s alleged jihad on dust and dirt might be an easy applause line, like, say, threatening to purge federal courts. But that’s really all it is.

In a tongue-in-check effort to add “some gender equity” to a mandatory ultrasound bill proposed in Virginia, state Sen. Janet Howell proposed an amendment requiring men to undergo a rectal exam and cardiac stress test before getting prescriptions for erectile dysfunction drugs. What’s good for the goose is good for the gander, right?
Well, apparently not in this case. Legislators rejected Howell’s amendment Monday by a rather slim 21 to 19 margin. The original bill, which is expected to pass the full Senate on Tuesday, requires women to have an ultrasound and be offered an opportunity to view the image—despite the fact that a routine ultrasound is not considered medically necessary for a first-trimester abortion (PDF). Explaining her amendment on the Senate floor, Howell said, “It’s only fair, that if we’re going to subject women to unnecessary procedures, and we’re going to subject doctors to having to do things that they don’t think is medically advisory, well, Mr. President, I think we should just have a little gender equity here.”
Many states have such so-called “informed consent” laws (PDF), which, as MoJo‘s Kate Sheppard has pointed out, are based on the premise that “women don’t know what’s in their uterus.” While abortion foes argue that ultrasounds are necessary to ensure that women fully grasp the consequences of their decision to abort, there’s no evidence to suggest that women don’t understand that abortion ends a pregnancy. Indeed, the Texas Tribune/New York Times recently reported on the effect of Texas’ similar new law, which was allowed to go into effect earlier this month even though its constitutionality is being challenged in court. The law has resulted in a “bureaucratic nightmare” but, according to both clinic directors and abortion opponents, it hasn’t caused a single woman to change her mind about getting an abortion.

As a service to our readers, every day we are delivering a classic moment from the political life of Newt Gingrich—until he either clinches the nomination or bows out.
Newt Gingrich has a habit of comparing himself to famous historical leaders, a tic Mitt Romney’s campaign seized on in January in a press release entitled “I think grandiose thoughts” (an actual quote from Gingrich). At various points, he’s compared himself to Ronald Reagan, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, William Wallace, Pericles, “a viking”—and, as Matt Bai reported, Moses:
This one actually makes a good deal of sense, albeit not in the way Gingrich wants us to think. Moses led his followers through the desert until they were within sight of the Land of Milk and Honey—but because of his own personal failings, never made it to the promised land.

It was sort of buried under the news of Mitt Romney’s—surprise!—blowout victory in the Illinois primary, but there was another election on Tuesday with national implications: In Illinois’ newly configured 16th congressional district, freshman Rep. Adam Kinzinger knocked off 10-term incumbent Don Manzullo by double digits to the win the GOP nomination. Manzullo was expected to retire after redistricting but ran anyway, and was opposed by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, whose Young Guns super-PAC chipped in $50,000 in radio ads. So Kinzinger’s win shouldn’t come as a total surprise.
But what’s interesting in this case is the involvement of the the Campaign for Primary Accountability, the anti-incument super-PAC I profiled earlier this month. Chaired by Texas construction magnate Leo Linbeck III, the goal of CFPA is to fund primary challenges to longtime incumbents, regardless of party. The group spent $200,000 on ads attacking Manzullo for, among other things, voting to fund the National Endowment for the Arts. CFPA has now been a factor in six House races—seven, if you count the preemptive retirement of Indiana pumpkinshooter Dan Burton (R)—and been on the winning side of three of them, knocking off Ohio GOP Rep. Jean Schmidt in addition to Manzullo and Burton. (In the other Illinois primary of note on Tuesday, CFPA-backed challenger Debbie Halvorson lost handily to Democratic Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.)
Kinzinger would have challenged Manzullo anyway, super-PAC backing or not; his alternative was to run against Jackson in a heavily Democratic district which includes Chicago’s South Side. But midway through the primary campaign, the CFPA is happy to take credit.
“We fell in all six races we’ve accomplished our purpose—we’ve increased turnout, we’ve increased participation in the primary process, and we’ve made these races more competitive,” says Curtis Ellis, the super-PAC’s spokesman. “If you look even at last Tuesday’s results [in Alabama], [GOP incumbent] Spencer Bacchus spent $1.6 million contacting voters. That’s something he hasn’t done in this century! His vote totals were 59 percent. That’s the lowest he has ever received. His challengers got 41 percent of the vote. That’s a more competitive election than that district has ever seen since Spencer Bacchus took office in 1992. Our success has never been measured in candidates being defeated. Our success is measured in how competitive these elections are. And in all cases, they’re more competitive than they’ve ever been.”
The group plans to release a new list of incumbent targets on Thursday; long-tenured congressmen from safe seats are officially on notice.

I could not argue with that: In reporting on her rise from Trump family aide to a key offic­ial at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, I’ve covered her one-month stay in public housing and her Instagram post scoffing at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Yet as I watched Patton with fascination, what I really wanted to know was this: Is the most prominent black woman in the Trump administration for real? Or is she just playing the role of the loyal black friend in a reality TV presidency?
Black conservatives like Patton, long confusing to liberals, are positively confounding in the age of Trump. Why do they stick by a president who makes openly racist statements and inspires white supremacists? But Patton insisted that she’s worked for Donald Trump and his family for a decade and truly believes that if they were racist, “one of the children would have slipped up by now.” She continued, dropping one of her many well-rehearsed lines, “I’ve said before and I’ll say it again: Trump sees things as success or failure, not color, race, gender, or creed.”
Patton’s path to Trump family insider started in New Haven, Connecticut, a place she’s said “used to be a shithole.” Her parents are Democrats; her father, an epidemiology professor at Yale, knew Ben Carson before the brain surgeon became HUD secretary. Patton graduated from Tabor Academy, a tony boarding school, in 1991; got an English degree from the University of Miami in 1996; and enrolled at Quinnipiac University School of Law but never finished. (Her official resume listed both Quinnipiac and Yale, suggesting she’d graduated from both. She later clarified that she attended summer courses at Yale.) She worked as a paralegal before joining the Eric Trump Foundation as vice president following an introduction by Michael Cohen, the president’s then-fixer, eventually becoming a Trump family senior aide in 2012. In 2015, she was named Trump’s liaison for “minority engagement.”
When I asked her when she became a Republican, Patton invoked 9/11. “It was at that moment that I realized that patri­otism was simply a punchline for Democrats. But for Republicans, it’s our lifestyle,” she told me. She voted for Obama in 2008, only to have second thoughts when he began to focus on health care reform. “I regret that vote with every fiber of my being.”
Patton first came to the public’s attention when she landed a primetime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention in July 2016. Taking the podium in a crisp white blazer, she talked about racism and black men who had been killed by police. “As a minority myself, I personally pledge to you that Donald Trump knows that your life matters, he knows that my life matters,” she said, her voice rising with conviction.
After Trump won, Patton—despite having little housing and policy experience—was appointed as HUD’s administrator for the New York and New Jersey region, home to the nation’s largest public housing agency. A front-page story in the New York Daily News misidentified her as Eric Trump’s wedding planner. When I asked her about the stubborn persistence of this dig at her qualifications, Patton shrugged it off. “The [Trump] family and I laugh about it,” she insisted.
None of this live-and-let-live attitude is evident in Patton’s outsize social media presence. Her Twitter accounts (one personal, one official) and Instagram feed are full of Trumpy indignation, lib-owning, and praise for the president. Immediately after Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide was reported, she trumpeted that he’d been “Hillary’d.” In September, the Office of Special Counsel concluded that she had violated the Hatch Act, which bans federal executive branch employees from engaging in certain partisan activities. The office reprimanded her for misusing her official Twitter account and warned her against future violations of the law.
Patton has also used her feed to recount horror stories about living in public housing run by the New York City Housing Authority and yell at its officials for their alleged failings. “The regional director is a kind of ally in seeing that the housing resources in the region are properly fed by HUD in Washington,” explains Victor Bach, the senior housing policy analyst at the Community Service Society of New York. “This is the first HUD regional director in my experience…who has been critical of NYCHA and challenging its competence.”
Much of Patton’s job involves overseeing a public housing system with enormous, long-standing problems, including NYCHA. To highlight those issues, Patton announced last November that she would spend a month living in city housing authority apartments. When she moved in early this year, some residents were skeptical—“Who the hell is Lynne Patton?” one asked a New York Daily News reporter—while others held out hope that this meant their living condi­tions would finally improve. In a clip Patton posted to Facebook Live, a woman in the Patterson Houses, in the Bronx, showed her a bathroom with a broken shower rod, peeling paint, and mold. Patton blamed the conditions on slow contractors seeking to “generate overtime money.”
Not surprisingly, the truth about the decay of New York’s public housing is a lot more complicated. Established in 1934, the city housing authority initially gave preference for subsidized apartments to middle-class white families. As it loosened its restrictions, its population grew poorer and browner. Today, 46 percent of NYCHA families have a working person in the household; more than 40 percent are supported by government benefits like Social Security and pensions. More than half of the agency’s 564,000 residents are under 21 or over 62, and the overwhelming majority are black or Latino.
Since 2000, the federal government has made drastic cuts to public housing. NYCHA currently needs $32 billion to restore its nearly 2,500 properties, some of which are more than 50 years old. While mismanagement has played a role in the agency’s woes, “the problem is not with NYCHA’s vulner­abilities, but with the lack of federal funding,” says Bach. “The situation has gotten worse since the Trump administration.” He notes that the president has repeatedly proposed terminating capital subsidies used for major repairs. During her public housing residency, Patton insisted that the HUD budget, which Trump had proposed to slash by 16 percent, wasn’t final. This was true—not because Trump had relented but because House Democrats would not approve his cuts.
In the middle of her NYCHA stay, Patton was summoned to Capitol Hill. Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and Patton’s ex-friend, was set to appear before the House Oversight committee and testify that Trump was a liar, a con man, and a racist. To dispute those claims, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) invited Patton as a character witness. She stood silently behind Meadows as he told the nation that Patton, the daughter of a man from the Deep South, said “there is no way she would work for an individual who was racist.” Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) angrily responded that “just because someone has a person of color, a black person, working for them, does not mean they aren’t racist,” and suggested that Patton was being used as “a prop.”
Afterward, Patton went on Instagram to accuse Tlaib of playing the “race card.” On Fox & Friends, Patton asserted that believing Cohen, a white man, over her, a black woman, was the real racism. When I texted Patton about the hearing, she replied: “I was never there to represent my entire race. I was there to represent one man—the President of the United States.”
Just after the hearing, the Washington Post reported that, in October 2018, Patton had asked HUD officials for legal and ethical guidance on her apparent desire to participate in a documentary series, produced by the makers of The Real Housewives of Potomac and centered on black Republicans. Unnamed HUD officials told the Post that Patton’s proposal was rejected; she said she made her own decision not to participate. She informed me that the production company had started courting her in 2016: “Therefore, the WP’s insinuation that I am attempting to parlay my attendance at the Cohen hearing or stay in public housing into an ‘audition’ was plain silly, as they had already offered me this opportunity long ago.”
Once more, her banter seemed almost scripted. If I had any doubt of that, it evaporated when she texted: “Being a black Republican is no longer an anomaly. We grow in number by the day. Not only do we suffer the same societal hurdles that face any black man or black woman, but we also have the additional albatross of being conservative.” She’d given a nearly identical line to the Post six months earlier.
True, being a black conservative is probably harder than being a black liberal. Omarosa Manigault Newman, the former Apprentice contestant who spent a year as a White House official, said she was abandoned by her friends and received death threats for supporting Trump. Yet while Patton admits that black people confront societal hurdles, white conservative ideology does not accept the idea that black people face any special challenges—at least not any that white people don’t also face. When I asked Patton how she reconciles herself to that misalignment, she texted back: “I think the majority of black conservatives simply reject the idea that ‘victimhood’ is an acceptable lifestyle.” She continued: “Not all people of color view themselves as inferior and, therefore, are not offended by the truth—such as the President’s factual comments on long-standing Baltimore distress,” referring to Trump’s tweets calling Rep. Elijah Cummings’ Baltimore district “a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess” that “no human being” would want to live in. The rant wasn’t a dog whistle; it was a bullhorn. But Patton couldn’t hear it.
“Black conservatives also refuse to subscribe to the ‘group-think’ ideology,” she continued. “We choose to vote based upon policy, not skin color. If that’s offensive to anyone, then that’s their problem, not ours.” She signed off with the shrugging emoji.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Turns Out People Got Mad,"Jacob Rosenberg,Marisa Endicott",MotherJones,"Environment
	Politics","Before impeachment, there was another big scandal. No, not that. This one involved President Donald Trump not admitting he got something a little wrong and then throwing a government agency under the bus, taking a big black marker to forge a weather map, and also rage-tweeting that he was right about an upcoming natural disaster (instead of, you know, trying to help mitigate a natural disaster).

Now, according to some emails released Thursday, we know that the whole chain of events made plenty of people mad and led to a pretty hellish few days for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
To back up: This started when Trump tweeted back in September that Hurricane Dorian would hit Alabama; it turned out it would not. A local NOAA twitter account in Alabama noted the storm was not hitting their state. (The local NOAA social media post was, according to internal emails, a clarification after an inordinate number of concerned people reached out to see if Alabama would be harmed by the storm. “It was later learned that the uptick in calls/concern regarding Alabama may have been related to a White House tweet earlier in the day,” an Alabama based meteorologist explained.) Soon after, national NOAA caved, releasing a statement saying the Twitter account in Alabama got it wrong. And that’s when Trump or someone in the White House sharpied a new “cone of uncertainty” on the map to try to cover up the president’s mistake.
After all that, NOAA eventually changed its position and said it would defend science. The director of the National Weather Service Louis Uccellini led a standing ovation for weather forecasters in Birmingham shortly after sharpie-gate and the agency released a letter saying it had “inappropriately and incorrectly contradicted the NWS [the National Weather Service] forecaster.”
And sometime after that, we FOIA’d NOAA’s emails.
We found that there were some inklings of anger at the president inside NOAA. Someone wrote in to say that the “current White House Administration has placed undue burdens on those of us in positions of life-and-death responsibility” and demanded that “[r]egardless of pressure being so unfairly, perhaps criminally, exerted, NWS needs to re-issue a public restatement of the truth.” (The bolding and italics are straight from the source—we’re talking angry emails to government agencies.) Uccellini acknowledged that the email was a “powerful statement.”
The emails also show a little towing to political concerns. There was a discussion about replying to an AP reporter looking for clarification on the forecast after Trump’s initial tweet because, as a media relations officer at NOAA wrote, “I don’t want them calling around…”—presumably to other agencies or the White House. (They settled on the following perfunctory email: “The current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama.”) In another email, NOAA officials also flatly instructed staff to “NOT respond via social media, or other, to any questions which arise from a tweet recently posted by the White House containing an old NHC forecast for Dorian.”

(Ed note: a quick pause to say “eau de trump” is hilarious and potentially a real product.)
From Beth:
Wait, Beth has more!
From Kathryn:
(Ed note: This one solicited a “these are getting very personal” message from a NOAA official.)
And, finally, NWS’ director of public affairs spells out how bad it got:
In the ensuing thread, it mentions that people in the agency “have had to turn off their cell phones due to the large volume of calls” and that this “has really gotten out of hand. One of my forecasters just messaged me and said CNN is contacting him on his personal twitter asking for comment.” The response: “Yes, I am being targeted as well. This is a difficult time.” (This email is thread is titled “Re: Angry Stakeholders”.)

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is joining the House Intelligence Committee tasked with marshaling the impeachment inquiry. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Cali.) delivered the news on Twitter, noting that Jordan would “continue fighting for fairness and truth” on what he called the “Impeachment Committee.”
On Friday, we caught a glimpse of Jordan’s line of questioning in the impeachment inquiry when former top White House National Security Council Russia adviser Fiona Hill’s deposition was released. But a day earlier, allegations that Jordan turned a blind eye to reports of abuse during his tenure as an Ohio State University wrestling coach came back to haunt him.

Jordan’s so-called pursuit of fairness in the impeachment inquiry is complicated by claims from former wrestlers that Jordan knew of and ignored complaints that the team doctor was sexually abusive for decades. The latest accusation arose from a referee who said he told Jordan and then-head coach Russ Hellickson in 1994 that OSU team doctor Richard Strauss masturbated in front of him in a shower after a wrestling match. It was documented in a lawsuit filed on Thursday by 43 former sexual abuse survivors against Ohio State—the suit is the 13th of its kind.
“Yeah, that’s Strauss,” Jordan and Hellickson allegedly said at the time, shrugging off the incident.
As NBC News reports:
The scope of Strauss’ abuse was an “open secret” at Ohio State: An independent investigation found that at least 177 former OSU athletes were sexually abused by Strauss over the course of two decades. The report revealed that Ohio State employees knew about the abuse allegations at the time but the investigation couldn’t make “conclusive determinations” about whether specific coaches knew of complaints against Strauss, who killed himself in 2005.
Ohio State officials also revealed in October that they were aware of 1,429 instances of fondling and 47 rape allegations against the abusive doctor. Eight former wrestlers have claimed that Jordan knew of the allegations but failed to intervene. That includes Dunyasha Yetts, who wrestled at Ohio State in 1993 and 1994, who claims that he told Jordan directly about a personal incident in which Strauss tried to take off Yetts’ shorts. Yetts also told NBC News that he and other teammates told Jordan about Strauss’ behavior.
Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, has repeatedly criticized Democrats for trying to impeach the president before the election and described the impeachment inquiry as an “unfair and partisan process.” He has refuted claims that he knew of and ignored Strauss’ abuse when he was at Ohio State University.
“Congressman Jordan never saw or heard of any kind of sexual abuse, and if he had he would’ve dealt with it,” a spokesperson told the Washington Post on Friday.
As the lawsuits by former athletes mount, it’s clear that the matter of who knew what during Jordan’s tenure at OSU isn’t going away.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Those attacks never had much merit—the intelligence community has a long record of whistleblowers filing complaints based on events they may not have directly witnessed—but his Republican surrogates have parroted them anyway.
This spin attempt was further discredited with Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council’s top Ukraine expert, who last month became the first participant in the phone call between Trump and Zelensky to appear before impeachment investigators. As we noted at the time, Vindman’s credentials—Iraq War veteran, Harvard graduate, respected public servant—added considerable credibility to his testimony. That included Vindman’s allegation that he was so alarmed by the July 25 phone call that he contacted a National Security Council lawyer.
But shortly after parts of his testimony emerged in news reports, Trump’s defenders wasted no time pointing to Vindman’s Ukrainian birthplace to baselessly question his American loyalties. It was a despicable smear campaign, one that the president as recently as Saturday signaled he’s committed to continuing. “You’ll be seeing very soon what comes out,” Trump told reporters when asked what evidence he had to back his recent claims that Vindman is a Never Trumper.

Let’s start with Mulvaney, Trump’s acting chief of staff. He’s on record saying that Trump explicitly linked his desire for a Ukrainian investigation of Democrats to the resumption of military aide to that country. “What you just described is a quid pro quo,” one reporter noted. “It is: Funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.”
Then there is Giuliani, who continues to insist that his work in Ukraine was “solely” in his capacity as Trump’s attorney.

The idea that Trump was unaware of Giuliani’s activities is pretty hard to reconcile with the reconstructed transcript of Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump repeatedly told Zelensky to speak over the phone with Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr about an array of topics and people Trump wanted investigated, including Joe Biden’s son. “Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man,” Trump said. “I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”
But Zelensky wasn’t the only person Trump wanted Giuliani to speak to about Ukraine. And that brings us to Sondland, who recently admitted to Congress that he told a top Ukrainian official that the country would need to publicly announce the investigations Trump was asking for in order to unlock the desperately needed aide. The Republican strategy, according to the Post, is to argue that the president never wanted Sondland to demand such a quid pro quo. (This morning, Trump tried to distance himself from Sondland, telling reporters, “I hardly know the gentleman.”)
But this defense is pretty tough to square with the facts. As my colleagues David Corn and Dan Friedman explained this week, when Sondland contacted Trump in an effort to secure a meeting between Trump and Zelensky, Trump directed Sondland to Giuliani. “He just kept saying: ‘Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy,’” Sondland told Congress. Here’s what happened next:
Giuliani, who would presumably be able to shed considerable light on what Trump was demanding, has refused to cooperate with investigators, defying a congressional subpoena for documents related to his work in Ukraine. But as Jonathan Chait notes in New York magazine, Trump himself made his desires pretty clear. In September, a reporter asked the president what he told Zelensky about the Bidens. “It’s very important to talk about corruption,” Trump responded. “If you don’t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?”

On Friday, the president went to Atlanta for the launch of Black Voices for Trump. The new grassroots coalition is an attempt by Trump’s reelection campaign to win over more black voters than he did in 2016.
Good luck with that.
Though this was supposed to be a rally to announce a new black coalition, it was a standard Trump rally. Trump took shots at Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party. He called members of the press the “fake news media.” He touted all the things he sees as accomplishments for the African American community, like a lower unemployment rate and the First Step Act, a bill that curbs mandatory minimum sentences and allows inmates to petition for quicker release but has come under its own share of criticism. He also accused immigrants of taking jobs from black people. And of course he complained about the Russia investigation and the impeachment process.
The festivities in Atlanta got started early, with black Trump supporters lined up and decked out in their Blacks for Trump tees.

The shirts were obviously a big hit! (The women behind this white couple seem just as confused as the rest of us.)

After being introduced by Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, Trump asked the crowd which term they preferred, “black” or “African American.” The crowd began chanting “Blacks for Trump! Blacks for Trump!” much to the president’s delight. He also reminded the crowd, “People forget, Abraham Lincoln was a Republican!”
It’s unclear how this will bring new black voters to his side. They care about the same things other progressive voters care about. They want climate action, anti-racist policies, and a fairer tax system. And those things are anathema to Trump.
And despite the dozens of retweets of the Trump campaign’s account from black supporters, the president is deeply unpopular in the black community. In 2016, Trump got 8 percent of the black vote. At the rally, he said African Americans were joining his side “in record numbers,” but his approval ratings among black voters hovers around the teens, depending on how far out he is from saying something racist on Twitter.
If you’ve been paying even a modicum of attention since Trump first walked onto the political stage, those low numbers aren’t surprising. Trump launched his political career by propagating the lie that Barack Obama was a secret Muslim born in Kenya. He became one of the loudest birthers demanding that Obama provide his birth certificate and school records. In 2017, after white nationalists descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, and one killed Heather Heyer after plowing his car into a crowd of protesters, Trump said that there were “very fine people” on both sides. He also reportedly referred to Haiti and African countries as “shithole countries.” In 2019 alone, Trump suggested four brown and black congresswoman “go back” to their countries, despite the fact that three of the four were born in the United States; called Baltimore, which is part of the late Elijah Cummings’ congressional district, “rat infested” after Cummings criticized the Department of Homeland Security for poor conditions in immigrant detention centers; and compared the impeachment inquiry process to lynching.
If Trump was serious about bringing new black voters into the fold, he’d have to offer them something different from his usual rants. Or maybe he’s just hoping black people will simply forget the last three years.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

On Thursday, supporters of Michael Bloomberg began laying the groundwork for a possible presidential campaign on the Democratic ticket. If he does jump into the race, it’s an open question about whether Bloomberg, who’s worth an estimated $52.4 billion, will adhere to the precedent, dating back to 1974, of presidential contenders disclosing their returns. During his 12 years as mayor of New York, Bloomberg largely resisted revealing all but the most cursory information about his personal finances.
In 2001, when he first ran for mayor, Bloomberg refused to release his IRS filings even as his rivals disclosed theirs. Asked why his competitors would release their returns but he wouldn’t, Bloomberg reportedly snarled that it was easy for other candidates who didn’t have his wealth.
“That is fine,” he told reporters. “They don’t make anything.”
As mayor, Bloomberg was slightly more forthcoming. He invited reporters to City Hall to view highly redacted versions of his tax returns that, for instance, listed his income in a range of “$500,000 or more,” instead of giving an actual figure. While that’s more tax information than what Trump has ever revealed, it does little to illuminate the extent of Bloomberg’s wealth, his sources of income, and whether he pays a fair share of taxes. Bloomberg’s mayoral press office would tell reporters the tax rate that the mayor was paying—but only the tax rate before all of his deductions were taken out, making it likely that he was actually paying much lower rates.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg defended his reluctance to publicize details of his wealth or his tax returns because it would reveal too much information about the inner workings of Bloomberg LP, the media conglomerate that he owns, to the company’s competitors. Trump, for his part, has claimed he can’t release his returns because he’s under audit, an excuse that tax experts say doesn’t hold up.
A spokesperson for Bloomberg could not be reached for comment on whether the former New York mayor will be more transparent if he runs for president. But his excuse about revealing competitive information would no longer hold up. That’s because while there is no law requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns, they disclose fairly detailed personal financial information concerning their assets, debts, and major sources of income. Much of the information is reported in ranges, but such a disclosure would likely reveal at least some of the financial secrets Bloomberg has sought to keep private.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z
https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/a-german-princess-a-cardinal-and-an-anti-lgbt-activist-walk-into-the-supreme-court/,2019-11-08,,,politics,"November 8, 2019","A German Princess, a Cardinal, and an Anti-LGBT Activist Walk Into the Supreme Court…",Stephanie Mencimer,MotherJones,Politics,"Last week, two of the Supreme Court’s most ardent Catholic justices, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, met at the court with an odd trio of visitors: Brian S. Brown, who runs several anti-gay advocacy groups; German Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, once known as a 1980s party girl; and Gerhard Ludwig Müller, a right-wing German cardinal who has said publicly that a “homosexual network” inside the church is responsible for the clergy sexual abuse scandals.

While the trio may have a vested interest in the court’s LGBT-rights jurisprudence—one of Brown’s groups has filed an amicus brief in cases currently pending before the court—their visit is notable for another, unexpected, reason: All three are in the vanguard of a political, right-wing movement that’s been pushing to topple Pope Francis. By posing for a photo op, the powerful Catholic justices provided an all but official expression of support for their work.
“It is striking that these Catholic justices met with some of the most vocal and vociferous of all the Holy Father’s opponents,” says Father James Martin, an American Jesuit priest who has supported better treatment of LGBT people in the church and who Pope Francis appointed as a consultant to the Vatican’s communications arm. “I wonder if this were, say, 20 years ago, whether they would have posed with people who had accused St. John Paul II of heresy and implied that his papacy was illegitimate—and smiled while doing so.”
Since his election in 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the first Latin American pope, has moved to reform the church in ways not seen since Pope John XXIII abolished the Latin Mass and freed nuns from wearing their hair-concealing habits in the 1960s. He has supported allowing some divorced people to take communion and pushed for greater tolerance of LGBT people. But he has also used his powerful platform to preach progressive Catholic social teaching, condemning the death penalty and imploring the world to fight climate change.
Francis has been particularly outspoken in his support for immigrants, telling a group of German pilgrims visiting the Vatican in late 2016, “It’s hypocrisy to call yourself a Christian and chase away a refugee.” He has celebrated mass on the Mexican border and suggested that President Donald Trump is not Christian because of his anti-immigrant policies. Perhaps most importantly, Francis has taken direct aim inequality, global capitalism, and the evils of growing nationalism in Europe and elsewhere. In doing so, the 82-year-old Jesuit has sparked a powerful backlash, particularly among right-wing clerics, wealthy conservatives, and anti-gay activists.
Brian Brown has been at the apex of the Francis resistance efforts in the US, turf he marked out as one of the country’s foremost anti-gay activists. He’s the co-founder and president of the National Organization for Marriage, an anti-LGBT advocacy group created in 2007 to push Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage. NOM has never disclosed its funders, but the leading suspects have been the Catholic Knights of Columbus and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was active in the Prop 8 fight. NOM has been the leading opponent of same-sex marriage in the US, and has also defended the discredited “ex-gay” conversion therapy, opposed legal protections for transgender people and kids, and promoted anti-gay adoption laws.
Since losing the battle decisively in 2015, when the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriages in all 50 states, Brown has taken his culture war abroad through the International Organization for the Family (IOF), another group he founded to push anti-gay legislation in places with authoritarian governments, like Russia and Hungary. A devout Catholic with nine children, the 45-year-old Brown seems to have had mixed feelings about Francis. In the past, he has credited the progressive pope for sticking with church teaching about traditional marriage. But Brown also runs a conservative political action committee called ActRight, which in a September Facebook post suggested that the “socialist, environmentalist” pope was a gay man himself.

Brown was apparently responsible for bringing Müller to DC and the Supreme Court. His IOF co-sponsored an event at the Willard Hotel where Müller spoke about his new book, a thinly-veiled critique of the reforms in the church under Pope Francis. Müller is an ally of the former Pope Benedict and previously served as the church’s top orthodoxy watchdog—until Pope Francis sacked him in 2017. Müller has been an outspoken critic of the church under Francis, particularly the pope’s recent move to allow some married priests to serve in the Amazon. He’s part of a right-wing group of cardinals who have suggested that a gay mafia is operating inside the Vatican, and that “homosexuals” are singularly responsible for the church’s ongoing clergy sexual abuse scandals.
Joining Müller on his Washington tour was Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, a former ‘80s punk rock party girl (dubbed Princess TNT by Vanity Fair) who has become an uber-conservative Catholic and a close personal friend of the former Pope Benedict, who took the unusual step of stepping down in 2013. According to the New York Times, Princess Gloria’s castle in Regensburg, Germany, has served as something of a salon for disgruntled right-wing Catholic elites and cardinals like Müller who are unhappy with Francis. Last year, she was working with former Breitbart News publisher and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, a vociferous Francis critic, to create a “Gladiator School” at her castle to prepare conservative Catholics to fight to preserve traditional church practices and to train an army of far-right activists in nationalist ideology. The princess introduced Bannon to Müller, according to the Times.
The Supreme Court wasn’t the only seat of power the cardinal and the princess visited with Brown in Washington. Brown described shepherding the pair around DC on the IOF website, writing, “This past week, I had the distinct honor of accompanying Cardinal Müller and Princess Gloria at a number of important meetings in Washington. Certainly a major highlight of our meetings was the opportunity to spend time with Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh.” He reported having several meetings with “high-level officials in the White House” and meeting with members of Congress, including Rep. Greg Pence (R-Ind.), the vice president’s brother.
The Supreme Court press office did not respond to an inquiry about how the anti-Francis crowd scored a private audience with the justices. But it wouldn’t be the first time a conservative Catholic on the court has publicly fraternized with right-wing Catholic activists. Both Alito and Kavanaugh have close ties to Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the conservative judicial group the Federalist Society. Leo has been instrumental in pushing Trump’s judicial nominations, including Kavanaugh’s, who is, in turn, the keynote speaker at this year’s Federalist Society national lawyers’ convention in DC. Alito has also been an occasional speaker at the group’s events.
Leo has had a long history of involvement with right-wing Catholic organizations. For instance, he serves on the board of the Catholic Information Center in Washington, an outpost of the secretive and powerful Opus Dei (which means “work of God” in Latin), a 91-year-old organization known as the church’s “Holy mafia,” which seeks to promote far-right politics and oppose any signs of creeping liberalism. They continue to celebrate the Latin Mass, in defiance of the work of Pope John XXIII. (The author Dan Brown highlighted Opus Dei members’ practice of mortification of the flesh in his book, The Da Vinci Code.) Membership to Opus Dei is closely guarded, but the late Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia was long rumored to have been a part of the organization. The DC center is the meeting place of ultra-conservative Catholics seeking power in the nation’s capital. Both Attorney General William Barr and Trump White House Counsel Pat Cipollone are former board members.
Justice Alito has also publicly rubbed shoulders with other high-profile conservative Catholics who are viewed as Francis opponents. In 2017, John Gehring, Catholic program director at the nonprofit think tank Faith in Public Life, attended a $1,250-per person, two-day conference of American Catholic elites at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. The event was sponsored by the Napa Institute, a Catholic nonprofit founded by billionaire Timothy Busch, a lawyer who made his fortune in estate planning for the 1 percent. In 2011, Busch co-founded the Napa Institute to train Catholics to defend their faith in an increasingly secular society, and last year, launched the Napa Legal Institute to provide legal services for Catholic nonprofits. The Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo is on its board. Even so, Gehring was surprised to find Alito in the audience for Busch’s kick-off speech back in 2017. Busch has been a big player in what Tom Roberts, executive editor of the National Catholic Reporter, describes as the “hostile takeover” of the US Catholic church by right-wing billionaires.
Busch—along with the oil and gas magnate Koch brothers—has given millions of dollars to the Catholic University of America to teach libertarian economics focused on aggressive individualism and reduced government aid to the poor, ideas squarely at odds with much traditional Catholic social teaching. He also sits on the board of the Eternal World Television Network, a media empire that has become something of a Catholic Fox News and a prominent forum for attacks on the progressive pope. (Cardinal Müller did an interview with the network while he was in DC last month, and Raymond Arroyo, a pro-Trump, anti-Francis EWTN host, was the master of ceremonies at his book event.) Busch’s Napa Institute holds annual conferences that feature powerful political figures—Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) had top billing at one this summer—and are hotbeds of anti-Francis activism and right-wing politics.
“It’s part of this ecosystem where well-funded conservative Catholics have been very effective in making inroads with influential politicians and legal scholars,” Gehring says, “and apparently Supreme Court justices, too,”
But federal judges, including those serving on the Supreme Court, are supposed to remain above the fray, even religious ones. The judicial cannon of ethics says judges must not use the prestige their office to advance private interests, their own or of others. The justices’ photo op with Brown, Müller, and the princess all but signals their approval of efforts to undermine the progressive pope.
The photo op was bad for the court for more secular reasons as well. Brown’s NOM has filed amicus briefs in three LGBT-rights cases the justices will decide. The cases will determine whether the Civil Rights Act protects LGBT people from being fired from their jobs based on sexual orientation. Take Back the Court, a liberal group advocating to expand the number of justices on the court to break up its conservative majority, has written letters to Alito and Kavanaugh asking them to recuse themselves from the three cases in which NOM has filed briefs. “The credibility and impartiality of the current Supreme Court is in tatters,” the group’s executive director Aaron Belkin said in his letter. “Posing for photographs with the president of an advocacy organization that has filed briefs in matters pending before the court makes a mockery of Chief Justice Roberts’ assertion that a judge’s role is to impartially call balls and strikes.”
Still, it’s unlikely the justices will recuse themselves from the term’s hottest cases. The only people who can enforce legal ethics rules for Supreme Court justices are the justices themselves, and they rarely deem any of their members guilty of a conflict of interest. Justice Clarence Thomas, for instance, heard challenges to the Affordable Care Act even though his wife was working with conservative groups devoted to overturning the law.
Charles Geyh, a judicial ethics expert at the Indiana University law school, says the justices are bound by a federal statute that requires them to disqualify themselves in cases where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. But even then, their bar is pretty high. He recalls the time in 2004 when the late Justice Antonin Scalia spent a weekend duck hunting with Dick Cheney when the court was considering a case in which the sitting vice president was a named defendant. Scalia still participated in the case, arguing that Cheney had no personal stake in its outcome and that as a result, no one could question his impartiality.
Alito and Kavanaugh apparently met with Brown for far less time than Scalia spent with Cheney in the duck blind, however, and Brown’s group is only an amicus, not a full party in the LGBT cases. “While it would be a gross ethical violation if they discussed the case in their meeting, there is no indication that happened,” Geyh says of Brown and the justices. Nonetheless, he says, “The optics are not great. Meeting behind closed doors with an amicus in a pending case raises concerns that could be avoided if the justices kept their distance from parties, their lawyers, and amici, while the case was pending. But it’s a stretch to argue that a relatively brief exchange between amicus on topics unrelated to the action creates a perception of partiality problematic enough to require disqualification.”
But really, it’s not like anyone ever believed the Catholic conservative justices were going to do anything other than side with groups like NOM against LGBT people in the cases currently before them, regardless of their photo op with the anti-gay activist. Alito voted against same-sex marriage legalization in 2015, and Trump would never have nominated Kavanaugh if he’d shown even the slightest sympathy for the victims of anti-gay discrimination. What the visit may mean for the embattled Pope Francis, however, is another question.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Health officials tested lung fluid from 29 people who fell ill after vaping—and detected vitamin E acetate in all samples. The findings are a major step forward in the investigation into the mysterious lung illness that has so far killed 39 people and sickened more than 2,000 people in the US.
“This is the first time,” the CDC’s press release reads, “that we have detected a potential chemical of concern in biologic samples from patients with these lung injuries.”
Vitamin E, which is found in dietary supplements, cosmetics, and foods like meat, fruit, and vegetables, is typically safe to ingest or apply to the skin, the CDC says. But it may not be safe to inhale. Vitamin E acetate is also a new additive, found mostly in illicit cannabis products, according to marijuana news site Leafly.
Still, it’s still not totally clear whether products containing THC (the psychoactive molecule found in cannabis) or nicotine are to blame, though the results indicate the former: In the 29 lung fluid samples tested by health officials, THC was identified in 82 percent of them; 62 percent of the samples contained nicotine. Most patients reported a history of using THC vaping products, according to the CDC. As I wrote in September, these results reinforce early findings made by state health officials about vitamin E acetate.
In light of this discovery, it’s worth noting that we don’t know much about the long-term impacts of vaping:
The CDC recommends that people continue to steer clear of vaping products that contain THC and refrain from buying “any type of e-cigarette” off the street.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

As he notes, Hill’s testimony is significant because it depicts acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as central to the administration’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Trump’s domestic political enemies. Hill testified that Rudy Giuliani, who is Trump’s lawyer, was helping Russian disinformation efforts by spreading the debunked (but Trump-favored) conspiracy theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 US election. She also told lawmakers that Giuliani and his now-indicted business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, mounted a campaign to oust US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch to advance their own business interests—and that she suspected Giuliani might have been involved in criminal activity. And Hill described how she has become the target of conspiracy theories that have led to death threats. More from David:

The proximate cause is simple: Eurozone growth is tepid and inflation is subdued, which has caused the European Central Bank to set its policy rate low as a way of stimulating the economy. The current interest rate is -0.5 percent, and once you account for inflation it’s even lower.
This has a different impact in different countries. In Germany, for example, government bond yields are literally negative. In Greece, which is not as economically stable, yields are positive, but only barely: Greek bonds still pay less than US treasurys.
I was cogitating on this the other day and wondering how this could be. The ECB can set interest rates wherever it wants, but it does no good unless people are willing to buy eurozone bonds with low or negative yields. Why, I wondered, would investors accept a lower yield on the Greek bond than on US treasurys? And why are they willing to accept the even lower yields on the bonds of other eurozone governments? It was all above my pay grade, so I googled to get an expert view. Here is Ashoka Mody:
This made me feel better. Even Mody is confused. He offers up a couple of possible reasons for this state of affairs, but concludes that they make no sense. In the end, the question stands. Why would anyone in their right mind accept a lower yield on a Greek bond than a US bond? Or even a German bond, for that matter? Treasurys are the strongest, safest investments around, and the US economy is in better shape than pretty much any European economy.
So: why does anyone buy Greek bonds? Why isn’t there a huge stampede at every auction of Treasurys? Can anyone point me to a nice, simple explainer on this topic?",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Seven Mountains Dominion Theology, for the uninitiated, posits that Christians have an obligation to fill the ranks of government and other key areas—mountains—of life ahead of the second coming. Bachmann’s relationship with Porter isn’t as deep as Huckabee’s (who called her a “prophetic voice”). But it does underscore a problem she’ll face as she looks to establish her credibility with mainstream Republicans: Bachmann has made it in politics by forging alliances with folks whose ideologies make her own conspiratorial views and anti-gay positions seem downright pedestrian.

The former Godfather’s pizza godfather put his foot in his mouth early in his campaign when he told Think Progress he wouldn’t appoint any Muslims in his administration (which would be unconstitutional), and again when he said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) wasn’t loyal to the Constitution because he’s Muslim, and again when he said he has never encountered an American Muslim who is loyal to the Constitution, and then again when he denied ever saying any of those things and blamed the media.
Now he’s given up on walking back his statements and returned to his roots. On Thursday, Cain made a campaign stop in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the Nashville satelite that’s become a ground zero for the anti-Islam jihad. At the center of the controversy is the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro, a local mosque that has been trying to expand its facilities. Opponents have alleged that the the mosque is secretly waging a (very, very) stealth jihad against the people of Middle Tennessee. The construction site has been subjected to arson, and the project itself was challenged in court by opponents who argued that Islam is not a religion and therefore is not entitled to First Amendment protections (The Justice Department said otherwise). Cain, evidently, agrees with the Murfreesboro anti-mosque activists:
Cain decided very early in his campaign that to have any sort of impact, he needed to stake out a position on the far right. But now, as Politico notes, he’s now gone so far to the right he’s gone back in time to August, 2010, when the number-one threat to the country was the construction of a mosque in downtown Manhattan.

Lost amid the last-second push to pass the “sugar-coated satan sandwich” that is the debt ceiling deal, Eli Lake has an interesting piece over at The New Republic exploring the Republican party’s collapsing foreign policy consensus. The good news? The cocky, rigid neoconservatism that defined the last decade is less influential now. But that doesn’t mean it’s being replaced by anything more, well, sane. Here’s Lake:
Gaffney, for the unfamiliar, is a former Ronald Reagan Pentagon official who has become one of the leaders of the right-wing anti-Islam crusade. Team B II was an ad hoc group formed by his Center for Security Policy which last year produced report, Shariah: The Threat to America, on the existential threat posed by radical jihadis in the United States government.
Gaffney has warned that CIA Director David Petraeus is a slave to Islamic Shariah law; that President Obama’s missile defense logo represents a concession to radical Islam (it was actually produced by the Bush administration); and that “there is mounting evidence that the president not only identifies with Muslims, but actually may still be one himself.” In 2008, he also argued that “there is evidence Mr. Obama was born in Kenya.” Gaffney believes that high-ranking members of the Obama foreign policy team are secretly working for the Muslim Brotherhood, and, last fall, he alleged that Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist was in cahoots with radical Islamists as well—which, in turn, meant that the entire Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) had been compromised.
This all makes Gaffney sound conspiratorial, but that’s kind of the point: His big foreign policy idea, which he’s presumably counseling Bachmann on, is that is that there is a comprehensive plot by Islamic extremists to infiltrate the United States government and all other levels of society and destroy America as we know it. But then again, considering Bachmann once attended a conference dedicated to framing Middle Eastern politics in the context of End Times prophecy, Gaffney might be a step up.

No.
Perhaps I should backtrack. Last month, GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain publicly apologized for a number of anti-Islam statements he had made on the campaign trail. After calling on authorities to block the expansion of an Islamic community center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee; warning that Muslims were attempting to force a radical strain of Islamic Sharia law on unsuspecting Americans; and pledging not to appoint any Muslims to his cabinet, the former pizza mogul’s longshot run for the White House had hit a serious rut. So he met with Muslim leaders in Northern Virginia to smooth things out. It didn’t change that fact that Cain was getting his ideas on Islam from debunked conspiracy theories, but he at least seemed to have reached the conclusion that Muslims don’t bite.
But now the authors of those conspiracy theories are none too pleased. Frank Gaffney, a Washington Times columnist and anti-Sharia activist who once warned that President Obama was raised a Muslim and might still be one, told Think Progress that Cain might be in league with the Muslim Brotherhood:
Bryan Fischer, the American Family Association issues director who has called for a moratorium on mosque construction in the United States, is also frustrated with Cain’s new dance. “Cain had said that any community which does not want a jihadist-spouting mosque in its community shouldn’t be forced to have one,” he wrote. “And of course, he was right about that, and it’s unfortunate that he has retracted the statement. His bobbing and weaving on Islam is leaving his supporters a bit dazed and is hurting his candidacy.”
This comes just one weeks after the anti-immigration group Numbers USA gave Cain a “C-“ on its candidate report card—despite the fact that he had previously promised to build a giant moat along the entire US–Mexican border, filled with alligators.

Even Michele Bachmann’s former chief strategist thinks Michele Bachmann went off the deep end on vaccines. On Monday, and then again on Tuesday, the Minnesota congresswoman and GOP presidential candidate repeated baseless claims that the HPV vaccine mandated by Texas Governor Rick Perry can cause mental retardation in adolescent girls. Her comments met swift rebuttals not just from pediatricians, but from conservative talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. And now you can add Ed Rollins, the long-time GOP strategist who is currently serving as a senior adviser role to the Bachmann campaign.
Via Politico:
Like his candidate, Rollins has a history of going off-message. Before he took a job with Bachmann, he told CNN that she was not a “serious candidate.” In his first interview after joining the campaign, he boasted that he and his staff would fact-check everything Bachmann says to prevent her from going off the rails. Rollins stepped down from his post as chief strategist in early September for health reasons, but is still involved with the campaign in an advisory role.

For months, Rep. Michele Bachmann has been conspicuously silent on the rash of teen suicides in her suburban Twin Cities congressional district. (The situation in the Anoka-Hennepin School District has gotten so bad that state public health officials have officially designated it a “suicide contagion area.”) Activists have claimed the school district’s “no promo homo” policy, which prohibits teachers from saying positive things about homosexuality, abetts anti-gay bullying in the area. Another possible factor in the epidemic is the activism of groups like the Bachmann-supported Minnesota Family Council, which has stated that gay teens who commit suicide bring it upon themselves “because they’ve embraced an unhealthy sexual identity and lifestyle.”
Now Bachmann’s finally weighed in—sort of. Over the weekend, Bachmann was in Californa for a series of fundraisers, a campaign rally, and an appearance on Jay Leno. At a stop in Costa Mesa, she was asked what she would do about the bullying contagion in her district. Her response? “That’s not a federal issue.” And then she moved on. The Minnesota Independent notes that last week, activists brought a petition with 100,000 signatures to Bachmann’s district office.
The problem with Bachmann’s position is that, whether or not it’s a federal issue, she’s already made it a Michele Bachmann issue. In May, she keynoted a fundraiser for the Minnesota Family Council, which at the time was lobbying hard against any bulling legislation in the state legislature. And as a state senator, she fought anti-bullying legislation, asking her colleagues, “Will it get to the point where we are completely stifling free speech and expression? Will it mean that what form of behavior will there be, will we be expecting boys to be girls?”

GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain was having a pretty good week. On Tuesday, three polls from Public Policy showed the businessman/gospel singer in the lead in North Carolina, Nebraska, and West Virginia. Another recent poll had Cain trailing only Mitt Romney in the key Florida primary. Then, on Wednesday, he put his foot squarely in his mouth in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Here’s what Cain said when asked about the #OccupyWallStreet movement:
Cain added that the banks “did have something to do with the crisis in 2008, but we’re not in 2008, we’re in 2011! Okay?”

To put it bluntly: Cain really doesn’t have any facts to back him up. The protests were initially organized by Adbusters, which is hardly an organ of the Obama administration. As my colleague Andy Kroll reported this morning, organized labor has made a push to get behind the movement, but they’re piggybacking on a movement that has already taken off.
This is not the first time Cain has found himself on the wrong side of facts. Citing debunked conspiracy theorists, he alleged that Islamic Sharia law was already being forced on American courts in Oklahoma and Texas (he meant Florida), and despite touting himself as a constitutionalist, argued that the First Amendment does not apply to the Muslims of Murfreesboro, Tennessee. (Cain has since apologized, and then denied that he changed his position.)
Cain’s not the only Republican candidate to weigh in on the #OccupyWallStreet: On Tuesday, Mitt Romney called the protests “dangerous” and “class warfare.”

Federal authorities have arrested a 22-year-old soldier from Kentucky on unspecified charges of espionage. Spc. William Colton Millay, a military police officer, was picked up in late October on his base in Alaska, Reuters reports. The arrest conjures up memories of another young soldier, Pfc. Bradley Manning, who’s spent years in custody accused of passing a trove of classified documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to WikiLeaks. Thus far, the Army and the FBI insist that Millay’s case is unrelated to those leaks. “This has nothing to do with WikiLeaks,” an FBI spokesman told an Anchorage, Alaska, newspaper. That report also reveals that Millay’s unit, the 164th Military Police Company, recently embarked on a difficult war deployment:
The accompanying photo shows soldiers from Millay’s unit training in Alaska for their deployment to Afghanistan back in January. An Army spokesman made it clear to Reuters that Millay had not joined the company downrange, though: “He was part of the rear detachment,” the spokesman said. “I don’t know why in his particular case he was part of that (rear deployment) but that’s not unusual.”
Nevertheless, Millay’s arrest could be related to information he had access to regarding that deployment. Mother Jones is investigating the case and will provide updates as they come.
UPDATE 1: Army Times interviews with friends of Millay’s from his Owensboro, Ky., hometown, deepen the mystery surrounding his charges and possible motivation:
UPDATE 2: Millay’s unit, the 164th Military Police Company, is currently in the middle of a deployment at Forward Operating Base Mehtar Lam, a modest outpost in the restive East Central Afghanistan region. The tour’s taken its toll: Rod Nordland of the New York Times last June wrote a riveting profile of some of the unit’s women, which detailed the gripping attacks and fatalities the company has sustained.
YouTube has a video, shown below, of the 164th’s soldiers preparing last winter for their Afghanistan deployment; Millay does not appear in it. But one soldier, Spc. Timothy Moon, said on the video that the company members knew each other inside out: “We’ve been an organic team for quite a while so we know each other we don’t have to really talk too much when it comes to getting ready for a mission, ’cause we know what each other’s jobs are and what’s gonna get done.”

This is a video of the 164th’s Afghanistan base both from the air and on the ground, taken a few years back. Mother Jones is investigating whether Millay’s knowledge of unit operations there may be related to the allegations against him:

GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain has a Muslim problem. Cain has already publicly suggested that Muslims are not guaranteed First Amendment rights and that he would not hire any observant Muslims in his hypothetical administration. His strategy, as with most of his other problems, has been to deny having said any of the things he has said, and then, when pressed, to insist that he’s answered the question already, end of story, period. But Cain appears to have shot himself in the foot once again. Chris Moody attended Cain’s event at the Holy Land Experience in Orlando, a Biblical amusement park, and reports that Cain started his speech off with a curious anecdote:
This isn’t the first time Cain has discussed his fears of Dr. Abdallah. It was a stripped-down version of this same anecdote, told during an interview with CBN’s David Brody, that first sparked interest in Cain’s anti-Muslim views in February. That Cain’s still beating the drum seven months later tells you a good deal about the seriousness and discipline of his campaign; it also says a lot about Herman Cain. (My colleague Adam Serwer, meanwhile, can fill you in on why, if you’re looking for villiains in the Lebanese Civil War, there’s plenty of blame to go around.)

Martin Luther’s acolytes had the printing press. The Velvet Revolution had rock-and-roll radio stations. The Arab Spring had Facebook. Michele Bachmann’s long-shot quest for a second American Revolution has Foursquare. Well, it’s something anyway.
Bachmann won’t win the Republican nomination, but her campaign is on the upswing in Iowa, where the latest Public Policy poll has her breaking double digits for the first time in months. Last week, she kicked off a 99-county bus tour, to visit every corner of the state, and she seems to think she might actually have an outside shot at winning the caucuses. The days when she had to yell frantically at debate moderators to get a little face time have passed, at least for now. What’s her secret? It’s the world’s most perplexing social media platform this side of Ping.
There she was, at the Thirsty Dog in Manly on Sunday evening. Four minutes earlier, if Foursquare can be trusted (and I would suggest to you that it must, it simply must) she was at the Prime and Wine in Mason City. That followed a stop at Shooterz Bar in Forest City (try the meatloaf), and successive appearances at Pizza Ranch franchises in Garner and Clarion. She started the day by checking in at Harvest Baptist Church in Fort Dodge (with two others). On Saturday, it was much of the same: Pizza Hut in Ida Grove (where she unlocked the “Bender” badge for checking in for the fourth consecutive night)—and three more Pizza Ranches, in Rockwell City, Pocahontas, and Emmetsburg.
Oh, and the compulsory visit to Cronk’s in Denison, where this happened:
She held off on tweeting about it, at least. On Friday she as at Hey, Good Cookies in Spirit Lake, Cool Beans coffee shop in Estherville, and—noticing a trend here—Pizza Ranch in Sibley.
So what does this all mean? Michele Bachmann goes to a lot of pizza places: In Garner, she unlocked the Level 2 Pizzaiolo badge; as I’m writing this, she’s just checked into the Princess Grill and Pizzeria in Iowa Falls, and she’ll have stops later on Monday at Pizza Ranches in Charles City and Waverly. But there’s a method to all of it. As Kerry Howley reported in March, Pizza Ranch holds a unique place in Iowa politics. When Mike Huckabee won the caucuses in 2008, he did it by hitting all 69 franchises in the state. Social conservative activist Bob Vander Plaats (of marriage pledge fame) has used the buffet-style chain as a staging ground for his own campaigns. It’s a way of microtargeting the predominantly old, predominantly evangelical voters who will decide the results on January 3.
Of course, the senior citizens who hang out at Pizza Ranch to listen to Michele Bachmann talk about Alfred Kinsey are also, generally speaking, not the sort to unlock the oversharing badge on Foursquare. Which just goes to show you that while candidates have more social media tools at their disposal than ever before, they’re still not entirely sure what to do with them. That is, unless Bachmann becomes Mayor of the Iowa caucuses.

[Update 5:45 PM PST, May 22, 2012: Thomas Massie, the candidate supported by John Ramsey’s super-PAC, has won the GOP nomination in Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District.]
John Ramsey is not the only college student with his own super-PAC. Since last summer, dozens of projects have sprung up on campuses across the country, most of them with names—Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Yesterday; Penn Staters for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow—that pay homage to their inspiration, Comedy Central’s Stephen Colbert.
But Ramsey, a 21-year-old economics major at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas, is almost certainly the only college student in the country to build his own super-PAC from scratch, seed it with $890,000 he inherited from his grandfather, and use it to tip the scales of an otherwise anonymous Republican primary 900 miles away from his home.
Since last Thursday, Ramsey’s outfit, Liberty for All, has been running television ads in Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District in support of Thomas Massie, a Ron Paul-endorsed candidate who’s running to fill the seat of retiring GOP Rep. Geoff Davis. With one week to go until the election, Massie leads in the polls and, in a deep-red district, stands a better-than-average chance at winning in November, too. But Ramsey isn’t leaving anything to chance. His PAC has poured $542,600—almost all of it from his own pocket—into campaign ads. And unlike most outside groups, Liberty for All is putting hundreds of thousands of dollars into a ground game, too—splurging on direct mail and organizing get-out-the-vote and phone-banking operations.
It’s no small accomplishment for someone who’s still nine credit hours away from his bachelor’s degree.
Ramsey incorporated Liberty for All in March, along with Preston Bates, a onetime Democratic state committeeman from Louisville who, like Ramsey, had decided to put off graduation indefinitely to focus on politics. The two met while working on Ron Paul’s presidential campaign in Iowa and saw an opportunity. There are dozens of political action committees across the country dedicated to supporting Ron Paul—Ramsey gave $550 to one of them, Revolution PAC, last fall—but their emphasis on grassroots organizing meant that they were inherently myopic. The idea for Liberty for All, as they envisioned it, was to put together an organization that could think big.
“We’re the only freedom organization that is focused on winning elections, plural,” Bates says. “They were focused on winning one election and that’s Ron Paul’s campaign. Our [goal] is to become an institution.” They’re hoping to create nonprofit spinoffs devoted to voter education and candidate development. That would give the “Liberty movement”—the term of choice for Paul’s brand of libertarian-infused conservatism—the kind of infrastructure it currently lacks. “I don’t know of frankly any super-PAC that’s doing that,” Bates says. “I would call us more like a party, frankly.” He points to groups like the Democratic National Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee as models.
The other major difference between Liberty for All and various other Paul-inspired PACs, though, is that Liberty for All has money. When Ramsey’s grandfather passed away in 2010, John and his two siblings became millionaires overnight, inheriting holdings in real estate, timber, natural gas and other industries in separate accounts. Ramsey won’t say how much he has left in the bank, but he’ll open up his checkbook again if necessary.
“I think John’s position is to develop the PAC and to spend what it takes to get the PAC professionally managed and off the ground,” Bates says. “We don’t feel like we’re even comparable to other maniacal Crossroads GPS-style fear-and-smear super-PACs,” Bates says, noting that the group is placing an emphasis on small donors going forward. The goal is to be self-reliant by the summer and ultimately raise $10 million.
But first, there was the matter of finding a race where Bates and Ramsey could pursue what they call their “humanitarian” political rescue mission. Through Bates’ Kentucky activist network, they settled on Massie, an MIT-trained engineer turned anti-tax activist running in a state where Rand Paul, Ron’s son, cruised to victory in an open-seat Senate race two years ago. Massie’s race in many respects parallels Rand Paul’s 2010 campaign, pitting the Republican establishment against the younger, more tech-savvy Liberty crew. His most serious rival, state Sen. Alecia Webb-Edgington, has picked up endorsements from the retiring Rep. Davis and ex-Sen. Jim Bunning, another former 4th District congressman. The Susan B. Anthony List, the conservative answer to EMILY’s List, is backing her with a small ad buy.
For the moment, Liberty for All’s main battleground is Kentucky, where it has 11 paid staffers. But that stands to change. In Texas, Liberty for All has four local chapters and nine full-time employees devoted to supporting Ron Paul, working phone banks, and training delegates ahead of the state’s May 29th Republican primary. In light of Paul’s decision to stop spending money on upcoming primary contests, the group will be the closest thing the congressman has to an organized get-out-the-vote operation. Ramsey says he’s more than happy to pick up the slack.
“We’re on the frontier of freedom; we’re defending the American way of life,” he says. “We want to take the front lines, we want to be the front-line PAC that takes the weight of the freedom movement on our shoulder.”
The group is also going after Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who’s become a pariah among internet activists for his sponsorship of the Stop Online Piracy Act, which they fear will effectively censor the web. Along with Test PAC (the first political action committee of, for, and by the Reddit community), Liberty for All has joined a coalition of PACs and super-PACs which have pledged to take down Smith.
Massie’s opponents have responded by shaming Liberty for All as little more than the impulse buy of a wet-behind-the-ears carpetbagger. “You may have heard about this college student from Texas that’s shown up here and is trying to buy this election by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of his own money to advance his libertarian ideology and score a win for the Ron Paul movement,” Webb-Edgington told a GOP gathering in Kenton County last week. “It’s a shame that this young man’s gonna waste so much of his family’s hard-earned money. Because here in Kentucky we’re gonna stand united as Kentuckians and we’re gonna send him back to Texas empty-handed.”
As for Massie, he told the moderator at a debate on Monday that he’s never met John Ramsey. But, he added, “I think he’ll probably be getting a Christmas card from me this year.”

Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.)—last seen in these parts warning that undocumented immigrants would vote en masse for Obama this fall—suggested at a fundraiser last weekend that President Barack Obama might not have been born in the United States. It was awkward:
This comes just one month after another GOP freshman, Missouri Rep. Vicky Hartzler, expressed her own doubts about the President’s place of birth.
Okay, so birthers are still a thing, and will probably always be a thing; cut the head off a conspiracy theory and it sprouts eight more. (There are still people who maintain that Zachary Taylor ate poisoned cherries!) But here’s the problem for Coffman: As David Nir notes, Coffman’s not running in the same district that elected him in 2010:
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has listed Coffman’s seat as a “Red to Blue” pickup, meaning it’s going to be a top battleground in the fall. Running a birther campaign and smearing Latinos—a rapidly growing demographic in the Mountain West—might not be the best strategy if he wants to keep his job.

It was a fitting culmination to “Vaginagate“—the scandal that’s brought national attention to an anti-abortion bill passed by the Michigan House last week.
Here’s the backstory: Last Wednesday, during debate on a slew of anti-abortion provisions, Democratic state Rep. Lisa Brown was reprimanded by the Republican Majority Floor Leader for violating the decorum of the House and banned from speaking the next day. Her offense? After saying that the legislation would go against her Jewish religious beliefs and that abortions should be allowed when required to save the life of the mother, Brown ended with, “Finally, Mr. Speaker, I’m flattered that you’re all so interested in my vagina, but ‘no’ means ‘no.'”
Another Democrat, Rep. Barb Byrum, was also silenced when she proposed an amendment that would apply the same regulations required by the bill to vasectomies as well—which, as MoJo has reported, is a popular new tactic by cheeky state lawmakers who support abortion rights.
House GOP spokesman Ari Adler eventually claimed that the kerfuffle “has nothing to do with the word vagina.” Instead, Brown was deemed out of order for implicitly comparing the legislation to rape by saying “no means no.”
But by that point, there was no walking back the social-media friendly scandal. Abortion-rights supporters were all too happy to capitalize on the symbolism of banning a woman lawmaker for talking about female anatomy while speaking against a bill related to reproductive health. (“Can’t say it? Don’t legislate it,” advised the ACLU of Michigan.) And nothing invites ridicule like male lawmakers who seem squeamish about discussing lady parts. (Just ask Virginia state Rep. Dave Albo.) Plus, the word “vagina” makes for some popular Twitter hashtags.
And you’ve gotta love the signs. Here’s a short video, courtesy of the Michigan House Democrats, featuring some of the best ones from Monday night’s event—which was, rather aptly, dubbed political theater by the bill’s supporters.

In mid-May, Texas Republican congressional candidate Wes Riddle posted a new note on his Facebook page. It was written by his spokesman, Garrett Smith, and it was dire. “The reasoning for President Obama’s impeachment,” Smith wrote, “begins with the fact that the State Department is giving away seven strategic, resource-laden Alaskan islands to Russia.” According to the statement, Riddle—who has Rep. Ron Paul’s endorsement and stands a good chance of winning in November if he can make it out of next Tuesday’s runoff—believed that Obama’s unprecedented giveaway included at least one island the size of Rhode Island and Delaware combined, “billions of barrels of oil” from offshore deposits, and unknown strategic advantages.
“The agreement was negotiated in total secrecy, not allowing the state of Alaska to participate in the negotiations, and…the public was not given any opportunity to comment,” he wrote.
There were a few problems with this indictment of Obama: The president hadn’t given away any islands; the treaty in question had been signed by President George H.W. Bush in 1991; none of the islands, which are well on the other side of the international boundary, had ever been officially claimed by the United States; and Alaska’s two US senators at the time had publicly endorsed the measure. Smith’s rant, much of which was copied word for word from a WorldNetDaily article, was based on a falsehood.
Riddle, an Army veteran turned West Point instructor turned historic-theater owner, isn’t merely another commenter on the internet. He could be coming to Washington. A few days after this Facebook post on the Alaskan islands, he pulled in 15 percent of the vote in a crowded GOP primary for Texas’ 25th Congressional District, a solidly red splotch of central Texas that went to John McCain by 10 points in 2008. That was good enough to vault Riddle into next Tuesday’s runoff election. Riddle will take on Republican Roger Williams, a former Texas secretary of state who now owns a car dealership (more on that later) and a donkey ranch. The winner will almost certainly be the district’s next congressman. 2010 may have been the year of the tea party, but Riddle’s candidacy, backed by Paul and local activists, is a sign it’s not going away.
In addition to the Alaska island giveaway, Riddle has called for Obama to be impeached for signing the National Defense Authorization Act and for appointing Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau when Congress was on recess. “President Obama stated publicly that he would not allow a handful of Republicans to stop him from doing what he desires,” Riddle wrote of the Cordray appointment. “That ‘handful’ of Republicans are the elected representatives of the people, empowered by the Constitution to approve or deny appointments to high offices.”
On his personal blog, Horse Sense, Riddle muses on a range of subjects, from the importance of Flag Day to the value of entrepreneurship. In April, he penned an 800-word op-ed on the supremacy of Western civilization, noting, “Western civilization has produced the height of all civilizations in certain respects, to include literature. As Saul Bellow pointed out a few years ago, there ain’t a Tolstoy of the Zulus or a Proust amongst the Papuans.”
Western civilization wasn’t perfect, Riddle explained, but it was better than the alternative. “I don’t want America to be a microcosm of the world, if by that you would include all the ignorance, ugliness, vice and corruption that are present in the world—chiefly (though not exclusively) from non-Western imports.” Besides, he noted, even our worst moves had unintended benefits. “Slavery in America was clearly harmful and wrong to the people who lived under it, but it proved to be the unintended transmission belt that brought Africans into the orbit of Western freedom,” he wrote. “Are the descendants of slaves really worse off? Would Jesse Jackson be better off living in Uganda? Would we? (Don’t answer that).”
Riddle’s source for the Alaska conspiracy theory appears to have been a February op-ed in the birther site WorldNetDaily by former Alaska Senate candidate Joe Miller. The Facebook note either paraphrases or copies verbatim large portions of Miller’s piece (which FactCheck.org rated “simply false“). “The seven endangered islands to be given away in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea include one the size of Rhode Island and Delaware combined,” thunders Riddle’s note. “The seven endangered islands to be given away in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea include one the size of Rhode Island and Delaware combined,” thunders Miller.
If anything, though, Riddle’s out-there views have only endeared him to tea partiers. In early July, Riddle picked up a big endorsement from Paul, the Texas congressman whose two presidential campaigns have produced an army of libertarian-minded activists. “Liberty voters have a strong choice in this CD-25 Republican runoff,” Paul said in a statement. “I hope my generous supporters will help Wes win this runoff because we need more men like him.” Like Paul, Riddle’s criticized public programs like Social Security and food stamps, and holds an outsized view of the powers delegated to the states under the 10th Amendment.
Still, Williams isn’t conceding much ground. The Austin American-Statesman reported in July that he was sending out direct mail fliers blasting Obama’s 2009 economic stimulus for, among other things, subsidizing “pancakes for yuppies” in Washington, DC—a reference to the recently opened Columbia Heights IHOP. (The Statesman affirmed that Columbia Heights is full of yuppies, but it noted that the money had been invested through a community economic development grant and created full-time 70 jobs.) Williams’ first campaign ad featured him lecturing a herd of donkeys from his ranch about conservative values while reading from a copy of his pocket Constitution.
In response, Riddle has attacked Williams as a phony conservative for publicly opposing the auto bailout while privately profiting from it. As Riddle noted, Williams’ wife, Patty, traveled to Washington to lobby on behalf of their car dealership.
Riddle’s biggest asset isn’t Paul; it’s the calendar. As the Texas Tribune‘s Ross Ramsey noted, turnout for midsummer runoffs tends to be abysmal. Usually about half the number of people who show up for the primary turn out for the final vote—which would mean about 5 percent of eligible voters in this case. So Riddle only needs about 19,000 votes to clinch the nomination and all but assure a trip to Congress. Runoffs tend to favor candidates with high levels of support from political activists. Riddle, who founded the Central Texas Tea Party, fits the bill.
For Riddle, the stakes couldn’t be greater. In February, Riddle, who asserts that states have the authority to nullify federal laws they consider to be unconstitutional, posted an item on Horse Sense warning that Americans’ freedoms were being snuffed out in the name of well-meaning reforms like child labor laws, and no one was willing to do anything about it. “I JUST WISH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LEAVE US ALONE,” he wrote, bursting into all-caps. But he feared Americans had grown too complacent. “[I]s another Robert E. Lee or Jeff Davis left anywhere in this unified, chained and tethered house of ours—locked down from the inside out?,” he wondered. “Is there a governor with backbone anywhere in the country to point out and even put an end to…(shall I name it? Are you willing to recognize it?). Tyranny.”
Come next January, he might just be a congressman.

What is Pussy Riot?
Pussy Riot is a Russian, anti-Putin, riot grrrl art collective. The group formed in September 2011, directly after Vladimir Putin announced his run for president (again). The 10 performers are known for dressing up in balaclavas (knitted ski masks with eye and mouth holes cut out) and staging punk-infused protest art shows in Moscow’s public spaces.
On February 21, five members of Pussy Riot performed a “punk prayer” at the altar of Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow. The original cathedral was destroyed by Stalin in 1931 and rebuilt as a godless celebration of the state (later becoming the world’s largest swimming pool), but it returned to its function as an Orthodox church in 1994. Pussy Riot stood under the cathedral’s elaborate frescoes, punched at the air and cursed, pleading with the Virgin Mary to kick Putin out of power. Watch the video here.
What happened after that?
Two weeks after being led out by cathedral security, three members of Pussy Riot were arrested with a warrant for “hooliganism,” a charge for which they could serve up to seven years. They were denied bail, and their trial was repeatedly postponed. Two of the women are mothers of young children, and all three have remained imprisoned for nearly five months.
On Monday, the trial finally began. The defense had little time to pore over 2,800 pages of an indictment, and tweets from Violetta Volkova, one of the defense lawyers, tell of the women being given five consecutive days, from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m., to read their charges in a cage-like cell at court.  Today, the defense claimed that after 11 hours in court yesterday deprived of food or sleep, the women were too exhausted to proceed. According to the Moscow Times, Judge Marina Syrova eventually promised to let the defendants take a break.
A demonstration in Dresden, Germany, April 2012 Solidarity Action in Dresden/Freepussyriot.orgSounds like people are angry. Who?
Well, the Russian Orthodox Church, for starters. Patriarch Kirill, the Russian Orthodox religious leader, has said that the church is “under attack by persecutors,” and spokesman Vsevolod Chaplin announced that Pussy Riot’s sin “will be punished in this life and the next.” Chaplin is also asking the women to repent. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has shrugged off the notion that the treatment of Pussy Riot has been unnecessarily harsh. “In some countries the responsibility for such actions would have been much more strict,” Medvedev told the UK’s Times last week.
The case has folks peeved all over the globe: A symbol of artistic struggle against political repression, the band’s treatment has sparked grassroots protests from Helsinki to Mexico City. (Check out the slideshow.) FreePussyRiot.org, the support organization started soon after the arrest, has spread to at least six countries, and helps coordinate actions and benefit shows. As the result of a mysterious DDoS attack last month, FreePussyRiot.org has set up proxy websites to keep the updates flowing. Musicians, artists, anarchists, feminists, and advocates of free expression continue to take up the balaclava in protest.
Is that why Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers wore a Pussy Riot T-shirt at the band’s show in Moscow?*
Yes. Peter Gabriel has also written a letter of support, and British actor, author, director, and comedian Stephen Fry has taken up the fight through his Twitter account. According to Pussy Riot lawyer Mark Feygin, the Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis has also spoken to Madonna and texted Bono about the cause.
Okay…but what if celebrities texting other celebrities doesn’t work?
Those protests mentioned above aren’t going away any time soon, and high-profile pressure outside the country and within is mounting. Last week, Amnesty International hosted a protest outside the Russian embassy in Washington, DC, and in Moscow, one anti-Putin/pro-Pussy Riot rally’s numbers swelled to 1,500. Supporters are planning another protest during the trial, tentatively set for August 11 and 12. Meanwhile, artists like Stuart Semple and musicians like Finnish jazz pianist Iiro Rantala have announced they will not show their work or perform in Moscow on Pussy Riot’s behalf, and another supporter even held a hunger strike for 25 days.
Members of the Independent Social Ecological Movement in Brno, Czech Republic, decorated city statues in balaclavas in June.  Nesehnuti/Freepussyriot.orgWhere’s Putin in all of this?
Defense lawyer Mark Feygin submitted to the court a list of 34 witnesses he’d have liked to call on, including Kirill and Putin. The court rejected it. But while Putin may be lying low, there’s no doubt that the Kremlin’s crackdown on Pussy Riot has hit a nerve with both the Russian public and abroad. Tens of thousands of Russians, including celebrities and the pious, have signed a petition asking the government to release the women. Not exactly a good look for the president.  (See the update below.)
So, what’s going to happen to Pussy Riot?
The women are pleading not guilty, and the trial will last until mid-August, according to Rob Lieber, a representative from FreePussyRiot.org. In the meantime, the outcome remains unclear. (There’s also this unhelpful poll, which suggests US asylum and an appearance on Oprah as potential fates for the prisoners.)
How can I follow the trial?

Update (Thursday August 2 2:00 PM PST): On Thursday, after weeks of escalating public pressure, Vladimir Putin announced to Russian news agencies that he doesn’t think Pussy Riot “should be judged so harshly for this,” Reuters reports. “I hope the court will come out with the right decision, a well-founded one,” the Russian president added. This is an auspicious sign for the defense, which now expects a “softening of the prosecution’s position” as a result.
Update (Thursday August 2 6:30 PM PST): The Russian Legal Information Agency, coordinated by the Russian judicial system and the state news agency, has been publishing live updates from the trial in English. The beginning of Thursday’s report reads like fiction: First, the court was cleared out for an hour and a half because of an anonymous bomb threat to the court; the three defendants, though, weren’t evacuated. After proceedings resumed, a group of Hare Krishnas and Pussy Riot supporters stood outside the court, chanting with tambourines.
Then, a panel of experts diagnosed all three defendants with personality disorders based on their “activist” stances, “desire for self-realization,” “overstated self-esteem,” and tendency to voice their opinions. That same panel of experts conceded, however, that the women’s actions and lyrics show no signs of animosity towards any group or religion. Today, FreePussyRiot.org also published the prison writings of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, which echoed the sentiment: “The prosecution accuses us of hiding our true motives (which supposedly are religious hatred and enmity) to avoid punishment,” she wrote. “But we do not hate anyone.”
UK Foreign Office Minister and Parliament member Kerry McCarthy is expected to observe the trial in person next week. A photo of Patti Smith’s Oslo show this week is also now making rounds online, showing the godmother of punk herself with a T-shirt that reads, “Putin has pissed himself.” Tomorrow, there are rumors that leading anti-Putin activist Sergei Udaltsov could appear at court, and lawyers are expecting a verdict sooner than they had originally predicted—perhaps by early next week.
Update (Friday August 3 1:30 PM PST): Tensions erupted on day five of the trial. A journalist was removed from the court for laughing, and the judge stopped multiple defense witnesses, including Yaroslav Nikitenko, a founder of FreePussyRiot.org, and famed activist Alexei Navalny from testifying. (Navalny, who was named one of Time‘s most influential people this year, is the nation’s leading Livejournal muckraker—in the next few years, he anticipates a popular revolt in Russia to match the Arab Spring.)
When Nikitenko and other defense witnesses tried to enter the courtroom to testify on behalf of the women, a bailiff stopped them. The witnesses were asked to arrive by noon, but at 5 p.m. they were still waiting. According to Nikitenko, who spoke to Mother Jones today, the judge ordered that the witnesses be blocked from the courtroom. Nikitenko then tried to take a picture of the bailiff with his phone, but the officer slapped it out of his hand, sending the battery pack flying. Nikitenko was pushed down the steps and away from the building. Today, only three out of 16 defense witnesses were allowed into the court to testify.
All eyewitnesses to the “punk prayer” proposed by the defense, Nikitenko adds, were prohibited from testifying—while the prosecution’s witnesses were permitted. “We see that they just want to make this fake justice, not real justice,” Nikitenko said. “We have no justice.”
Like the day before, a crowd of Pussy Riot supporters gathered outside the court. Three masked men who stood on the ledge of a building across the street shouting, “Free Pussy Riot!” were eventually removed by mechanical crane.
Update (Monday August 6 4:30 PM PST): It’s coming down to the wire: Pussy Riot is set to hear the verdict this week, according to Reuters and defense lawyer Violetta Volkova.
In the meantime, and after much speculation, Madonna has made a statement on the trial. “I’m against censorship, so I hope that the judge is lenient with them and that they are freed soon,” she said. The Russian Orthodox Church, on the other hand, has pegged the country’s moral future on Pussy Riot’s actions. “The moral conscience of our people and future of the country depend on its outcome,” church spokesperson Vsevolod Chaplin said on Friday.
And, in keeping with procedure from last week, this week Judge Syrova continued to reject the defense’s efforts to call witnesses to the stand. Today, she refused the defense’s request to question Igor Ponkin, the “expert” whose opinions served as the basis for the charges of vulgarity against Pussy Riot. (Fun fact on Ponkin’s expertise: In 2008, he co-authored a bill that tried to regulate Russia’s emo teenagers.) RAPSI, the Russian Legal Information Agency, has also stopped publishing live updates of trial coverage, but today British parliament member and trial observer Kerry McCarthy was there to take up the torch. “Women brought to court at 8am, 2 hours before start, and with long journey from prison. They say they’re getting 2-3 hours sleep,” she tweeted.
Even with the deadline approaching, Peaches, electronic musician of “Fuck the Pain Away” fame, has announced she’ll be recording a song for Pussy Riot tomorrow, and is asking for help with the music video. “Please send a 30 second video of yourself showing support by dancing, jumping on your bed, breaking shit, laughing, holding a free pussy riot sign etc.,” she wrote in a post on the Riot Grrrl Berlin Facebook page.
Update (Tuesday August 7 4:30 PM PST): With verdict and sentencing expected in the coming days, today Pussy Riot prosecutors asked that the women receive three years in prison as punishment. One attorney representing an alleged victim of Pussy Riot’s punk prayer, however, suggested that the women be sentenced to two years of probation instead. In addition, another attorney asked that Judge Syrova mandate universities to take action against future “hooliganism” from students.
The Guardian‘s Miriam Elder reported that defense attorney Mark Feygin made an impassioned speech in court, telling journalists, the judge, and witnesses that Pussy Riot’s verdict could “tear up relations between society and government.” He’s not the only one to come to this conclusion: Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the subject of another high-profile, politically-charged Russian trial, published an op-ed in the Guardian on Monday, arguing that the state is “profaning Russia with its utter lack of conscience.”
Madonna, too, is praying for the women’s freedom, as she told the packed crowd at her Moscow show today. She also donned a balaclava during the performance and printed the words “Pussy Riot” on her back.
Update (Wednesday August 8 11:30 AM PST): After a week and a half of debates, protests, witnesses being refused entry into the courtroom, a bomb threat, and bolstered international support (see Yoko Ono; Madonna), Wednesday’s proceedings saw moving final arguments from the three Pussy Riot prisoners themselves. Tolokonnikova quoted the likes of Solzhenitsyn and Dostoyevsky, while Alyokhina told the court, “No one will take my inner freedom away.” Each speech ended in applause, much to the apparent chagrin of Judge Syrova, who informed the crowd that the court was not a theater. Pussy Riot’s verdict will be delivered the afternoon of August 17.
Update (Thursday August 16 6:30 PM PST): If the Kremlin and Judge Syrova were hoping international interest in Pussy Riot would die down with the hiatus between closing arguments and a verdict, those hopes have likely been crushed.
On Saturday, the mayor of Reykjavik sported a balaclava during the city’s Gay Pride parade, and French and German lawmakers echoed concerns regarding Pussy Riot’s sentencing last week. On Tuesday, Amnesty International delivered more than 70,000 petitions to the doorstep of the Russian embassy in Washington DC, only to have Russian officials dump those petitions on the sidewalk. Paul McCartney, The Who’s Pete Townshend, Bjork, and Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker have also voiced support of the imprisoned women, and pro-Pussy Riot rallies in more than two dozen international cities are mobilizing for marches on Friday. This week, literary magazine n+1 published Pussy Riot’s closing arguments in English, and tonight electro-punk feminist musician JD Samson (Le Tigre, MEN) hosted a reading of them in New York City, featuring Chloe Sevigny, performance artist Karen Finley, and poet Eileen Myles, among others.
Before the trial’s closing arguments, Kathleen Hanna (formerly of Bikini Kill) argued for a global Pussy Riot movement. “Who knows this could be the start of a whole new thing,” Hanna wrote on her site. “A whole new motivating source for a globally connected unapologetic punk feminist art and music scene.”
Judge Syrova is to read the verdict at 3 p.m. in Moscow tomorrow.
Update (Friday August 17 4:50 AM PST): It appears Judge Syrova has found Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Yekaterina Samutsevich, and Maria Alekhina guilty of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred, and their lawyers have tweeted as much from the courtroom, but a formal declaration has yet to be made. Those in the packed room are standing, waiting for the sentence. According to multiple accounts from journalists outside and inside the court, a number of crowd arrests have been made, including former World Chess Champion Garry Kosporov. Judge Syrova is rereading details of the girls’ charges and testimonies, and has accused the women of homosexual propaganda, as well as a premeditated crime (as evidenced by their face masks).
Update (Friday August 17 7:05 AM PST): After a lengthy rereading of the Pussy Riot charges and testimonies that took three hours, Judge Syrova sentenced each of the Pussy Riot members to two years in prison. After the verdict was delivered, cries of “shame” could be heard throughout the courtroom.
Update (Friday August 17 10:25 AM PST): Protesting this morning’s guilty verdict and sentencing, six people were arrested in a New York City march down Fifth Avenue. Two arrests were made at 10 a.m. EDT, and four more followed in the next 45 minutes, according to the National Lawyers Guild. More marches in Chicago and San Francisco are planned throughout the afternoon, but in the meantime, the scene in Times Square looks something like this.
Update (Friday August 17 1:15 PM PST): The U.S. State Department has issued a statement on Pussy Riot’s behalf: “The United States is concerned about both the verdict and the disproportionate sentences handed down by a Moscow court in the case against the members of the band Pussy Riot and the negative impact on freedom of expression in Russia,” it reads. “We urge Russian authorities to review this case and ensure that the right to freedom of expression is upheld.”

If You’re Homeless, It’s Nearly Impossible.","Nathalie Baptiste,Will Peischel",MotherJones,Politics,"Arlington Street People’s Assistance Network or A-Span is a one-stop shop, offering shelter, meals, and medical services to people who are homeless in Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, DC. The center is unobtrusive, located  on the second floor of an office building in the midst of Arlington’s sprawling municipal center. With its bright yellow lobby, clean waiting room furniture, and potted plants, this could be a dentist’s office, minus the coffee table of expired magazines. By noon, a crowd arrives—as if by appointment—and files into the cafeteria for lunch, to consume just one of the 38,000 meals the center will provide this year. On Tuesday, when, residents of Virginia went to the polls for an off-year election to determine who would control the state legislature, no one at the A-SPAN homeless center was wearing an “I Voted” sticker.
Virginia has some of the strictest voting laws in the nation, a strategy the now-defeated Republican legislators had enacted to keep the state’s political map red. Some of those who have been most affected by those laws are the state’s homeless people, many of whom are already unlikely to vote. Sometimes, voter ID laws get in the way. Sometimes, the correct polling station is inaccessible. Not having a fixed address makes the problems multiply. With a population of 8.5 million and 5.6 million registered voters, there are 5,975 people experiencing homelessness in Virginia—.07 percent of the population.
At any given moment, more than a half a million Americans are on the streets or in designated shelters like the one in Arlington, because they don’t have a place to live. Thanks to an increasingly tight housing market and the decimation of the social safety net, homelessness remains at crisis levels. The federal government began recording the number of homeless people in 2007, when there were 647,258 unsheltered people nationwide. Since then, homelessness had been trending downward but then spiked by 0.3 percent between 2017 and 2018, due to a decline in the number of individuals living in emergency shelters and transitional housing.
Recently, the country’s homeless population has become a point of reference for politicians. In September, President Donald Trump said that the record number of homeless people in Los Angeles and San Francisco “hurt the prestige” of California. Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro has pledged to end chronic homelessness by 2028. But the national conversation rarely focuses on the homeless as potential voters, even as several federal court cases have solidified their right to vote. But taking a look at what took place during Virginia’s election, illustrates some of the problems that homeless voters are likely to face throughout the country in 2020.
Joe Simmons, whose stocky frame dominates the plastic chair he sits on, is one of the approximately 215 homeless people in Arlington County. He is 49-years old and has been at the center for two weeks following his release from a few months in the county jail for having violated a court order tied to a pair of 2006 felony charges. Simmons says he’d accumulated more than 300 court-instructed community service hours—required as part of his probation—but a filing error prevented those records from reaching the judge, who sent him to jail. After he was released, he returned to the storage unit where he kept all of this possessions. They had all been thrown out.
The incident was disheartening, but not unfamiliar. In 2014, Simmons served time in Arlington for breaking probation tied to the same charges. After his release, he discovered his landlord had deposited everything he owned on the curb. “Back to square one,” he says in a quiet monotone. During his most recent time in jail, some representatives from Offender Aid and Restoration, a Virginia-based restorative justice organization, spoke to him about voting. “Voting would be something new to me because I’ve never done it,” he says. “A person who’s done it numerous times, it’s natural to them. So, I have to research and see what it is I have to do to be able to obtain the rights back.”
Felons are banned from voting in Virginia, but Governor Ralph Northam has provisionally used his executive power to restore those rights to released felons, a trend started in 2016 by his predecessor, Terry McAuliffe.  On probation and recently-released, Simmons isn’t sure what his status is, but he appreciates the consequences of casting a ballot. “One vote could tip the balance of who becomes the next senator, the next president, the next sheriff,” he says. “An extra vote counts.”
After we spoke, Mark Magness, who became homeless only the day before after a surprise rent hike unfolded into eviction, walked up to chat. Before he lost his home, his financial situation was sustainable, if fragile. An injury kept him from work long enough to be fired, but he had enough money to get by—until his housing costs doubled. Magness’ polling place is located across the county from A-SPAN, so he can’t afford to get there. This will be the first election in which he has not voted since 1988, when he was 18. “You’re supposed to,” he says. “People fought and died for it. Why am I just going to blow it off? And it makes you more aware of your community.” He regrets not being able to vote in this election but acknowledged some relief that it was not a more important one. “It’s too bad,” he says. “But it’s not the big one. It’s not for senate or governor or president. I can let this one go.” By the next election, Magness plans to be in a stable residence, back in his voting district across the county.
Magness may not see these off-year elections as significant, but advocates point out how the homeless are affected by the decisions of those who are in office in sometimes surprising ways. Everything from new zoning laws to criminalizing loitering can affect where homeless people live and sleep. “They’re a part of the process and their voices should be heard,” Annie Leomporra, a civil rights fellow at the National Coalition for the Homeless, says. “People in this space are dehumanized on a daily basis. One way to bring them back to human status is engaging them in voting.”
And one way to do that is by voter registration drives at homeless shelters. In the months before November’s elections, Spread the Vote*, an organization that takes people to the polls and helps them get government-issued IDs, made regular visits to the A-SPAN homeless shelter. The centralized nature of a homeless shelter may offer voter advocacy groups a place to reach that population, but the high turnover rates bring additional challenges. “Our clients change,” says David Ordonez, the director of shelter programs at A-SPAN. “It could be different individuals one week, and another group another week. They move around so much. When the winter comes, it changes; when the summer comes, it changes.”
Registration, obviously, is only the first step. Today, 35 states require some sort of identification to vote, and Virginia is one of seven states known for having strict voter ID laws. In a 2018 Northern Illinois University study that ranked each state by how easy it is to vote, Virginia came in second to last, only beating Mississippi. In 2013, the state introduced a voter identification law. In order to cast a ballot, Virginians have to provide a valid photo ID, which includes a driver’s license or a passport. Without one, residents only can cast a provisional ballot until they provide proof of identification within three days, or the ballot is not valid.
For a homeless person, maintaining the necessary documents to either acquire a valid ID or use as one is not always easy, especially when they often lose important documents in city-enforced sweeps of their camps. “If you’re not present [during a sweep], they’ll throw away your stuff,” Leomporra explains. “Including your birth certificate and your social security card. And it can take a year to get it back.” Virginia actually offers a voter ID card that’s technically free, but even so, the logistics of acquiring one can involve travel to a different location, that may require funds that aren’t available.
Add that to the fact that the challenges homeless people regularly encounter—hunger, lack of shelter, inadequate clothing—can make civic participation less of a priority. Terrance Toussaint, the programs director at A-SPAN, says convincing people at the shelter to register and vote under those circumstances makes for a tough sell. When addressing groups, he makes voting relevant by tying it to their daily needs. “Hey,” he says. “This is your right in this country, to vote. If you do, you’re helping yourself with the services that you need.” He explains that one strategy is “to point things out to them that they’re getting now, that they’re benefiting from now. The fact that you’re even in this building is because someone took that opportunity to say, ‘You need this.’ And you do that by voting.”
After more than a decade of working with various populations at A-SPAN, Toussaint knows not to expect anything more than a cautious response. But if he can get a few people willing to go to the polls, he knows he’s made his mark. “The hope is to get maybe two or three in the group to understand,” Toussaint says. “One person gets the information, and it spreads like wildfire. The conversation continues with those people to the rest of the population.”
Sometimes, that information can infect an entire facility. Randy Moore, the director of policy and advocacy for the Virginia Housing Alliance, remembers when he ran a voter registration drive at a homeless shelter. “It was the largest line of people checking their [voter] status,” he recalls. At many shelters nationwide, registering to vote is part of the intake process. But shelters are notoriously not stable housing. Not everyone remains there for reasons of safety or space.
“We went out to our local parks to see if anyone wanted to register,” Leomporra, says about her work in Washington, DC, with its large homeless population of 6,521. “It can be hit or miss, but it’s an effective approach.” But even if the people they reach out to aren’t receptive to registration, just getting the word out about voting rights can help. “It’s also an education,” she explains. “They can talk to a friend about it and hopefully that collectivism will perpetuate people to vote.”
Ordonez recalls a years’ long effort to get Jerry, one of his clients, a photo ID card. They had a good relationship, but Jerry, a bearded veteran who’d served in Iraq, was infamous for his uncanny ability to disappear. “I would see him on the street and try to get a hold of him for those two minutes of talking to him,” he says. “I would turn around, he’s gone.” After two years of those interaction, Ordonez delivered the ID. “The first thing he said to me: ‘Hey Dave I want to tell you something. I feel like I’m a human again just getting this,'” Ordonez recalls. “A lot of them get mistreated out there.’”
Even if a homeless person has managed to obtain an ID card and register to vote, just getting to the polls can be the final obstacle. “Transportation is often the biggest barrier,” Moore says about voting in Virginia. Polling stations are determined by the place of registration, so homeless people, who tend to be more transient, often struggle to return to wherever they first registered. Many cities in Virginia have limited, or expensive public transportation, and polling stations are often difficult to find. Advocates have tried to fill the gap by offering some transportation service from homeless shelters on voting day, but there is always a problem when trying to find a way to bring voters with extremely limited resources to the polls.
“Part of dealing with homelessness is making people feel like they’re part of a community,” Steve Berg, the vice president of programs and policy at the National Alliance to End Homelessness says. “And being a voter and making decisions about elected officials is part of of belonging to a community.”

It seems likely that transmission equipment from the utility, which supplies power for roughly 40 percent of Californians, sparked the recent Kincade fire, a blaze that pushed over 180,000 people from their homes in and near Sonoma County, destroyed 374 structures, and burned almost 78,000 acres. As many as 16 fires burned across the state over the past several weeks, and at the same time PG&E was intermittently cutting power to millions of people—a practice the company’s CEO predicts will continue for another decade. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency and hasn’t been shy about calling out the company for it’s mismanagement and incompetence.
This has put PG&E, which filed for bankruptcy in January over its role in other recent wildfires, in the crosshairs of just about everyone—customers and legislators, as well as the governor—and state officials are looking desperately for a savior to rescue the crumbling grid and the flailing utility.
But right now, it’s really difficult to foresee what the future holds for PG&E—and more broadly for energy across California. Newsom has hinted the government, if it’s not satisfied with the pace of bankruptcy proceedings, could step in and try to take control of PG&E, but he also recently called on Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway to make a bid for the company. (Berkshire Hathaway’s energy subsidiary is deeply invested in utility companies and renewables in California and several other states.) The governor has also been open to the idea of municipalities taking over their own power management, which some of the cities themselves have echoed. At the same time, in ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, PG&E’s shareholders are fighting its bondholders, who’ve formed an alliance with fire victims, for control.
I recently called up John Geesman, an energy consultant and attorney who served as the executive director of the California Energy Commission, the state’s primary energy policy and planning agency, to try to figure out what is going on and who would even want to take on this mess. We talked about the different stakeholders involved, who might end up in charge of local power, and what the maneuverings will mean for the utility’s millions of customers. “This is a case of first impression,” he says. “The future is going to have to be invented here and invented pretty quickly.”
When we spoke last week, Geesman’s home had been without power since the weekend before, so he was staying up in the Sierras where electricity, run by a public utility district, was still flowing. Regardless of who takes over PG&E, the transition will be “extremely challenging,” he says. “Customers are going to end up paying under any scenario.”
Many have been skeptical of Newsom’s call for Berkshire Hathaway to step in and take over PG&E, which would essentially replace one form of private ownership for another. “It feels a bit like longing for a savior when there isn’t an obvious solution or a cheap solution,” bankruptcy law expert Jared Ellias told the Sacramento Bee. “There isn’t a white knight.” But Geesman thinks it might be less about a white knight and more about upping the competition. “What the governor was emphasizing was the desire to get as many bidders as possible,” he says. Plus, Berkshire Hathaway does have energy expertise with a bent toward renewables, and Warren Buffet has managed to keep a good reputation, which is more than PG&E can say. (Well aware of their fall from grace, PG&E preemptively bought up domain names like pgecrooks.com and pgefailure.com when it filed for bankruptcy.)
While Buffet hasn’t yet indicated any interest in getting involved, PG&E’s bondholders have been looking to wrest control of the company since it went into bankruptcy. As Geesman notes, unlike the shareholders—who have a competing reorganization plan—or an outside group like Berkshire Hathaway, the bondholder group, made up of hedge funds, doesn’t have energy operation experience. (Fire victims are supporting the bondholder plan, which would pay out billions more in compensation.)
But it’s not even certain any of these groups will want to take over anymore. The bondholders’ proposal has a clause allowing them to back out if PG&E is found liable for major damages in a new wildfire. PG&E shares have tanked by roughly 70 percent in 2019, dipping below $4 per share last week, so it is understandable that entities might be scared off. (The shareholder’s bid has a similar clause, and the same logic applies.) In January, courts will begin determining wildfire damages and PG&E’s culpability for the Tubbs fire that ravaged parts of Northern California in 2017.
Still, Geesman doubts either the bondholders or shareholders will drop their bids. “The franchise as it exists today has enormous earning power and that’s what’s attracted the different wolf packs of speculative investors,” he says. “If PG&E has been vilified for the last several years for mismanagement, it’s pretty easy to hypothesize from your office on Wall Street that you could just hire better managers and potentially slice and dice that $20 billion revenue stream in such a way that it makes for a very good investment. Wolves have an innate ability to sense protein. There’s a lot of potential revenue protein in a utility franchise.”
Whoever ends up in charge of PG&E, it’s important to remember that the utility giant didn’t hit rock bottom on its own—and, accordingly, a better future system will almost certainly need more than new ownership. People have long criticized PG&E’s uncomfortably close ties with former Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration and the revolving door between the California Public Utilities Commission and the utilities it regulates. PG&E has spent over $31 million on lobbying in California since 2001, over $8 million of which was spent in 2018. “The regulatory model holds a fair amount of blame” for the current situation, Geesman says. But, “I don’t think this is a problem where you can rationalize, ‘Well, I’ll just appoint better people.’ You really need to focus more on changing that system rather than the individuals responsible for administering it.”
Regulators have failed to hold PG&E accountable in many instances. For example, utilities can use funds from the PUC for certain needs like maintaining equipment, but once they have the money, “very rarely does the commission actually attach strings to that money,” Wall Street Journal energy reporter Rebecca Smith explained on KALW’s “Your Call.” “I think this has allowed the company to do whatever it wanted.” Neglecting to adequately spend on maintenance and equipment over time is one of the biggest criticisms leveled against PG&E. It’s unclear if that kind of (or lack of) oversight would push another company to behave better.
As frustration mounts, more and more people, including presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), seem to believe that the most effective way forward is via municipal control. “It is time to begin thinking about public ownership of major utilities,” Sanders said recently. “The people of California are suffering because of the greed and corruption of utility corporations and their executives.”
But “public ownership” could mean a lot of different things. San Francisco, for instance, offered to buy PG&E’s local power lines for $2.5 billion in September. PG&E rejected its bid in October, but under the proposal, San Francisco would’ve controlled the electrical equipment within the city, allowing it freedom to pick a non-PG&E power supplier. And in San Jose, California’s third largest city, Mayor Sam Liccardo has proposed turning PG&E into a nonprofit customer-owned cooperative. Different than a government takeover, Liccardo likened the cooperative idea to a credit union. The idea has garnered support from more than two dozen mayors and county supervisors who collectively represent about 5 million residents. “A PG&E that needs to rely on junk bonds to finance its future is not a PG&E that California can rely upon, and we need to move forward with a different approach,” Liccardo told KQED.
There has been success with municipal ownership elsewhere; public power utilities exist in cities and localities in every state besides Hawaii. Geesman argues that over the “last several years, probably extending back to the San Bruno experience nine years ago,” it’s been clear that “accountability is most likely to come at the local level, where maintenance issues and investment issues can be intensely scrutinized as opposed to this model that we’ve perpetuated at least a decade too long.” And as energy expert Steven Weissman recently explained to me, “If you’ve got San Francisco Public Utilities Commission as an elected board, and they screw up, then you answer to the voters…Because you’re a local official, and you live locally, you run into constituents in the street, and you go to meetings and you talk to people. The community-level values that are placed on something like safety and reliability can become much higher priorities.”
At the same time, people in communities across the state have already been trying something slightly different: Community Choice Aggregation (CCA), a set-up where a city or county or a combination of the two take over energy purchasing, but the area utility, like PG&E, continues to handle customer service and maintenance. CCAs can then set different rates and offer more energy options, including 100-percent renewable energy (though at a higher cost). Individual residents and businesses in this scenario can opt out and stick with the investor-owned utility. This gives communities more control over prices and more access to alternative energy sources. Only nine states have passed legislation enabling such setups. Currently, there are 19 CCAs in California, and such programs already serve a little under half of PG&E’s customers. In the San Diego area, where CCAs have grown in popularity, San Diego Gas & Electric is exploring handing over power procurement to CCAs entirely, so that the investor-owned company would only be an energy transmission and distribution business (something the California Community Choice Association wants PG&E to do). Theoretically, if utility companies only have to focus on the wires, they’d do a better job of managing risk.
All these options come with their own drawbacks and complications, though at this grand scale, it’s pretty much new ground. Any solution will be complex and difficult and likely require new legislation, and there is still the possibility of mismanagement. Many public entities, of course, lack experience in the energy business. “You’re not going to have a public takeover tomorrow,” Geesman says. “Those things take an extended amount of time.”
Plus, PG&E has yet to signal any desire to turn over control. But if PG&E is found liable for major fire damage yet again, and the shareholders and bondholders use their “out” clauses to withdraw their bids, “then I think the bankruptcy process probably proceeds quite a bit more rapidly into a liquidation,” Geesman says, which paves the way for quicker municipal takeover. If bankruptcy proceedings don’t produce something Sacramento finds acceptable, that’s when Newsom says he might submit the government’s own proposal to the courts.
Unfortunately, in the end, Californians are likely to suffer no matter what happens. “Customers are going to end up paying under any scenario. You’ve got the existing equity value of PG&E down below the $4 billion level. There’s only so much blood in the stone that can be squeezed out going forward,” Geesman says. “The biggest problem that I would envision is a very difficult transition period. What happens while we’re getting from here to there? Who operates the system, and who bears the cost of that? And the customers are the only people with the resources to pick up the bill at the end of the day, and as a consequence, that’s where your financial liability is likely to end up.”
What’s more, the current grid is outdated and in disrepair, and even San Jose’s Mayor Liccardo admits it’d be costly to revamp: “We’re not delusional about the challenges here,” he told the New York Times.
Inevitably, some residents will suffer more than others, causing major equity issues in the short and long term. The state is already seeing it in the aftermath of PG&E’s deliberate power outages, which are disproportionately affecting low-income and other vulnerable communities. “We’ve had some horrible economic despair triggered in these blackouts,” Geesman notes. “I think there’s going to have to be accounting for it.” In just one example, at least 20 low-income seniors who use walkers or wheelchairs were trapped in their apartment complex in Marin County last week when the elevators stopped working during a two-day blackout. During the first round of power outages, PG&E reports showed that at least 8,500 customer with special energy needs due to medical conditions were affected.
That said, the current fiasco also affords an opportunity for real change. Utilities have historically teamed up to block alternative energy systems like microgrids—local community-operated energy grids that can operate and be controlled autonomously. When all the utilities band together, the barriers to reform can be “insurmountable,” Geesman says. But when alliances are destabilized by a weak link, say, “a bankrupt convicted felon who has killed dozens of people over the last several years and is not somebody anyone affords a great deal of credibility to those are pretty good conditions under which to work change.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Meanwhile, Russia, Iran, and Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian government all stand to benefit from President Donald Trump’s decision to green-light the Turkish offensive. But as with any international crisis, American lobbyists are ready to profit, too.
Chief among them is Greenberg Traurig, a white-shoe law firm with a scandalous history that has recently become Turkey’s top lobbyist and a key part of the country’s massive influence campaign in Washington. Greenberg has accepted more than $6.6 million since 2014 to lobby on behalf of Turkey’s government, even as the country’s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has grown increasingly authoritarian—brutally suppressing dissent and imprisoning more journalists than any other country.
Since Trump took office, Turkey has nearly doubled its spending on lobbying in DC, according to Al-Monitor, a news site that reports on the Middle East. No less than 21 different lobbyists were registered with the Justice Department on Turkey’s behalf in 2017, including several firms with close ties to the administration. Ballard Partners, which is run by a top Trump fundraiser, received more than $4 million from Turkey; Mercury Public Affairs, a landing ground for several ex-Trump campaign staffers, earned more than $1.6 million representing the Turkish government and outside advocacy groups such as the Turkey-US Business Council and American-Turkish Council.
At Greenberg, a roster of ex-lawmakers-turned-lobbyists has helped promote Turkey’s interests on Capitol Hill. According to Vera Eccarius-Kelly, a Siena College political science professor who has written about Turkey and the Kurds, the firm’s role among the country’s army of lobbyists is to “improve Turkey’s image in the US,” which it has done by cultivating friendly members of Congress, especially the roughly 100 members of the bipartisan Turkey caucus. Four of the registered lobbyists working for Turkey on Greenberg’s payroll are ex-lawmakers who served on committees that oversee the Pentagon and State Department.
Greenberg’s contract with the Turks has been a crucial part of the firm’s renaissance in Washington after nearly a decade of recovering from the stain left by disgraced ex-employee Jack Abramoff, who went to prison in 2008 as a result of swindling millions of dollars from various Indian tribes, among other crimes. Founded by three attorneys in 1967, Greenberg expanded rapidly in the mid-1990s and gained notoriety for representing President George W. Bush during the 2000 Florida recount. By the time of Abramoff’s trial, Greenberg employed 1,500 attorneys in more than two dozen cities, according to the New York Times. The Justice Department never charged the firm itself in relation to Abramoff’s schemes, which made national news for months and ultimately brought down then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas), But the company took a massive hit. In 2013, Greenberg collected just $3.9 million in revenue—a fraction of the $25.5 million it had earned in 2003, Politico reported.
Abramoff’s scandal may have tarred the firm’s reputation, but it didn’t deal a fatal blow. Various foreign clients, including the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq and Mexico’s agricultural ministry, signed on with Greenberg in the years following the trial. In 2014, the firm received more than $130,000 to lobby for Turkey as a subcontractor for the Gephardt Group, which was founded by former House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt (Mo.). That same year, 13 lobbyists from rival firm Dickstein Shapiro joined Greenberg’s growing Washington, DC, office, including former Sen. Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.) and ex-Rep. Albert Wynn (D-Md.).
By August 2014, Wynn and Hutchinson had registered to lobby for Turkey and, three years later, Greenberg inked a $1.7 million annual deal with Turkey to support “legislation and other US government action that promotes Turkey’s interests and provides a positive image of Turks, Turkey, and the United States-Turkey relationship.” Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Greenberg employee at the time, was not registered as one of the firm’s Turkey lobbyists. But he too helped further Erdoğan’s agenda, pushing Trump in 2017 to extradite a Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania and has been accused by Erdoğan of trying to overthrow him. After becoming Trump’s personal lawyer, Giuliani left Greenberg. He has denied ever lobbying for a foreign client, and Gülen, a permanent US resident, has not been extradited. (In 2015, Turkey hired a different firm, Amsterdam & Partners, to organize an influence campaign geared at undermining Gülen and the network of charter schools linked to him.)
In Trump, Erdoğan found a leader especially receptive to one-on-one lobbying. Both of Trump’s efforts to withdraw US forces from Syria—in December and then against last month—occurred after phone calls in which Erdoğan pushed him to do exactly that. Trump has occasionally threatened Turkey with punitive action, but has more often praised Erdoğan and echoed his talking points. Even after the much-maligned Syria invasion, Trump invited his Turkish counterpart to the White House for a meeting on November 13.
Despite these victories, Turkey has found itself increasingly isolated from the United States in other ways. In May 2017, Erdoğan’s reputation took a massive hit stateside after his security forces brutalized a group of protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence in Washington. Twelve Turkish officials were charged with crimes related to the attack, which the State Department condemned as a threat to free expression. Earlier this year, after Erdoğan agreed to purchase a Russian air defense system, the Trump administration ousted Turkey from the American-led F-35 program, a rare rebuke of a NATO ally. Within Turkey, Erdoğan has repeatedly allied with ultranationalist parties, detained several Americans as hostages, and presided over a historic increase in anti-American sentiment.
Even Washington lobbyists, who have seemingly have represented every warlord under the sun, “have gotten more cautious” around Turkey, Eccarius-Kelly told me. Gephardt, for example, stopped working with Turkey at the end of 2016. Ballard dropped the Turkish government as a client in November 2018 and ended its relationship with Turkey’s state-owned bank last month, after it was indicted over an alleged scheme to evade US sanctions on Iran. But in December 2018, Greenberg re-upped its contact with the Turks for $1.5 million through the end of 2019. Along with Wynn, Hutchinson, and two other registered foreign agents, Greenberg also enlisted ex-Rep. J. Randy Forbes (R-Va.) to begin lobbying for Turkey last year.
Turkey’s Syria invasion has only escalated tensions in Washington. For months, Erdoğan had made no secret of his desire to oust Syrian Kurds from their perch near Turkey’s border, citing their links to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, a revolutionary group that has agitated against the Turkish government since 1984. The Turkish military operation quickly resulted in war crimes, according to the State Department’s envoy to the counter-ISIS campaign. It also created some awkward optics for Greenberg, whose other major foreign client has been the Kurdistan Regional Government, which oversees a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq that is dominated by ethnic Kurds. The KRG has maintained amicable ties with Turkey, but the invasion severely damaged Turkey’s standing among Iraqi Kurds, who were seen burning Turkish flags in the days following the October offensive.
“If I were Turkey and I knew Greenberg was representing the Kurds,” said Craig Holman, a lobbying expert for the nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen, “I’d be inclined to look for a different lobbying firm.”
Greenberg did not respond to multiple requests for comment about its lobbying activities. Federal records, though, suggest the firm hasn’t done much work on behalf of the Kurds in recent months. Between November 2018 and April of this year—the last time the firm submitted its quarterly disclosure to the Justice Department—its lobbyists sent six emails on behalf of the Iraqi Kurdish government and reported zero in-person meetings or phone conversations. During that same period, Greenberg lobbyists met with at least 15 lawmakers to discuss US-Turkish relations and emailed the offices of several others. The KRG paid Greenberg just $30,000 during that time; Turkey paid the firm $809,500.
All of which underscores how valuable Turkey is as a client. “They’re reliable payers,” Eccarius-Kelly said, drawing a parallel to another controversial US ally with an extensive influence operation. “If you can’t have Saudi Arabia as your client, the next best bet is Turkey.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z
https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/ukraine-whistleblower-protection-law/,2019-11-07,,,politics,"November 7, 2019",Outing the Whistleblower Could Be Illegal. Expect Them to Get Away With It.,Pema Levy,MotherJones,Politics,"Over the past week, President Donald Trump and his allies have turned their attention to the whistleblower whose complaint sparked a formal impeachment investigation. While the president’s son on Wednesday tweeted a name he alleged was the person, his camp has been calling on the press to out the anonymous whistleblower, who they claim is a partisan Democrat. Experts on laws protecting whistleblowers say this harassment crosses the bounds of legality, but that it is unlikely the Justice Department will step in.
On Sunday, Trump told reporters that he wanted them to unmask the whistleblower. “The whistleblower gave a very inaccurate report about my phone call,” he said. “You know who it is. You just don’t want to report it. CNN knows who it is, but you don’t want to report it. And you know, you would be doing the public a service if you did.” His Republican allies in Congress have picked up this message. Standing next to Trump at a rally on Monday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) also called for the media to release the person’s name. On Capitol Hill, Republicans have begun pushing the name of a person that conservative publications have reported—without confirmation—is the whistleblower by saying the name in closed-door hearings and tweeting articles containing it. One Congress member, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), said the name out loud in a hearing unrelated to the impeachment inquiry. The campaign reached a new peak on Wednesday when Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a name he fingered as the whistleblower, insinuated the person is anti-Trump, and provided a link to an article purporting to detail the whistleblower’s biography.
While unmasking the whistleblower, which could put the person in harm’s way, may run afoul of federal law, available whistleblower protections are weak. Congress passed a law in 1912 law protecting federal employees’ right to share information with its members and committees, it is so short and sweet that it fails to provide any means of enforcing the right.
The 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act covers most federal employees, but specifically excludes those who work “in a classified environment.” To fill the gap, Congress passed a whistleblower protection law for the intelligence community in 1998. As subsequently amended, the law could shield this whistleblower from official retaliation such as being fired or demoted if the person is in fact, as the New York Times has reported, a CIA officer. But whistleblower advocates have long warned that while the act suggests whistleblowers identities should be kept confidential, there’s no enforcement mechanism. In the current situation, they worry the law is plainly inadequate.
According to Tom Devine, legal director at the pro-whistleblower Government Accountability Project, the statutes that come closest to preventing the president or his allies from naming and harassing the whistleblower were originally designed to protect witnesses in organized crime trials. The Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 makes it a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to obstruct a proceeding of a federal agency or Congress, including any communication meant to impede the investigation. Outing the whistleblower or threatening them with exposure could not only hinder their participation, says Devine, but create a “chilling effect” for future witnesses that may be called or are considering coming forward. That same law, strengthened in 2002, makes it a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison to retaliate against someone for participating in a federal investigation. The comments from Trump and his allies toward the whistleblower are “obviously intended to harass the witness and scare others into silence,” says Devine, and a prosecutor could argue the law applied to any number of Trump allies seeking to interfere with an investigation on his behalf.
Enforcement of any of those laws would require the participation of the Justice Department, which dismissed the whistleblower’s claims of illegality and initially ruled that his complaint need not be shared with Congress. With Attorney General Bill Barr, the president’s close ally, running the department, Devine says it’s unlikely any charges will be brought. “It’s exposing a real catch-22 in our system of legal accountability,” he adds, “when the Attorney General is in bed with a lawless president.”
Republicans hope that they can out the whistleblower and paint him as a Democrat trying to undo the 2016 election and argue that by extension the entire inquiry is a partisan coup. “There have have been stories written about a certain individual, a male,” Trump said on Sunday. “If he’s the whistleblower, he has no credibility because he’s a Brennan guy, he’s a Susan Rice guy, he’s an Obama guy. And he hates Trump,” he said, listing a series of Obama national security appointees under whom thousands of people worked.
If this sounds familiar, it is. Trump and Republicans spent a lot of time trying to discredit the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and his campaign’s links to the effort by claiming the investigation was based on a biased report from British ex-spy Christopher Steele who was commissioned by Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Never mind that the so-called Steele Dossier was not actually the initial catalyst for the FBI’s decision to investigate and that it was originally commissioned by anti-Trump Republicans. Even as evidence of Russia’s interference grew, and detailed indictments piled up, Trump and his allies continued to point to the dossier’s roots rather than grapple with emerging facts to defend the president.
In the impeachment context, the whistleblower’s claims are likewise now a small piece of a much larger puzzle. The narrative outlined in the whistleblower’s report has been confirmed not only by the White House’s own accounts but by contemporaneous records and multiple other government officials who have shared more information on the key events than the whistleblower ever had access to. For this reason, the whistleblower’s lawyers have argued that their client’s identity is irrelevant, writing that calls to force him to publicly testify are “a spiteful campaign” and a “diversionary tactic” that would put their client and “their family at risk of harm.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Officially. THE ALL-CAPS RESET was announced this week in a widely mocked blog post by its chief marketing officer. The rationale: Apparently the company felt the need to distinguish its subsidiary services and products, like WhatsApp and Instagram (owned by the newly styled FACEBOOK), from its main app, Facebook (retaining capitalization).
This fooling-no-one caps-lock maneuver was chosen “for clarity,” marketing chief Antonio Lucio insists, as if THIS IS CLEARER than this. Because having more users than the world’s largest religion has followers, and the three largest countries have people (combined), isn’t conquering enough, controlling enough, self-aggrandizing enough. Facebook had to find another way to go big. Smashing style guides everywhere could be its not-so-subtle attempt to dissuade politicians and the public from dismantling the company, a mounting movement fueled by a distrust of corporate consolidation. That might be the real reason Facebook went FACEBOOK: Too big to fail is now, we’re asked to believe, TOO BIG TO DISMANTLE.
This style switch is the latest attempt to make the company seem distributive and invulnerable to antitrust intervention. No monopoly here, nope. Nothing to break up. We have FACEBOOK and this other appendage, Facebook. See? So many moving and unrelated parts. The world is LOLing at Facebook’s FACEBOOK. Laughter may be cathartic, but a better option is legislative action: The call to break up Facebook is growing louder, and coincidentally the company’s all-caps switch was announced just weeks after the wandering, barely coherent testimony by Mark Zuckerberg in his attempt to be held accountable in a congressional hearing for his company’s harm to elections and democracy. When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez grilled Zuckerberg about Facebook’s breezy indifference to disinformation in political ads, his response was so far from an articulation of a policy that you have to wonder if he even knows his company’s policy—or if his company has one at all. You also have to wonder if Facebook’s corporate copy editors (hey, colleagues) actually equate all-caps with all confidence and a hierarchy of products, or if they don’t see a distinction (or haven’t convinced their marketers there is one).
I don’t mean to single out Facebook’s marketers or copy editors, at least no more than any corporation whose style guide allows ALL-CAPS FOR NON-ACRONYM BRANDS. I’m going after their reasons for doing so. “Clarity,” the stated reason, is a familiar refrain from certain marketers who peddle its opposite: obfuscation. If anything is clear, it’s that Facebook’s ALL-CAPS is not about clarification; it’s an exercise in domination, desperation, overcompensation, and misdirection. These are the imperatives of a Trump era that values SHOUTING as virtue—the stylistic mask for vulnerability. All-caps does not make a brand bigger; it makes it smaller.
Those of us working in media who are fortunate enough to have a shred of independence should AVOID SHOUTING AT READERS. Many good style guides use all-caps only for acronyms and defy the wishes of brands that would have us become their megaphones. It’s Fox (not FOX), Politico (not POLITICO), Wired (not WIRED), and Vice (not VICE); none are acronyms. The corollary is also true: Just because a brand lowercases each letter, like adidas, doesn’t mean we have to oblige, and there’s good reason not to (like consistency and clarity).
If Facebook wants the news media to cap FACEBOOK, the company has to pass a simple acronym test: Are you an acronym? (I’ve asked Facebook’s marketing team whether FACEBOOK is, to their minds, an acronym, and if so, what for. I’ll update this post if I hear back.) Any guesses? I have a few:

Before we get into the whole thing, let’s point out that: 1) Zelensky was a comedian before he ran for president, 2) No one for whom Jay Leno is a hero has any business being a country’s president, let alone a comedian.
All right, here’s the supposed story, per the Washington Post. In an attempt to curry favor with Zelensky after his election, Sondland invited along his “personal friend” Leno to perform at a celebration in Brussels. The paper reported that Leno’s “US-focused patter fell flat on the ears of European officials.” Here’s how Sondland put it:

Why? As an official matter, it’s about the president. Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson, with visions of consulting fees dancing in his eyes, told the New York Times that the former mayor sees fellow New Yorker President Donald Trump as an “unprecedented threat to our nation,” which is what every other Democratic candidate says.
But between the lines, it’s clearly about the Democratic candidates—specifically about the cash-strapped frontrunner Joe Biden and the populist progressives he can’t seem to put away, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
The Times reports:
It’s hard to think of any sizable constituency within the Democratic coalition to which Bloomberg might appeal. He also was a raging sexist out in the open, and his controversial defense and expansion of “stop-and-frisk”—something Trump has praised—will make it hard for him to peel off the Black voters in Biden’s camp. The best thing you can say about him is that in recent years he has decided to spend his money well, throwing mountains of cash behind gun control initiatives and giving Democrats a boost during the 2018 midterm elections.
Warren, on Twitter, seemed gleeful at the prospect of having another billionaire in the primary for a foil:

If you need a refresher, Taylor told lawmakers in his closed-door session last month that Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, had informed him that both military assistance to Ukraine and a White House visit for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would be withheld until Ukraine announced it was launching an investigation into a company connected to Joe Biden’s son. Text message exchanges provided to lawmakers also revealed that Taylor had described it as “crazy” to withhold the aid.
The release on Wednesday came shortly after House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) announced that public hearings would start next week.

Last November, a top Trump appointee at the U.S. Agency for International Development wrote a candid email to colleagues about pressure from the White House to reroute Middle East aid to religious minorities, particularly Christian groups.
“Sometimes this decision will be made for us by the White House (see… Iraq! And, increasingly, Syria),” said Hallam Ferguson, a senior official in USAID’s Middle East bureau, in an email seen by ProPublica. “We need to stay ahead of this curve everywhere lest our interventions be dictated to us.”
The email underscored what had become a stark reality under the Trump White House. Decisions about U.S. aid are often no longer being governed by career professionals applying a rigorous review of applicants and their capabilities. Over the last two years, political pressure, particularly from the office of Vice President Mike Pence, had seeped into aid deliberations and convinced key decision-makers that unless they fell in line, their jobs could be at stake.
Five months before Ferguson sent the email, his former boss had been ousted following a mandate from Pence’s chief of staff. Pence had grown displeased with USAID’s work in Iraq after Christian groups were turned down for aid.
ProPublica viewed internal emails and conducted interviews with nearly 40 current and former U.S. officials and aid professionals that shed new light on the success of Pence and his allies in influencing the government’s long-standing process for awarding foreign aid. Most people spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The Trump administration’s efforts to influence USAID funding sparked concern from career officials, who worried the agency risked violating constitutional prohibitions on favoring one religion over another. They also were concerned that being perceived as favoring Christians could worsen Iraq’s sectarian divides.
“There are very deliberate procurement guidelines that have developed over a number of years to guard precisely against this kind of behavior,” said Steven Feldstein, a former State Department and USAID official during the Obama administration. When politics intrude on the grant-making process, “you’re diluting the very nature of what development programs ought to accomplish.”
USAID regulations state that awards “must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of the religious affiliation of a recipient organization, or lack thereof.”
Last month, USAID announced two grants to Iraqi organizations that career officials had previously rejected. Political appointees significantly impacted the latest awards, according to interviews with officials and other people aware of the process. Typically, such appointees have little to no involvement in USAID grants, to avoid perceptions of undue political influence on procurement.
One of the groups selected for the newest awards has no full-time paid staff, no experience with government grants and a financial tie that would typically raise questions in an intense competition for limited funds. The second organization received its first USAID direct grant after extensive public comments by its leader and allies highlighting what they described as a lack of U.S. assistance to Christians. The two groups — a charity that primarily serves Christian Iraqis and a Catholic university — were not originally listed as front-runners, according to a document seen by ProPublica.
The Wall Street Journal and BuzzFeed have previously reported Pence’s interest in increasing foreign aid to Christians and his displeasure with USAID’s activities in Iraq.
Pence’s spokeswoman, Katie Waldman, did not respond to questions. A USAID spokeswoman did not respond to specific questions, including about Ferguson’s email, but said the latest grants were appropriate.
“The Trump Administration has made responding to the genocide committed by the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) against religious and ethnic minorities a top priority,” said the spokeswoman, Pooja Jhunjhunwala. “Assistance to religious and ethnic communities targeted by ISIS is not a departure from the norm, but rather a continuation of USAID’s rich history of promoting inclusive development and defending human dignity and religious freedom in our partner countries.”
Approximately 97% of Iraq’s population is Muslim, according to the most recent U.S. figures available. Religious minorities — including Christians, Yazidis and others — make up around 2% to 3% of Iraq’s total population.
The Trump administration’s efforts to steer funding to these minorities in Iraq stand in stark contrast to its overall approach to foreign aid. It has repeatedly proposed cutting U.S. diplomatic and foreign assistance budgets by billions of dollars. In August, as the White House was considering cuts to an array of foreign aid programs, it shielded funding for religious minorities abroad, according to news accounts.
As Trump mounts a 2020 reelection effort, he is taking steps to solidify his conservative Christian base, including his decision last week to install his spiritual adviser, Florida televangelist Paula White, in a White House position. Increasing aid to Christians abroad is a core value for his supporters.
In a speech last month at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, a major gathering of the religious right, Trump touted his administration’s work on behalf of religious minorities in Iraq and Syria.
“Other presidents would not be doing that,” he said. “They’d be spending a lot more money, but they’d be spending it on things that would not make you very happy.”
Late in the Obama administration, USAID’s activities in Iraq focused on an effort by the United Nations to restore basic services as soon as cities had been liberated from Islamic State rule.
By the end of 2016, the United States had contributed over $115 million to the effort through USAID, and other countries had contributed hundreds of millions of dollars more. U.S. officials credit the U.N.’s work with enabling millions of Iraqis to return to their homes soon after the fighting was done instead of languishing in refugee camps.
“Here’s another example of when the U.N. and the United States work together, really good things can happen,” said John Allen, the former special presidential envoy to the global coalition formed to defeat ISIS, at an event at the Brookings Institution in September.
Robust U.S. support for the U.N.’s work initially carried over into the Trump administration. In July 2017, the administration announced that USAID would provide an additional $150 million to the U.N. Development Program’s Iraq stabilization fund, bringing the total U.S. contribution to more than $265 million since 2015.
But by then, U.S. officials in Iraq were sensing dissatisfaction among some Iraqi Christians and American religious groups with the U.S. strategy and the U.N.’s work. Trying to head off problems, U.S. officials urged the U.N. in the summer of 2017 to pay special attention to the Nineveh Plains, an ethnically and religiously diverse region of northern Iraq where many of the country’s Christians live.
U.N. officials were reluctant, arguing their assistance could go further in dense urban areas like Mosul, as opposed to the Nineveh Plains, a stretch of farmland dotted by small towns and villages.
“They were going for the biggest bang for the buck,” one former U.S. foreign service officer said.
Dylan Lowthian, a UNDP spokesman, said the agency worked closely with local Christian leaders in 2017 to encourage more people to return to the Nineveh Plains.
“UNDP is one of the largest supporters of minority communities in Iraq in terms of volume of projects, impact, and funding,” Lowthian said.
But the pressure from Washington built. Influential religious groups like the Knights of Columbus and current and former Republican members of Congress advocated throughout 2017 for direct U.S. aid to religious minorities, including Christians and Yazidis. They said that the groups merited special attention because they had been targeted for genocide by Islamic State and that local churches had proven track records of delivering aid quickly and reliably. Furthermore, Christians — who fled the country in droves after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq — were at risk of disappearing from Iraq altogether if they didn’t receive help, they argued.
Bashar Warda, a powerful archbishop based in Erbil, Iraq, was a key figure in this effort. “The Christians of Iraq desperately need American government humanitarian aid now, and we need it to be delivered in a manner to ensure it actually reaches us and does not get absorbed and redirected in the existing aid structures,” he said in a 2017 interview with Crux, a Catholic- focused publication. “While the U.S. has donated generously to the overall humanitarian aid effort in Iraq, almost none of this aid reached the Christians.”
Warda met with Pence in late 2017 and stood beside Trump in the Oval Office in 2018 as he signed a bill authorizing the State Department and USAID to provide relief to victims of Islamic State, particularly religious minorities. Warda had advocated for the bill’s passage.

Sprung is right, and no universal health care plan will succeed unless it addresses our real problem. Here’s an example:
In Britain, a heart bypass costs $24,000. In America the average price is $78,000, and that can skyrocket to $161,000 or more if you’re unlucky enough to get treated at an expensive hospital.
Why? Because heart surgeons in America are paid more. Hospital rooms cost more. Drugs cost more. And, yes, admin costs are higher. This can’t be cured overnight even with the best health care plan, but it can be slowed down and addressed over time. That should be a goal of any universal health care plan worth the name.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed last year by New York’s attorney general, which accused the president of a pattern of “persistently illegal conduct” involving the Donald J. Trump Foundation. Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka were also named in the case.
After the lawsuit was filed, Trump defiantly insisted he would never settle the case:

But settle he did. Last December, Trump agreed to shut down the foundation and give away its remaining money to a list of approved charities, including the United Way, the United Negro College Fund, and the Holocaust Museum. The settlement left the decision on how much Trump should pay in restitution for misusing his charity to the judge in the case, New York Supreme Court Judge Saliann Scarpulla. Scarpulla ruled on Thursday that $2 million—which will be distributed among the same group of approved charities—would be sufficient.
The lawsuit alleged that the Trumps rarely, if ever, held board meetings or discussed foundation business and that much of the money the foundation disbursed was used to help Donald Trump—not serve some broader charitable purpose. The largest donation the foundation made was a $264,000 payment to the Central Park Conservancy in 1989, a contribution that went toward the rehabilitation of a fountain outside of a Trump property in New York City. The foundation was also used to purchase a football helmet signed by Tim Tebow for $12,000 and to buy at least one portrait of Trump, which was later hung in one of the president’s resorts.
In her ruling approving the final $2 million payment and settlement, Scarpulla repeatedly pointed to Trump’s misuse of the foundation during the 2016 presidential campaign. In January 2016, Trump, fueding with Fox News, skipped the cable news channel’s Iowa debate and instead counter-programmed a charity fundraiser, ostensibly to benefit veterans, in Des Moines. The event raised more than $2 million, but documents filed in the lawsuit show that Trump’s foundation ceded total control of how the money would be disbursed to Trump’s campaign.
“Is there any way we can make some disbursements this week while in Iowa?” then–Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski wrote in an email to a Trump Organization executive at the time. The following week, Trump handed out $500,000 in donations from the foundation during a political event. He went on to make doling out checks to local charities part of his campaign-rally routine.
In a statement, New York Attorney General Letitia James said the ruling was a victory for the rule of law.
“The court’s decision, together with the settlements we negotiated, are a major victory in our efforts to protect charitable assets and hold accountable those who would abuse charities for personal gain,” she said. “My office will continue to fight for accountability because no one is above the law—not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the President of the United States.”
In addition to the $2 million payment, Trump was also ordered to reimburse the foundation $11,525 to cover the cost of paying for charity auction items and champagne. James’ office described the auction items as “sports paraphernalia,” an apparent reference to the Tebow helmet.
Under a previously agreed part of the settlement, Trump admitted he misused funds, paid back the cost of purchasing the portrait, and agreed to restrictions on any new charity he might start in the state of New York. Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, were ordered to attend mandatory training sessions on nonprofit management.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) easily topped the 50-percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff in Tuesday’s Republican Senate primary. Two years after tea party activists helped send Ted Cruz to Washington, Cornyn escaped unscathed, and will almost certainly win another term in November. Heading into the primary, the only real drama was whether his opponent, Rep. Steve Stockman, would even vote for himself—Stockman hasn’t voted in a GOP primary election since 2004, which includes both the preliminary and runoff elections in his victorious 2012 campaign.
The Stockman campaign defied convention, often spectacularly so. He made what the Dallas Morning News called a “rare public appearance” on January 14, and then he disappeared. He wasn’t seen for days, during which time he missed 17 consecutive votes and his House office refused to say where he was. Then his staff switched gears, revealing that he had been in Russia, Egypt, and Israel and chiding American reporters for not paying attention to a press conference he’d held overseas. He came back in time for the State of the Union, only to theatrically storm out midway through.
His campaign office was literally condemned. His staff, such as it was, refused to alert reporters to upcoming public events, which may have been because there weren’t any. Seriously—try to find any record that he held one in the last two months. The closest thing to a Stockman campaign effort was a fake newspaper, sent to conservative mail boxes, which quoted Stockman’s campaign literature about Cornyn verbatim, but which the Stockman campaign claimed it had nothing to do with. He filed a libel lawsuit against a pro-Cornyn PAC for alleging he had been jail and charged with a felony for drug possession, despite admitting in 1995 to these allegations in an interview. And he just cold stopped filing campaign finance reports. He raised virtually no money, nor is it clear what, if anything, his campaign spent its cash on. He didn’t run any TV ads. He claimed he had been endorsed by the Tea Party Patriots, when the group had done nothing of the sort.
But the amazing thing about Stockman isn’t his total refusal to campaign—it’s that this is the first time this strategy has failed him. Consider this Houston Chronicle story from 2012:
Sound familiar? Stockman beat Takach. And he went on to win the general election by 44 points, operating out of a garage. He used the same newspaper strategy when he was elected to the House in 1994, too—though he also denied involvement at the time, even though it was being printed at his home address.
Stockman will leave behind no political legacy, unless you were one of the lucky few to receive an “If Babies Had Guns They Wouldn’t Be Aborted” bumper sticker. If you were one of a handful of Texans who donated to his campaign, you would have been better served lighting your money on fire. But he was, nonetheless, a trailblazer. We salute you, Steve Stockman, pioneer of the uncampaign.

On Wednesday, Malaysian police announced that a flight simulator belonging to Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the captain of Malaysia Airlines flight 370, was missing data that had been erased about a month before the plane disappeared, potentially as part of routine computer maintenance. In an investigation that has produced precious few clues—on Thursday Australian officials were investigating debris found via satellite imagery—Shah’s background, naturally, is being closely analyzed by authorities, including the FBI. But Shah—who liked to cook, watched atheist videos, and who was a fan of a democratic opposition leader in Malaysia—didn’t express any suspicious sentiments on his public Facebook page. On the contrary, in an exchange that occurred shortly after the Boston Marathon bombings, he criticized his Facebook friend, Muhammad Khatif Mohd Talha, a self-identified former captain at Malaysia Airlines, for promoting the conspiracy theory that the bombing was a “False Flag attack by the Satanist elite.”
To convince Shah, Talha posted a clip from a press conference during which Boston authorities ignored a shouting conspiracy theorist who claimed that local officials had called for public calm before the bombings. Shah didn’t buy this, and he told Talha it would have been natural for authorities to request calm and order during a large public event.
In the second part of the discussion thread, Talha posted a tweet from the Boston Globe, reporting that Boston officials had announced a controlled explosion as part of post-attack bomb squad activities, as if this supported the notion that the Boston Marathon was some sort of inside job. Shah replied, sarcastically, “Wow now we get to believe the police (GOV) of blewing up people.”
The public Facebook postings do not indicate what kind of relationship Muhammad Khatif Mohd Talha and Shah maintained, if any, in real life. (Talha is one of Shah’s 239 friends.) But they do have several mutual Facebook friends who work in the airline industry. On his Facebook page, Talha, who refers to himself as a former pilot for Malaysia Airlines, expresses support for a wide range of conspiracy theories: “satanic” symbolism in Katy Perry videos, weather warfare, and vaccines and autism. He writes often of a coming apocalypse and is a member of a “Malaysian Preppers” Facebook group, and he posts regularly about his religious beliefs (including his support for Islamic law) and what he believes is the imminent collapse of the global economy. Shortly after the plane’s disappearance, Talha posted, in Malaysian, “Thank you all for your wishes for me. God- willing, I pray for the best for everyone.” Talha did not respond to requests for comment.
Yazran Ahmad, who replied to Talha’s Facebook post above, was Facebook friends with Talha and Shah, and he notes on his Facebook page that he studied at the Malaysian Flying Academy. On March 8, he wrote a poignant note regarding the missing airline. (Ahmad did not respond to request for comment.)

Ben Smith pours cold water on the idea of Jeb Bush running for president:
There’s more, and Smith makes a good case without even bothering to mention Bush fatigue.
But I have to say that I’m mystified right now. In 2012, from the very start, I thought Mitt Romney would win the nomination. Basically, the whole contest boiled down to Mitt and the Seven Dwarves, and eventually I figured Mitt would stomp each dwarf and then, battered and bruised, win the nomination.
But this time around, it’s just dwarves. Like Smith, I have a hard time seeing Jeb Bush making a serious run. Chris Christie still seems terminally damaged by Bridgegate, though I suppose that’s still up in the air depending on what future investigations reveal. Beyond that, I guess Scott Walker is still a possibility—though, in the immortal words of Ann Widdecombe, it’s always seemed as if there’s a bit of the night about him. And Paul Ryan, of course, though it sure doesn’t seem like he’s seriously interested in running.
Beyond that, it’s just the usual clown show of nutballs and C-list wannabes. You can make a great case for why none of them can possibly win. And yet, someone has to win. It’s a mystery.

In January, Mother Jones broke the story of one of the newest affiliates of Charles and David Koch’s sprawling political machine, a consulting firm named Aegis Strategic created to identify, recruit, and groom free-market-minded candidates for elected office. Aegis bills itself as a one-stop shop for aspiring politicians, able to handle general consulting, fundraising, direct mail, social media, and more. The firm is run by Jeff Crank, a radio host and two-time congressional candidate who previously ran the Colorado chapter of Americans for Prosperity, the advocacy group founded by the Koch brothers.
When we reported on the firm earlier this year, Aegis Strategic had only one client: Marilinda Garcia, a New Hampshire state lawmaker running for Congress. But new campaign filings show that Aegis has since signed up at least one more congressional hopeful: Bruce Westerman, the former Republican majority leader of the Arkansas state House.
Westerman is running to replace Rep. Tom Cotton in Arkansas’ 4th Congressional District. (Cotton is now running for Senate and hoping to oust the incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor. Americans for Prosperity has spent millions of dollars attacking Pryor on the airwaves.) Westerman’s campaign paid Aegis $4,000 for strategy consulting in March, campaign records show. (In January, Westerman also tweeted a photo of himself with Brad Stevens, Aegis Strategic’s director of candidate identification, with the message, “Caught up with part of campaign team.”)
According to Westerman’s campaign website, he was the first GOPer to lead the Arkansas House in 138 years. And he wouldn’t have been in that position without the help of the Kochs’ political network, especially Americans for Prosperity. During the 2012 election cycle, AFP reportedly spent upwards of $1 million in Arkansas on mailers, a bus tour (featuring Cliff from the TV show Cheers), phone banking, and grassroots canvassing. That effort helped flip both the state House and Senate from Democratic to Republican control. AFP figured so prominently in the 2012 cycle that the Arkansas Times named the Koch brothers “Arkansans of the Year.”
Both of Aegis’ two congressional clients also have received financial support from Kochworld. Garcia received a $2,500 donation from Koch Industries’ political action committee, two $2,500 checks from AFP-New Hampshire’s Greg Moore, and $250 from Alan Philp, whom Aegis lists as its chief operating officer. Westerman also got a $250 check from Philp.
Now, after AFP helped Westerman succeed in Arkansas, another offshoot of the Koch political operation is working to send him to Washington.

It was early April, debate night for the half-dozen Republican candidates vying to replace retiring Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), and the front-runner, Del. Barbara Comstock, was getting a taste of her own medicine. That is, she was on the receiving end of some premium opposition research.
Comstock earned her stripes as the consummate Washington political operative by digging up dirt on the Clinton White House. She would later go on to hang out a shingle as a hired PR gun and lobbyist for some of DC’s most controversial figures, including ex-Dick Cheney aide Scooter Libby and Blackwater’s Erik Prince. She’d built a career out of driving the narrative.
But now, on stage at a middle school in Sterling, Virginia, all she could do was shake her head as Rob Wasinger, one of her opponents, went on the offensive. Wasinger, a onetime chief of staff to ex-Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback, invoked Comstock’s lobbying work on behalf Carnival Cruise Corporation. The company, he explained, earned $236 million in taxpayer funding from the Hurricane Katrina relief bill in 2005, ostensibly to provide housing for evacuees. But the boats it sent to the Gulf Coast were never more than half full and the cruise company charged more than twice what it would have for an actual cruise.
“How can we possibly trust her to cut government spending when she’s been first in line at the trough?” Wasinger asked.
It was the kind of political hit Comstock mastered as a political operative and opposition research guru.
Comstock’s political ascent began after she attended Georgetown Law, when she returned home to Fairfax County to raise her three kids and take a job with Wolf, her local congressman. She soon moved up the ladder, to a spot on the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, working under Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.)—a Clinton antagonist so devoted to the cause he once shot a pumpkin to prove that White House chief of staff Vince Foster had been murdered.
From a windowless first-floor office, where she changed the locks to keep out even the cleaning staff, Comstock would hold all-night vigils to keep watch over boxes of subpoenaed Clinton administration documents she feared would be stolen by Democrats. Her fixation was the White House travel office, where employees who were considered disloyal were replaced with Clinton allies. It was the administration’s first major scandal (although the president was absolved of wrongdoing), and it was in no small part driven by Comstock’s marathon workdays. At one point, her onetime ally David Brock recalled in his 2001 book, Blinded by the Right, Comstock and a crew of fellow staffers cased a Clinton appointee’s Georgetown house looking for evidence of wrongdoing.
“Working with Barbara Jean Comstock is like having the entire IBM mainframe working with you,” Barbara Olson, a friend and colleague on Burton’s committee, wrote in her memoir. (Olson, who was married to then-Solicitor General Ted Olson, was killed in the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon.) Karl Rove has called her a “walking, talking human computer.”
When the Clinton years came to an end, Comstock jumped to the Republican National Committee’s war room, where she ran the party’s opposition research operation against Vice President Al Gore. Comstock called her unit “Chicks With Attitude”—a dig at the Gore campaign, whose dark arts department had branded itself as the “Men of Zeal“—and crafted a narrative, adopted by the press, of the vice president as a serial exaggerator. “She has a wonderfully devious mind,” one reporter told the New York Post. The Washington Post called her a “one-woman wrecking crew.” After Election Day ended in deadlock, Comstock moved to Tallahassee to monitor the recounts.
After a stint as a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice in the early days of the Bush administration, Comstock cashed in. She started a crisis public relations firm, Corallo-Comstock, and marketed it toward the Bush administration’s most beleaguered allies. Along with repping Scooter Libby and Erik Prince, she was also retained by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) when he was indicted on charges of illegally laundering campaign contributions.
Comstock also lobbied for a collection of high-powered clients including the Recording Industry Association of America, Comcast, Koch Industries, Chiquita bananas, and the private-prison company GEO Group—which at the time was pushing her former employers in the Department of Justice for a new contract. “She has made extensive use of the revolving door both for self-enrichment and for the profits of her clients,” says Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the government watchdog, Public Citizen.
But Comstock had political ambitions of her own. After working for Mitt Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign, she challenged a Democratic member of Virginia’s House of Delegates and became the only Republican to represent an inside-the-Beltway district.
When Wolf announced his retirement in December, Comstock entered the race to succeed him. She quickly became a target in the latest GOP turf war. As an anti-Comstock opposition research document leaked to the Daily Caller in February put it, “She completely represents what the new conservative movement…is moving away from.”
At the debate in Sterling, Comstock fiddled with her smartphone and largely spoke past her competitors, positioning herself as a candidate who could bring suburban women voters back to the party in November. But the chatter kept coming back to her record. “All of us go to tea party meetings—except Barbara,” said Howie Lind, a former state GOP official who is also running in the primary. He was referring to two scheduled meetings with a tea party group in the western part of her district that Comstock had canceled.
Her foes have also zeroed in on a vote she cast in 2008—for Barack Obama. At the April debate, Comstock explained her choice in that year’s Democratic presidential primary by invoking Rush Limbaugh, whose “Operation Chaos” encouraged Republicans to support Hillary Clinton in order to prolong the Democratic nominating process. This explanation, however, made little sense. Virginia’s primary that year predated Operation Chaos and, anyway, the entire point was not to vote for Obama. Days later, her campaign clarified to the Washington Post that her memory was mistaken.
Del. Bob Marshall, a conservative gadfly who came within a handful votes of being the party’s US Senate nominee six years ago, represents Comstock’s most serious challenge for the nomination. A 69-year-old prone to telling long-winded stories on stage, Marshall has a record of eyebrow-raising rhetoric. Sometimes “incest is voluntary,” he said in 1980. And he observed in 2010 that “when you abort the first born of any, nature takes its vengeance on the subsequent children.” Dubbed “Sideshow Bob” by his detractors, Marshall is one of the most right-wing state legislators east of the Mississippi River. Yet he has been reelected delegate 11 times in a district President Barack Obama won by 11 points.
Marshall, like Comstock, can trace his Republican lineage to revered conservative figures. He boasts that as a young Capitol Hill staffer in the 1970s he wrote the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the federal government from paying for abortions. His mentor was Robert “B-1 Bob” Dornan, the Orange County congressman best known for outing a gay Republican colleague on the House floor. Marshall says he and Dornan keep in touch regularly. (To prove his point, he whipped out his cellphone to show me the call log.)
Despite the opposition research hurled her way, Comstock remains the favorite heading into Saturday’s “firehouse” primary, a one-day affair paid for by the state party with fewer polling locations than a regular election. And her bank account is a big reason why.
Comstock’s district is as close as K Street gets to official congressional representation. Her state delegate district includes McLean, the tony Virginia suburb that many GOP powerbrokers call home; as a consequence, her fundraising filings look like a roster of Republican convention speakers. Since 2009, she has received sizable contributions from: one former Republican National Committee chair, two former governors, four former senators, eight ex-congressmen, and three former cabinet officials—plus George W. Bush’s White House counsel, his SEC chairman, his top strategist, his solicitor general, and his dad’s campaign manager. Scooter Libby chipped in, too. Mitt Romney hosted a fundraiser for her first campaign for delegate, and is planning another one in the near future to boost her congressional bid.
Without a comparable Rolodex, Comstock’s frustrated rivals can only sling insults at her donors. Paul Singer, a Republican donor who has given six-figure donations to Comstock’s various campaigns, is in Marshall’s estimation a “billionaire hedge fund manager whose son thinks he married a man”—a reference to Singer’s gay son who has motivated Singer to promote marriage equality. (Comstock has not endorsed gay marriage.)
An April poll from Citizens United PAC gave Comstock a 30-point lead over Marshall. But in part due to her record as a GOP fixer, Democrats, who rarely gave Wolf a serious challenge, view the district—which Romney won by just 3 points—as a possible pick-up opportunity. Last month, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) headlined a McLean fundraiser for the district’s Democratic nominee, Fairfax County supervisor John Foust.
After the debate in Sterling, Comstock made her way through a small crowd of supporters, most of whom want to extend their apologies for the accusations on stage. “They’re bullies,” Comstock said, harking back to another one-time Republican star whose career was derailed by a piece of well-placed oppo. “It’s like George Allen said—you just have to smile.”

	Politics","
Mario Tabraue Sr. was the Cuban American kingpin of a massive Miami cocaine empire. His palatial villa and ruthless multimillion-dollar drug syndicate evoked comparisons to Scarface. Tabraue’s 1989 trial featured testimony that he’d once attempted to dismember the corpse of a federal informant with a machete. Now this 59-year-old ex-drug-lord, who spent more than a decade in prison, has gone from operating outside the law to attempting to shape it on Capitol Hill. Tabraue is quietly bankrolling a lobbying effort—mounted by a former Republican House staffer—to kill legislation that would crack down on exotic-animal parks, such as the one he currently runs on a five-acre ranch outside of Miami.
Tabraue’s Zoological Wildlife Foundation (ZWF), a for-profit outfit that says its mission is to raise awareness about endangered species, has become one of the top destinations in South Florida for animal lovers in the 15 years it has been in business. Tabraue’s preserve boasts a collection of rare animals, including two-toed sloths, peregrine falcons, a snow leopard, and a citron-crested cockatoo. He even has a liger (a cross between a lion and a tiger).
But a pending bill could put Tabraue’s operation—and others like it—out of business. The Big Cats and Public Safety Protection Act, first introduced in 2012 by Rep. Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), would restrict the acquisition of big cats to accredited zoos and require private owners to register their animals. In response, Tabraue hired Frank Vitello, a former Republican staffer on the House Natural Resources Committee, to lobby against the legislation. Since 2013, the ZWF has paid Vitello’s firm $80,000.
McKeon’s legislation was motivated by a 2011 episode in which a Zanesville, Ohio, man released 56 exotic animals into the community before taking his own life. The animals, including 18 tigers and 17 lions, were on the loose for an afternoon as sheriff’s deputies desperately tracked them through the countryside. Forty-eight animals were shot dead by local enforcement.
To animal rights groups, this was a teachable moment that illustrated the dangers of a lightly regulated system in which almost anyone can possess exotic animals. The Department of Agriculture, which regulates exotic-wildlife exhibitors, currently has no oversight over people who simply keep lions, tigers, and cheetahs as pets, and accordingly law enforcement agencies have no way of knowing what and how many animals are being kept in the vicinity of the public. While a licensing process exists for people who want to display and breed big cats as a business venture, it amounts to a rubber stamp.
Actress Tippi Hedren (of Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds), who operates a preserve of rescued big cats in McKeon’s district that includes a tiger that once belonged to Michael Jackson, convinced McKeon to take action to prevent future disasters like Zanesville. In 2012, she visited McKeon at his Washington office, screening for the congressman a four-minute video on the abuse of big cats. “He said, ‘Oh my God,'” Hedren recalls. McKeon introduced his bill later that year. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced a similar version in the Senate. McKeon’s bill would allow members of the American Zoological Association, the preeminent accrediting body for zoos and aquariums, to continue to acquire new cats. But it would put an end to the practice for everyone else. Existing collections would be grandfathered in—but their businesses would die off with their animals, and it would be illegal to breed new ones. “Our main effort is to go out of business,” Hedren says. “Hopefully we never have to have sanctuaries to take care of these animals.”
The first version of the bill faced fierce opposition from the powerful circus lobby and went nowhere. In response, McKeon carved out an exemption for accredited circuses and reintroduced the legislation in 2013. But traveling road shows were still uneasy. So were private exotic-animal preserves and what activists derisively call “roadside zoos.” Companies including Tabraue’s ZWF joined Feld Entertainment, the parent company of Ringling Bros., in opposition to the bill. “Kenneth Feld [the company’s CEO] has accused me of trying to stop his family business,” Hedren says. “And you know what? I am. I hate the circuses with the animals.”
In the lobbying circus that has emerged over the legislation, Tabraue’s own exotic past stands out. In the late 1980s, he was convicted on 61 counts of racketeering. The cover for his drug operation, according to the federal agents who spent a decade building the case against him, was an exotic-animal import business called Pets Unlimited.
Tabraue’s lobbyist, Vitello, says his client’s controversial background is irrelevant. “This is a policy bill,” he says. “And it’s bad policy, and that’s why I have no reservations at all about opposing it.” (Tabraue referred all questions about the legislation to Vitello and did not respond to email requests for comment.)
The feds first zeroed in on Tabraue in 1981. During a narcotics investigation dubbed Operation Giraffe, they raided his estate and found six tons of marijuana. But the case, spearheaded by Janet Reno, then a young Dade County state attorney, was tossed out by a judge after Tabraue’s lawyer argued that the hundreds of hours of incriminating wiretaps amassed by investigators had been improperly obtained.
At the time, Tabraue had two cheetahs, five monkeys, six cobras, four rattlesnakes, a toucan, and several dozen other animals at his Coconut Grove mansion, a luxurious spread federal agents called the “Playboy mansion.” He laid claim to the only living two-headed python in North America. Even by the flashy standards of Miami Vice-era South Florida, Tabraue’s collection of exotic animals raised eyebrows among his neighbors, who also wondered why men with guns were patrolling the property.
In 1985, federal agents again descended on his property. This time, the operation was conducted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which confiscated two cheetahs, charging that Tabraue illegally acquired the endangered animals. The cheetahs “were found to be in very poor physical condition,” the agency noted in its annual report.
dc.embed.loadNote('//www.documentcloud.org/documents/1153689-doc305/annotations/156269.js');
Tabraue eventually fessed up about how he obtained some of his animals, telling federal investigators that he had once paid a writer and parrot activist named Tony Silva to smuggle 35 endangered hyacinth macaws into the US inside of PVC pipes. Tabraue lent some of his animals to zoos, he sold some at his store, Pets Unlimited, and he kept others as pets. (Silva, who pled guilty to the illegal importation of protected animals, now runs a small business in Miami helping people raise exotic birds.)
In 1987, Tabraue was taken down in Operation Cobra. According to federal prosecutors, Tabraue had been the “chairman of the board” of a cocaine and marijuana trafficking network worth $75 million. At one point, investigators charged, he had stored 10,000 pounds of marijuana at the Parrot Jungle, a Miami-Dade tourist attraction owned by a friend. As the FBI was arresting Tabraue and his crew, an associate tossed a bag containing $50,000 in cash out the window of Tabraue’s house. A federal agent caught it. (Also nabbed in the operation was Orlando Cicilia, brother-in-law of GOP Sen. Marco Rubio; Cicilia was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his involvement.)
Prosecutors alleged that Tabraue and his father, Guillermo, a Bay of Pigs veteran who ran a jewelry store in Miami’s Little Havana, had masterminded the entire network. But Guillermo’s charges were reduced to tax evasion, after a witness testified that Guillermo had been an informant for the CIA.
Tabraue was also implicated in the murder of Larry Nash, an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. According to trial testimony, Tabraue’s henchmen murdered Nash in Tabraue’s car and then brought the body to Tabraue, who attempted to hack it to pieces with a machete. When that failed, his associates used a chainsaw to finish the job and then set Nash’s remains ablaze.
dc.embed.loadNote('//www.documentcloud.org/documents/1149965-tabraue-indictment/annotations/156267.js');
Tabraue was not charged in connection with Nash’s murder, but he was charged with orchestrating the 1981 execution of his first wife, who had threatened to provide evidence of his operation to the feds. But Tabraue beat the charge. The Miami Herald credited his success to the skill of his lawyer, Richard Sharpstein, who popped his collar and smoked a cigar during closing arguments in homage to Columbo. The Herald reported that “Tabraue winked and smiled at his second wife, Diusdy, when the jury found him not guilty of ordering the 10-shot execution of his first wife, Maria.”
Sentenced to 100 years in prison, Tabraue only served 12. Against the wishes of the federal agents who had locked Tabraue up and his trial judge (who’d since died), he was released in 2000 after testifying against other members of the Miami underworld. “He epitomized the most ruthless and violent of all the drug dealers during that time,” an ATF agent who had helped bring him down said when Tabraue was released.
“I was crazy back then,” Tabraue told the Herald in 2000. “I’m not proud of the crimes I committed. I’m not proud I had to cooperate with the authorities either, but there came a time when I had to come clean. I’ve learned a better way. It’s not like I only did six months. I did 12 years hard time in a place where stabbings are a normal thing.”
After his release from prison, he founded Zoological Imports 2000 Inc. (later changing its name to the Zoological Wildlife Foundation). Though he’d previously copped to acquiring animals from a smuggler—and using his pet business as a cover for a vast criminal conspiracy—thanks to the USDA’s lax licensing standards, Tabraue was able to get back into the exotic-animals business.
For big-cat advocates, exhibitors like Tabraue make McKeon’s bill necessary. “I’d say probably 10 percent of the people out there are causing 90 percent of the problems,” says Carole Baskin, founder of the South Florida preserve Big Cat Rescue.
Under current law, individuals who have been convicted on animal cruelty charges are prohibited from obtaining exotic-animal licenses for only a year. No other criminal convictions are considered disqualifying. “Older issues that have been resolved and are nonrecurrent may be evaluated, but do not by themselves provide clear regulatory basis for denial,” says Tanya Espinosa, a spokeswoman for the agency’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. To get licensed, Tabraue merely had to pay a small fee (about $485 annually) and pass an inspection in less than three tries. And regulators have their hands full—the illegal exotic animal trade is second only to the illegal drug trade in the United States.
Since returning to the exotic-animal business, Tabraue has drawn scrutiny from the USDA. In a 2009 consent decree, he admitted to having “knowingly made false and fraudulent statements” to a USDA inspector about the acquisition of two tigers and having “knowingly provided” the inspector with two “false and fraudulent” forms to back up his claims.
Routine inspections have also revealed infractions: electrical cords in the sloth enclosure; a white tiger that did not have regular access to potable water; “several toxic substances in the animal areas and the feed storage area”; missing acquisition records for an alpaca, gibbon, owl monkey, and six wolves; and tigers “at risk for escape.”
To wildlife advocates, Tabraue’s biggest sin is that he’s branding himself as a conservationist. In an interview with the Hill last August—which did not mention his drug-running past—he warned that the McKeon’s bill “would destroy conservation programs that we, as private individuals, have created.” On Tabraue’s website, he frames ZWF’s work as a heroic struggle: “Help us save endangered species.” Among the conservation “success stories” touted by ZWF are a baby tabby tigers and African white lions that his live at his preserve. Tabraue claims that these animals are “extinct in the wild.” But tabby tigers and white lions are just regular tigers and lions whose recessive genes give them rare colorations; virtually nonexistent in the wild, their populations are sustained by (often deliberate) inbreeding by exotic-animal owners. The American Zoological Association banned such deliberate breeding by its members in 2008.
Talk of protecting rare animals is a common marketing tactic. “Everybody wants to be a conservationist,” says Tracy Coppola, campaigns director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, a leading supporter of the McKeon bill. “To toss around the term ‘conservation’ in that context is really unfortunate.”
McKeon’s bill, meanwhile, is stuck in committee—and it seems likely to stay there for this session of Congress. With Congress gearing up for a nasty midterm election, there’s not much appetite for a big fight over big cats. “It’s a challenging time in Congress for bill movement,” Coppola concedes. Even for ligers.

Bullet: dodged. North Carolina speaker of the house Thom Tillis cruised to victory in Tuesday’s North Carolina Republican Senate primary, setting up a general election showdown with Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) this fall. Democrats had held on to hopes that Tillis, who was endorsed at the last minute by Mitt Romney, would fall short of the 40-percent threshold needed to win the race outright and head into a runoff with Greg Brannon, a far-out tea party doctor backed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)
In another election year, Tillis would have been branded the conservative crusader. As the leader of an unpopular state legislature that shifted hard to the right in 2013, Tillis sparked a protest movement and national outrage over his steep budget cuts to social services and harsh restrictions on abortions. In 2011, he told a crowd he planned to “divide and conquer” people who received government assistance and subject them to drug tests. The state’s voter ID law, passed with Tillis’ support, is among the nation’s strictest. The legislature even banned state scientists from calculating sea level rise—just in case.
But Tillis struggled for months to win over the Republican base. At one point, tea party activists leaked audio of an angry Tillis chewing out conservative activists for having the gall to suggest that he was not wearing his “big boy pants.” But while North Carolina conservatives seemed to be clamoring for a better choice, they never settled on an alternative. When Reps. Renee Ellmers and Virginia Foxx decided to sit it out, the best they could come up with was Brannon, an OB-GYN who runs a chain of crisis pregnancy centers in the state and picked up the endorsement, in October, of Paul.
But Brannon was a singularly flawed candidate (even the insurgent-friendly Senate Conservatives Fund sat this one out), which might explain why Paul never came to visit until this Monday. He endorsed the right of a state to nullify federal laws he doesn’t agree with and spoke at a rally co-sponsored by a pro-secession organization, the League of the South. He called food stamps “slavery” and pledged to get rid of the Department of Agriculture. He dabbled in 9/11 trutherism. He floated a novel theory that Planned Parenthood is trying to kill newborns. He dismissed public education as a Marxist plot that “does nothing but dehumanize” kids. When a Huffington Post headline featured a “GOP Candidate:” story anytime in the last seven months, there was a fifty-percent chance that candidate was Brannon.
So it’s not surprising that he lost and Tillis won. What’s surprising is that anyone—especially an aspiring presidential candidate with dreams of making nice with big-time donors—thought fit to elevate Brannon in the first place.

For months, conservatives have thrown their money and might behind Mississippi state Senator Chris McDaniel in an effort to defeat longtime Sen. Thad Cochran in the state’s GOP Senate primary. Tea party activists swooned over McDaniel as the candidate who, in a year of failed challenges from the right, could succeed in knocking off a GOP incumbent. Mississippians went to the polls on Tuesday and gave McDaniel a slight edge over Cochran. A run-off is likely. With a fired-up base behind him, McDaniel is in a solid position to defeat the six-term senator.
As Mother Jones has reported, McDaniel is a southern conservative with a controversial track record. Last summer, he delivered the keynote address at an event hosted by a chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a neo-Confederate group that, as my colleague Tim Murphy wrote, “promotes the work of present-day secessionists and contends the wrong side won the ‘war of southern independence.'” McDaniel spoke at past Sons of Confederate Veterans-affiliated events, according to a spokesman for the group.
From 2004 to 2007, McDaniel hosted a syndicated Christian conservative radio program, Right Side Radio. Once, McDaniel weighed in on gun violence in America by blaming “hip-hop” culture. “The reason Canada is breaking out with brand new gun violence has nothing to do with the United States and guns,” he said in a promotional sampler for the radio show. “It has everything to do with a culture that is morally bankrupt. What kind of culture is that? It’s called hip-hop.” He went on:
McDaniel also used his radio show to defend the efficacy—despite reams of evidence saying otherwise—of torture as a way to gather intelligence.
In April, McDaniel raised eyebrows when he appeared on a different radio show, “Focal Point,” hosted by the Bryan Fischer, an top official at the rabidly anti-gay American Family Association. Here’s a brief rundown of Fischer’s penchant for bomb throwing:
Mark your calendars: A McDaniel-Cochran run-off would take place on June 24.

A month after images first surfaced of pro-gun activists flaunting semiautomatic rifles at Target stores, the retailer has become the latest US company to officially reject firearms in its outlets.
“Our approach has always been to follow local laws, and of course, we will continue to do so,” Target said in a statement Wednesday. “But starting today we will also respectfully request that guests not bring firearms to Target—even in communities where it is permitted by law.”
The move follows weeks of pressure from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, which used social media, online petitions, and protests at Target stores to call for such a change.
Still reeling from its disastrous failure to secure customers’ personal data, Target leaders “were really nervous” after the gun issue emerged, a person with direct knowledge of the company’s discussions about it told me. “This was the last thing they needed.” Still, the company endured weeks of negative attention on the issue, even as Texas authorities and one of Target’s corporate strategic partners made clear that Target was trying to stop the guns from coming in.
Target joins a growing list of corporations—including Starbucks, Jack in the Box, Chipotle, Sonic, and Chili’s—that have reacted to demonstrations by open-carry activists by announcing that they don’t want people carrying guns on their premises.
Whether open-carry activists will comply with Target’s request appears to be an open question. One of the first to comment on Target’s posted statement was Kory Watkins—a leader of a Texas open-carry group that’s conducted provocative demonstrations, used disturbing intimidation tactics against women, and harassed a Marine veteran—who said he plans to pack heat at Target “today and tomorrow and whatever days I want.”
Carrying rifles on display in public is legal in Texas, although regulations governing Target’s sale of alcoholic beverages forbid guns on their premises, and armed patrons who don’t leave upon request could be subject to criminal trespassing charges, according to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission.

Tea party favorite Chris McDaniel spent the final weekend before Tuesday’s Mississippi Republican senatorial run-off campaigning with a conspiracy theorist who has alleged that President Barack Obama is a “Manchurian candidate” working as part of a secret plan to “destroy the country.”
The remarks, first reported by Right Wing Watch, were made by former Libertarian presidential candidate Wayne Allyn Root who has been pushing this anti-Obama charge for years. This past weekend, Root—who was a classmate of the president at Columbia University—traveled throughout Mississippi on a bus paid for by the Tea Party Express and spoke at rallies in support of McDaniel, who is trying to defeat incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran in a hotly contested race. McDaniel accompanied the bus for three events this past weekend.
During a rally in Biloxi, McDaniel took the stage after Root fired up the crowd with his anti-Obama rant. At that event, Root noted that the shadowy effort dates back to the early 1980s:

Root went on to explain the covert plan, suggesting that Obama didn’t really attend Columbia:
Before and during the campaign, McDaniel has showed no reluctance to associate himself with advocates of extreme right-wing views. He has hobnobbed with neo-Confederates and anti-gay crusaders. None of this has become a campaign issue.

Iraq War vet Larry Smith is the Republican nominee to take on Rep. Filemon Vela (D-Texas) in November. He’s also, it turns out, an armchair psychiatrist. According to Smith, Barack Obama’s handling of the child refugee crisis along the Mexican border suggests the president is suffering from Münchausen syndrome by proxy, a rare psychological condition that causes caretakers to abuse kids.
“Today, we hear of reports that children are being abused, being used by drug cartels, and even dying,” Smith said in a statement on his website last Thursday. “If a high school administrator prompted such mass abuse, that person would quickly be without a job and perhaps even found behind bars. The mental stability of the school administrator would be in question. Is a President of the United States who does such horrific acts deserving of less scrutiny and accountability?…People who intentionally hurt children for attention can be accused of Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy.”
Münchausen syndrome by proxy is often tabloid fodder and often deadly. In June, a New York mother believed to be suffering from the affliction was charged with second-degree depraved murder and first-degree manslaughter after feeding her son so much salt he became brain-dead. In another Münchausen case in 2011, an Arizona mother was charged with child abuse for deliberately poisoning her daughter.
The syndrome is itself controversial; Helen Hayward-Brown, an Australian medical anthropologist, warned in 1999 that the condition is consistently misdiagnosed, to the point where parents of children suffering from chronic illnesses are instead being accused of child abuse. Although Münchausen syndrome by proxy often results in child abuse, most child abuse cases have nothing to do with the disorder. The Cleveland Clinic estimates that about 1,000 cases of child abuse (out of 2.5 million annually) are a result of the illness.
Conservatives have been quick to capitalize on reports of crowded immigration detention centers over the last month. Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), who represents a South Texas district that neighbors Vela’s, called the crisis “Obama’s Katrina.” On Tuesday, former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin called for the president to be impeached over his handling of the flood of migrants. Smith, though, is the first to claim that the crisis has been triggered by Obama’s medical condition.
Immigration isn’t the only area where Smith has taken aim at conventional wisdom. On Sunday, he was denounced by the Council on America Islamic Relations for comments he made in a Corpus Christi newspaper about Islam. Citing his experiences as an Army captain in Iraq, Smith had called the faith “horrendously oppressive to children and women.” After receiving a critical note from an American Muslim, Smith went even further. “I was slightly misquoted in the article but that being said I will not back down in my thinking,” Smith wrote on his Facebook page. “If the majority of Muslims are peace-loving then as a well traveled man I should have met one by now.”
What’s more, Smith argued that the woman who had written to him was an apostate, because the tolerant and loving faith she described did not exist. “From my experiences overseas to watching, listening, and reading from numerous sources I have come to a conclusion: you are not a muslim.”
He concluded: “I do not believe in Christianity because I read a 2,000 year-old book. I believe in it because I have witnessed it first hand. And because I have witnessed Islam, I believe in it for what it really is: The death of humanity.”
Smith faces an uphill battle against Vela, though, who was elected to the newly drawn seat in 2012 with 62 percent of the vote.

By the slimmest of margins, liberal JoAnne Kloppenburg, a long-time assistant attorney general, upset conservative sitting justice David Prosser in the race to fill the seventh seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Kloppenburg topped Prosser by a mere 204 votes in a race in which 1.48 million Wisconsinites cast a vote. In a statement declaring herself the winner, Kloppenburg said, “Wisconsin voters have spoken and I am grateful for, and humbled by, their confidence and trust…. I look forward to bringing new blood to the Supreme Court and focusing my energy on the important work Wisconsin residents elect Supreme Court justices to do.”
Not so fast, says Prosser’s team. It’s almost certain that Prosser will demand a recount of the election, which would be the first statewide recount in 20 years. And depending on how the recount goes, Prosser has the option of legally challenging the election results, not unlike former US Sen. Norm Coleman’s challenge in his battle against Al Franken, a legal fight Franken ultimately won. And like the Coleman-Franken legal battle, a challenge by Prosser could potentially end up before Wisconsin’s Supreme Court on which he currently sits. The election, in other words, is hardly over.
Nonetheless, Kloppenburg’s unofficial victory marks a momentous win for the labor unions and progressive groups that galvanized her campaign and propelled her from an also-ran to a competitive candidate. The Prosser-Kloppenburg race was seen as a proxy fight pitting unions and progressives against Republican Governor Scott Walker and his Republican colleagues who want to kneecap public-sector unions in Wisconsin. Heading into election day, the stakes were high: A Kloppenburg win would prove that unions are still a force to be reckoned with on election day. But if Kloppenburg lost, the movement sparked by the Wisconsin protests would undoubtedly lose some of its momentum, and conservatives would dismiss the uprising in Wisconsin as a flash in the pan.
Mind you, the fact that Kloppenburg was even competitive in the race was a victory for unions and progressives. As I reported yesterday,
Now, it looks like Prosser’s the one who could come up short. If a recount confirms Kloppenburg as the winner, it would seal one of the most momentous election upsets in years.

While we’re on the subject of pizza tycoons, GOP presidential candidate and former Godfather’s CEO Herman Cain was asked yesterday how he’d approach his duties as Commander in Chief if elected. Would his lack of experience and professed ignorance of foreign policy issues be a problem? It would not be a problem, Cain says. Per the Daily Caller:
As it happens, many of the places American troops are deployed are places where American parents wouldn’t want their kids to be. That’s because the decision to enter a war zone—where the loss of human life is an assumed risk—is a lot different than the decision to deliver pizza to the wrong side of the tracks. There was a time where sending a teenager to Omaha constituted a daring military decision, but those days are thankfully over.
For Cain, meanwhile, foreign policy has quickly and predictably emerged as his most obvious weakness as a candidate. He has demonstrated (and confessed to) a lack of knowledge about the rest of the countries in the world, telling the Christian Broadcasting Network’s David Brody last week that foreign policy is “an area that I have not focused on because when I was doing on my radio show, foreign affairs didn’t come up that often in terms of what my listeners wanted.” Despite making support for Israel the centerpiece of his campaign, he was not familiar with the concept of Palestinian “right of return”; despite the fact that American forces have been in Afghanistan for more than nine years, he isn’t really sure what he thinks about the war there. On China, he is simultaneously blunt and ambiguous: “My China strategy is very simple: outgrow China.” On Sunday, Cain alleged that President Obama was raised in Kenya, which suggests that either Cain doesn’t know anything about President Obama’s upbringing but is talking about it anyway, or that he thinks Hawaii is Kenya.
This wouldn’t be such a big deal, except Cain believes that, more than any other living American, he is most qualified to serve as Commander in Chief. That’s looking like a tough sell.

Tell friends you’re going to a classic-rock show in San Francisco and bands like Furthur and Journey might come to mind. The last thing they’d expect is a gun-toting Glenn Beck pal with a ranch in Texas, unless they knew that 62-year-old Ted Nugent regularly swings through town on his US tours—which have been happening for 40 years and counting. It’s no surprise that a guy who draws cheers from his audience by exclaiming, “Let’s hear it for dead shit on the fucking grill!” once got in a tiff with SF animal-rights protesters that ended up with a 21-year-old activist being hauled off to jail. That was 11 years ago. In an email after his most recent show, Nugent told me he hadn’t run into any trouble this time around. “But I was lookin’.”
I arrive outside The Independent, a venue that’s a bit small for Nugent’s oversized persona, 15 minutes before the doors open. There are about six dozen people waiting in line, mostly middle-aged white guys, some donning an assortment of wide-brimmed hats and camo. It’s not exactly the mix of youthful hipsters and aging hippies you normally encounter at shows around here.
Most of these guys it seems, have been Nugent fans since the 1970s, but up at the front of the line, I spot an anomaly: a young couple from San Francisco’s Marina District. “We’re very conservative,” explains the man, noting that he, like Nugent, is an avid hunter. There probably aren’t many people here from the city, he wagers.
Indeed, standing next to the couple are a group of Nugent fans from out of town.
“Most of us still like Bush,” one offers.
“Only one guy in our group doesn’t,” a friend chimes in. “He’s gay, though.”
“I’m married with kids!” the guy objects.
“Most of us are armed, too.”
Another guy, sporting a goatee and Harley-Davidson T-shirt, smokes a stogie and sips a tallboy from a paper bag between puffs. His name, he says, is Evil Genius, and “everyone will know who that is.” He raps off a sampling of his favorite poetry, eyeing my steno pad to ensure I’m taking it down. There once was a man from Madras / His balls were made of spun brass / In stormy weather / He clung them together / And lightning shot out his ass.
Nugent hails from Detroit, not Madras, but the words are apt. A man in the middle of the line wears an “Uncle Ted Wants You!” shirt, on which a beaming Nugent with an NRA button pinned to his chest clutches a lightning bolt. (Later, during the show, Nugent displays his trademark crude cockiness: “Let’s hear it for the tightest fucking band in the world!”)
At the back of the line, a man who’s been into Nugent ever since listening to the double-platinum Free-for-All on eight-track in the seventh grade tells me, “I hope he’s not too political. I’m here for the music.”
At first, the guy gets his wish. Opening act and fellow Detroiters Brent James & the ContraBand play just one vaguely political song, a shout-out to the troops. When Nugent first takes the stage, his band is pure rock-and-roll exuberance and little else as it launches into high-energy renditions of “Free-for-All” and “Spirit of the Wild.”
Of course, Nugent’s backdrop is a giant American flag, and it’s a secret to no one that he’s a bit of an oddity in this liberal haven. Soon enough, he’s ragging on California in general—”The Independent? I didn’t know that was legal here”—and telling off-color jokes about San Francisco’s Chinatown District. He introduces “Dog Eat Dog” by suggesting that people eat sweet-and-sour dog, and boasts that he dined on tiger-dick soup earlier in the day—a claim that becomes one of the evening’s running themes.
Example: It being the fifth of July, Nugent deems it “Defiance Day”—an extension of Independence Day. He honors the occasion by shouting, “The status quo can suck my tiger dick, along with everyone in the White House!” It’s not quite to the level of telling Barack Obama to “suck on my machine gun,” as he did at a show four years ago, which is probably for the best. It gets the point across nonetheless.
Meanwhile, Nugent’s friend Kevin Russell watches from the VIP balcony. Russell’s from Detroit, too, and his band 707 toured with Nugent in the early ’80s. “We don’t talk about guns and we don’t talk about politics and we don’t talk about hunting,” he says. “We talk about guitars and Detroit. That’s all I’ll say about that.”
Perhaps to the liking of his less politically inclined fans, Nugent spends no time discussing Obama’s potential Republican opponents in 2012, so I ask him for his thoughts in my email. “I admire all of them to varying degrees,” Nugent replies, “but I am praying Texas Gov. ‘Rock’ Perry runs.” He also leaves gay marriage alone at the show, but emails that it’s part of the “cult of denial regarding what marriage actually is.”
Nugent, who credits his impressive stamina in part to lifelong sobriety, does at least take a shot at Bay Area hippies. “It smells like California in here,” he accuses the crowd halfway through the set, although the room has more of a booze-and-BO odor than that familiar skunky scent.
Growing up in Detroit, Nugent tells his crowd, everyone sounded as good as he does tonight. “Then all the dumb motherfuckers got stoned, and I’m the only one left.” In his email, Nugent later laments that his hometown has “died an ugly, tortured, self-inflicted suicide thanks to 40 years of liberal shysters.” Today, he says, “Detroit is now a spirit more than a city.” (Read Charlie LeDuff’s great piece on the city’s woes here.)
During his encore, Nugent continues to toss political correctness to the, er, tigers. He retakes the stage in his signature Indian headdress to play “Great White Buffalo.” Not long after, all four band members are wearing army helmets. An American flag is planted in a prop rock at center stage and the aging rockers strike an Iwo Jima pose. They end the show by raising what appear to be assault rifles above their heads as Nugent shouts, “Never forget, motherfuckers! Never forget!”
My liberal sensibilities tell me that I should be offended by any number of things that I’ve witnessed tonight. I can’t help but laugh, though. The man’s a hell of an entertainer and he knows it.

Tea partiers love Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. A rock star who frequents their events, he speaks the tea partiers’ language, especially when it comes to invoking the Constitution as the basis for opposing everything from President Obama’s health care reform law to environmental regulations on climate-changing emissions. But Cuccinelli seems to have studied the Constitution the way most tea partiers have—in someone’s living room. Because when it comes to actually practicing law, in real courts where the Constitution is really put to the test, Cuccinelli is a bit of a disaster.
Today, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative appellate courts in the country, threw out Cuccinelli’s lawsuit challenging Obama’s Affordable Care Act and its individual mandate. The 4th Circuit never really got to the constitutional issues of the health care law because it found that Cuccinelli and the state of Virgina did not even have standing to bring the case. The individual mandate, the court found, “imposes no obligations on the sole plaintiff, Virginia,” meaning that Virginia had no injury nor future harm that might be remedied by the intervention of a federal judge.
It’s a classic example of something Cuccinelli should have learned in Civil Procedure 101: Just because you don’t like a law doesn’t mean you have the right to go to court and get it struck down. You have to be affected by the law somehow, and it was clear from the very beginning that Cuccinelli and Virginia were not. And if Cuccinelli is hoping the U.S. Supreme Court might come to his rescue on this one, he’s probably dreaming. While you never know with the Roberts court conservatives, who have proven far more political than consistent, stalwart conservatives like Antonin Scalia.  Roberts himself has been extremely harsh with plaintiffs on standing issues. (See Robert’s dissent in Massachusetts v. EPA, a case challenging the EPA’s inaction on climate change.)
But Cuccinelli’s legal work isn’t, of course, about the law. It’s about politics. His concern with constitutional issues is rather selective. Otherwise, how to explain his office’s defense of local law enforcement officials in the state arresting gay men under sodomy laws the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional eight years ago? Or his legal opinion that state universities have no legal right to protect students and staff against anti-gay discrimination, despite the 14th Amendment’s promises of equal protection under the law? Or what of his waste of taxpayer dollars suing over the health care bill in a case he had no legitimate right to bring? The health care lawsuit won Cuccinelli fans across the country, who will no doubt come in handy when he needs to raise money when he runs for senator or governor down the road. All of that might make him a good politician, but it still makes him a bad lawyer.

A Thanksgiving deadline to deliver a plan to cut $1.2 trillion from the federal budget looms larger every day for Congress’ 12-person “super committee,” split evenly between Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate. Failure to reach consensus will trigger across the board cuts to the Defense Department, Medicare, and plenty more federal agencies and programs. But as the super committee heads into its final month of negotiations, often conducted in secret, they’ve felt the full force of Washington’s special interest machine.
According to Politico, the super committee has been lobbied by almost 200 special interest groups and companies seeking to influence the panel’s budget-slashing prescriptions. Those interests include everyone from American Indian tribes and the airline industry to powerful health insurance companies such as WellPoint.
This lobbying onslaught is, in part, an attempt to pierce the layer of secrecy surrounding the super committee, which often meets behind closed doors and has kept the public mostly in the dark about any potential agreements or breakthroughs. Here’s Politico:
For good government and transparency advocates, the activities of the super committee and its members have been a worry since the committee emerged out of the debt ceiling deal forged between the White House and Congressional leaders this summer. In mid-September, 14 different groups—such as the Brennan Center for Justice, Common Cause, Public Citizen, and the Sunlight Foundation—urged the members of the supercommittee to disclose all meetings with and donations from lobbyists during their time on the supercommittee. Failing to do so “will reinforce the public’s mistrust of the deficit reduction process and risk delegitimizing the Committee’s work,” the groups wrote to members of the committee. Several members of Congress also introduced legislation to force super committee members to disclose donations they receive while on the committee, but those efforts failed to gain any traction.
At least one lawmaker agreed with the advocates and concerned lawmakers. Last month, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) said he would not raise any money during his time on the super committee, canceling all fundraisers between September and Nov. 23.

Montana GOP state Rep. Krayton Kerns is taking criticism for comments he made earlier this month comparing Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke to a studding English bulldog named “John-Boy.” Yes, really.
In mid-March, Kerns, a veterinarian from the ranching town of Laurel, posted an entry to his personal blog, “Ramblings of a Conservative Cow Doctor,” in which he mused about the irony of freedom-loving Americans being “screwed” by the debate over access to birth control. Why, Kerns wondered, are we spending so much time talking about “contraception for coeds”? On Monday, Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Stacey Anderson told the Missoulian Kerns’ post was “degrading, sexist and inexcusable.”
Anderson was referring to this passage:
This is of course a misunderstanding of the concept of health insurance, which is not charity, but rather something that you pay into in exchange for coverage. It’s also not an accurate depiction of Sandra Fluke, who is a thirty-year-old third-year law student, not an undergraduate “coed.” Nor does it appear that Kerns actually read Fluke’s testimony, which focused not on her sex life, but on one of her lesbian classmates who has a medical condition that made birth control a necessity. Also: What does a studding bulldog have to do with anything?
But at least Kerns understands that the cost of birth control doesn’t hinge on how much sex you have—which is more than you can say for Rush Limbaugh.

Today, the Secret Service confirmed that it will interview right-wing shock rocker Ted Nugent in connection with his comments at last week’s National Rifle Association convention in St. Louis.
This does not appear to be the first time that the Secret Service has expressed an interest in the Nuge. At the NRA’s 2005 conference in Houston, I witnessed Nugent bragging about getting harassed by President George W. Bush’s security detail. “I kept getting these phone calls from the Secret Service,” he said, wearing fatigues and standing in front of a “Don’t Tread On Me” banner on a small stage. “And I’m like, ‘Oh shit, what do I do now?'” He recounted that Secret Service agents eventually showed up at a BBQ at his ranch near Crawford, Texas. Nugent thought it was a raid. “I was running around,” he recalled. “I thought there was going to be a couple of guys pulling into the BBQ and shooting.”
Nugent expressed no qualms about engaging in a gun battle with the heavily-armed agents. “I said, ‘I’ve got a bunch of guys with McMillan assault rifles trained on the back of your head, so if this is a raid, you can just turn right back around.'”
But it turned out that the Secret Service had just stopped by to play target practice. Nugent said he set up bowling pins a few hundred feet away and took aim with a borrowed government rifle and pretended to shoot the director of Bowling for Columbine. “Before I shot, I went, ‘In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.’ Michael Moore! And I blew him up. Beautiful!”
It’s unclear whether Nugent had exaggerated or fabricated parts of this story, though the part about the Secret Service showing up at his ranch near Crawford seems plausible, given that George W. Bush often vacationed at his own ranch nearby. The Secret Service could not immediately be reached for comment.
“If Barack Obama becomes the president in November, again, I will be either dead or in jail by this time next year,” Nugent said at last weekend’s NRA convention. Or maybe he’ll end up shooting off a few more rounds with the feds.

As it became obvious on Tuesday evening that Thomas Massie was going to win the GOP primary in Kentucky’s 4th congressional district, Trey Grayson hopped on Twitter to explain just why this story sounded so familiar: “Have to admit that I chuckled when someone called Massie’s performance so far tonight a #Randslide. Pretty apt description. I should know!”
He should. Two years ago, the only thing standing between Grayson, the GOP’s handpicked replacement for retiring Sen. Jim Bunning, and the Republican Senate nomination was a Bowling Green optometrist with no political experience. Grayson lost to Rand Paul by twenty points. On Tuesday, in the 4th district, it happened again. State Sen. Alecia Webb-Edgington had the support of retiring Rep. Geoff Davis and Bunning, who held the seat previously. County executive Thomas Massie, with Rand Paul’s backing, won by 16 points. Randslide indeed.
(More evidence of Paul’s coattails: Former spokesman Chris Hightower, last seen resigning from Paul’s senate campaign after being outed as a Satanic death-metal drummer, won the GOP primary for a seat in the Kentucky state house on Tuesday.)
Massie had help, though. Liberty for All, a Texas-based super-PAC founded by John Ramsey, a 21-year-old Ron Paul-loving college kid (you can read my profile of Ramsey here) paid for a $550,000 advertising barrage over the final 10 days of the campaign. Funded, at least for now, with money Ramsey inherited from his late grandfather, Liberty for All wants to provide a party framework for “Freedom candidates”—that is, provide the kind of institutional support and training for Paul-ish candidates that establishment pols already get from party organs. Preston Bates, the group’s executive director, estimated that they’d end up spending $700,000 on the Massie race if you factor in direct mail and man hours. That’s a lot, especially when you consider that Webb-Edgington, the second-place finisher, had raised just $200,000 by May 2.
Whether or not Ramsey, Bates, et al. can take their project to scale remains to be seen, but the race offers a glimpse of the future landscape of campaign finance. As Grayson, now director of the Harvard Institute of Politics, put it: “Expect to see more Super PACs getting involved in Congressional & other ‘smaller’ races where six figure donations can tilt an election.”
If presidential candidates can each have their own corresponding billionaires, why wouldn’t House candidates have their own patrons too?

Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia’s crusading GOP attorney general, has refused to certify regulations from the Virginia Board of Health that would allow existing abortion clinics in the state to stay open.
The Virginia legislature passed a strict new set of rules in August 2011 that threatened to shut down a number of clinics in the state. The rules would force clinics that provide abortions to meet the standards of outpatient surgical centers—including specific requirements about the size of the rooms; the width of the hallways; the location of the bathrooms; the specifications of the heating, ventilation, air conditioning systems; and the number of parking spaces. Reproductive rights groups say that most of the 23 clinics offering abortions in the state would likely be unable to meet all the new standards unless they found new facilities or made major changes to their current ones.
After nine hours of debate and a large protest, the Virginia Board of Health voted in June to amend the regulations to grandfather-in existing clinics, allowing the current offices to stay open. But now Cuccinelli is blocking the Board of Health’s decision, arguing that the board “exceeded its authority” in amending the rules.
That’s an interesting argument, considering that the Board of Health exists make and enforce regulations, as well as to provide “for reasonable variances and exemptions therefrom.” Opponents of the strict abortion regulation say it’s Cuccinelli who is overstepping his authority. “The Attorney General has no basis to exert veto power over these regulations,” said ProgressVA Executive Director Anna Scholl in a statement Monday night. “In Ken Cuccinelli’s desperate crusade to regulate away reproductive health access for Virginia’s women, he’s willing to completely ignore the parameters of the Attorney General’s office.”
Meanwhile, Cuccinelli’s boss and the guy whose job he’d like to have after the 2013 election, Gov. Bob McDonnell, last week appointed a staunchly anti-abortion doctor who helped write the harsh new clinic regulations to an open seat on the Board of Health. Dr. John W. Seeds is an obstetrician at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center and the vice chairman of Virginia OBGYNS For Life, and has written for the Virginia Christian Alliance about how “Abortion is the voluntary killing of a human life that requires, in my opinion, turning away from God and his love,” the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports.
This latest appointment has abortion rights groups worried, as Cuccinelli’s move means that the regulations will likely end up back before a board that is now even more anti-abortion.

Update, 8/7/12, 11:24 p.m.: Leading Nancy Cassis by 30 points with 72 percent of the precincts reporting, Kerry Bentivolio has claimed victory in the GOP primary. He’ll take on Democratic nominee Syed Taj in November. All told, Liberty for All spent more than $500,000 in support of Bentivolio. As the super-PAC’s executive director, Preston Bates, put it in an email: “It looks like Christmas comes in August this year…”
Everything was going was just fine for Republicans in Michigan’s 11th District until their congressman decided to run for president.
Rep. Thaddeus McCotter, a bald, pasty, self-deprecating conservative with a monotone voice and a soft spot for economic protectionism, entered the presidential race in July and left two months later after receiving 35 votes at the Ames Straw Poll and one very bad case of midlife crisis. He coped by pouring his energies into writing a sitcom about his life that costarred an Asian sidekick whose catchphrase is “I’m Thai!” Thus distracted, McCotter failed to collect enough valid signatures to appear on the primary ballot, came under investigation for fraud, and in early June, citing a litany of “calumnies, indignities, and deceits,” abruptly resigned.
The ensuing vacuum has turned an otherwise anonymous House race into one of the oddest—and most vicious—GOP primaries of 2012. With the August 7th primary four days away, the only Republican on the ballot is Kerry Bentivolio, a reindeer rancher, Santa impersonator, and political novice who once starred in a low-budget movie suggesting that 9/11 was an inside job. A second candidate, Nancy Cassis, is spending $200,000 of her own money on a scorched-earth write-in campaign (“Nothing Fancy, Write-In Nancy“). And in just the last week, Liberty for All, a pro-Ron Paul super-PAC financed by a 21-year-old college kid from Texas, has injected hundreds of thousands into the race with an eye toward tipping the scales.
On one level, the race represents a choice between the Republican establishment and the burgeoning wing of Ron Paul-inspired libertarian-minded activists. Bentivolio, who has been endorsed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and his acolyte, Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), is a proponent of “sound money,” a critic of the Federal Reserve, and a skeptic when it comes to domestic surveillance and overseas entanglements. A veteran of the Iraq war, Bentivolio now teaches high school English and runs Old Fashioned Santa and Company, which provides reindeer and a Saint Nick look-alike (Bentivolio) for holiday parades and tree lighting ceremonies. As the campaign proudly notes, “They also maintain a small flock of chickens, a 25-hive apiary of honeybees, and a 115-vine vineyard.”
Bentivolio was an also-ran in the primary until May, when McCotter failed to qualify for the ballot, leaving the GOP establishment scrambling for a viable replacement. They settled on Cassis, an influential state senator who had run unsuccessfully for governor and 2006 and had the resources to overcome a likely fundraising shortfall. Now Cassis has to take out Santa.
Cassis’ harshest criticism of Bentivolio has centered on her opponent’s appearance in a 2011 film called The President Goes to Heaven. Bentivolio plays the head doctor in the film, which centers around a president, modeled closely on George W. Bush, who is forced to account for his actions in Washington as he lies dying in a hospital. The movie is a crude, failed attempt at satire. In one scene, the actors discuss how the “1/11 attacks” were orchestrated by the vice president, “Dick,” in order to advance his own Middle Eastern oil interests. Elsewhere the movie serves mostly to let actors vent their anger.
Oscar bait, it is not. “You were more powerful than God,” a nurse tells the president, who is lying in a hospital bed with his own feces. “Do you remember those people jumping from the tower? All those people, standing on the ledges of the 84th floor, waving for help? Do you remember all the men in uniform you sent to Afghanistan to die?” She adds: “You were just the most powerful man on earth and now you’ve pooped your pants.”
The Cassis campaign posted a three-minute low-light reel from the film to YouTube and cut a 30-second ad attacking it as “sickening.” Cassis has vowed not to support her opponent if he wins on Tuesday, citing the movie. Bentivolio told the Detroit News that he had done the film for research purposes. “All I wanted to do was feel more comfortable in front of a camera and research film subsidies,” he said.
Coupled with Cassis’ massive cash advantage (Bentivolio barely had enough money for one ad buy), that would normally be the nail in the coffin for the Paulite. In the only poll of the race, released on Wednesday, Cassis led Bentivolio by 16 points, 52 to 36. But Cassis’ lead is shakier than it looks, because her name won’t appear anywhere on the ballot. In a close election, that could make all the difference.
The other X-factor is more conventional. Late last month, Liberty for All, the libertarian-minded super-PAC funded by 21-year-old Texas college student John Ramsey, began flooding the district with direct mail, robocalls, and television ads in support of Bentivolio. Liberty for All rose to prominence in May, when it poured $800,000 into a Kentucky race on behalf of another Rand Paul-backed candidate, Thomas Massie, who won easily. This time around, given the strength of the candidate and the short time frame, that money could be even more significant. By election day, Liberty for All will have spent $300,000 on advertising alone, according to the Detroit Free Press—10 times more than Bentivolio spent in the first six and a half months of the campaign. It’s 50 percent more than Cassis has pledged to her own campaign. Reached by phone on Thursday, the PAC’s executive director, Preston Bates, said he couldn’t talk because he was at the bank completing a wire transfer.
It’s a script so weird Thaddeus McCotter could have written it.

Ballot question 1 passed with 73 percent of the vote. Rob Richie, the president of FairVote, a RCV advocacy group, called it a “tremendous victory for local reformers” and said “New York City voters showed confidence in growing evidence that ranked choice voting can strengthen local democracy.”
In today’s election, New York City is considering adopting ranked-choice voting. If passed, it will be the largest municipality to adopt the innovate voting process.
Ranked-choice voting is basically an “instant runoff”: Voters not only vote for one candidate but rank their preferences. New York City’s version of RCV would, for example, allow voters to rank five candidates for mayor. If one candidate wins a majority of first preference choices, they’re elected. If not, the person with the fewest first choice votes is eliminated. Then the votes for the now-eliminated candidate get redistributed to the voters’ second preferred choice. This continues until one candidate has a majority.

In the current system, “you’ve got real vote-splitting problems, you got the spoiler scenario,” Steven Mulroy, a University of Memphis law professor who wrote a book on RCV, tells me. Imagine, as the New York Times editorial board did in endorsing the measure, the following situation:
(Just to keep on New York Media, on the always-fun tabloid side, the New York Daily News has warring op-eds on ranked-choice voting.)
This spoiler scenario leads to people not voting their real preferences, Mulroy argues. “How many of us have heard someone say, ‘A vote for Jill Stein is really a vote for Trump?'” By allowing for preferences, a voter can choose not only their optimal candidate but ensure voting for someone who may not win wouldn’t help someone they hate.
Labeled Question 1, the ballot measure could overhaul the election system ahead of the 2021 mayoral elections. It would apply to city-wide elections like city council, comptroller, and public advocate, too. Michael Douglas has lent his face to the campaign, advocating for a yes vote on the ballot measure in a series of videos for Rank The Vote NYC. (I thought “Longball” was his best work among the batch, but my second preference would be “Reform” and my third would be “Pithy.”)
Another key aspect of ranked-choice is that it eliminates runoffs, which typically have low turnout. FairVote, an advocacy organization for fair elections that supports RCV, points out that in 96.5 percent of 171 congressional runoff elections between 1994 and 2012, fewer people voted than in the general. “The problem is if you make people go to the polls over and over again, then you end up having a real low voter turnout,” Mulroy says. Runoffs have long led to lower turnout on the state level, too. What’s more, RCV could save money for localities; a mayoral runoff in Phoneix, Arizona, for instance, cost a million dollars.
Studies have shown myriad of other benefits: RCV could help tone down campaigns based on attacking opponents (if you want the other candidate’s base to put you second, you won’t throw mud). And FairVote argues RCV leads to a more representative government—boosting officials of color and women.
On the other side, RCV has been called confusing. Researchers have documented “ballot exhaustion” in which voters did not fully rank preferences, and as a result the elected official did not receive the majority of the votes cast. Plus, the tabulating of several preferences could be more costly than the traditional calculation of ballots.
New York City would follow a dozen-plus other municipalities, as well as the state of Maine, in adopting RCV, and could be a model for some of the country’s largest cities to follow. But the fight over RCV may not end with the ballot on Tuesday. Maine voted on RCV back in 2016, but it only recently fully approved it for presidential elections. The measure was challenged in court and had to go back before the legislature. “Where it gets adopted, at first there is massive resistance by the incumbent power structure,” Mulroy says. “People in power like the system that brought them to power.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

According to projections, Democratic candidates have won enough seats in the state Senate and the House of Delegates for majority control of the state’s legislature.
Virginia’s off-off-year state elections drew an unprecedented amount of national attention—and money—as Democratic fundraisers and national progressive groups seized upon the opportunity to flip the Virginia legislature. After the gains Democrats made in the state in 2017, Republicans held only a slim majority in both the state Senate and House. And, thanks to redrawn district maps that favored Democrats in several key districts, that majority was under serious threat, even after a trio of scandals involving the state’s Democratic governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general.
Democrats needed only one seat to flip the state’s Senate, which they clinched with John Bell defeating Geary Higgins in District 13, a seat vacated by the retiring Sen. Richard H. Black. In the state’s House of Delegates, Democrats won the three they needed to gain control, with wins in District 76, where Clinton Jenkins defeated the incumbent Chris Jones, as well as in District 94, where Shelly Simonds—who lost in 2017 in race that was decided by a coin flip—defeated incumbent David Yancey.
The debate over strengthening the state’s gun control laws was at the center of Virginia’s elections. In the wake of the mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May, in which a disgruntled city employee entered a municipal building and killed 12 people, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam convened a special legislative session for the sole purpose of passing new gun control measures. But the GOP majority, led by House Speaker Kirk Cox, voted to end the session after just 90 minutes—without passing any bills. In the weeks leading up to the election, polls showed that gun control was the leading issue for voters, and Democrats seized on it as a central aspect of their messaging. The national gun reform group Every Town For Gun Safety and its sister organization, Moms Demand Action, spent $2.5 million to support Democratic candidates in the state.
With the Democrats now in full control of Virginia government, they are finally in a position to push forward several pieces of progressive legislation that’s been held up for years by Republicans. In addition to tougher gun regulations, Democrats hope to enact workplace and housing protections for LGBTQ residents, and a higher minimum wage.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Kamala Harris Wants to Change That.,Kara Voght,MotherJones,Politics,"The mismatch between the school day and work day presents a real burden to working Americans with families. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has a new bill that seeks to correct it.
The majority of schools days end around 3 p.m., two hours before the end of 70 percent of parents’ workdays. And most schools don’t have a way to make up the difference. Fewer than half of all elementary schools—and fewer than a third of low-income schools—offer after-school care. Beyond that misalignment, schools shut down, on average, for 29 days during the school year, the majority of which are reserved for professional development, parent-teacher conferences, and myriad vacations and minor holidays the federal government doesn’t recognize. That’s a full two weeks’ worth of days more than what the average American has in holidays, vacation, and paid leave combined. And then, of course, there’s summer vacation, a two- to three-month break that leaves working parents scrambling for day-long care.
I wrote about this phenomenon for the Atlantic last year, pointing to a series of disquieting statistics that Harris also raises in her bill, which the California senator is releasing on Wednesday. The school day and calendar is a bad deal for children: In the absence of a better alternative, 3 percent of elementary-school students and 19 percent of middle-school students look after themselves from 3 to 6 p.m. on school nights. But it’s an equally bad deal for working parents—and the economy as a whole. A family paying out of pocket to cover child care for those two hours between the end of the school and workday costs an average of $6,600 dollars per year, or nearly 10 percent of an average family’s income. Almost 40 percent of all workers lack access to any paid vacation time, which means parents will often have to scale back their workday to accommodate child care duties.
That burden typically falls to women, a million of whom work less than full-time in order to keep up with caregiving responsibilities for elementary school-aged children. This hardship is particularly pronounced for low-income mothers and mothers of color, who are the most likely to have unpredictable or inflexible work schedules. Experts estimate the United States loses $55 billion in productivity each year thanks to the public school calendar. “Seventy-five percent of mothers of school-age children are working, and we need to come to terms with this reality,” says Catherine Brown, a researcher at the liberal Center for American Progress whose findings informed much of Harris’ bill. “How could we reimagine school so it’s better for kids and better for families?”
Harris frames her proposal through that lens, with a promise that “aligning school and work schedules is an economic growth and child development strategy.” Her plan: A pilot program that gives money to 500 schools that serve a high proportion of low-income families to develop a school schedule that better matches the work schedule. Each recipient school would receive up to $5 million dollars over five years to keep their doors open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., with no closures except for weekends, federal holidays, and emergencies. Professional development, parent-teacher conferences, and the like would have to happen, at minimum, alongside a full day of enrichment activities. At the end of the five years, the Education Department would publish a report documenting the best practices, as well as changes in parental employment, student performance, and teacher retention rates to be used to inform a future broader program.
“My mother raised my sister and me while working demanding, long hours,” Harris says. “So, I know firsthand that, for many working parents, juggling between school schedules and work schedule is a common cause of stress and financial hardship. But, this does not have to be the case.”
Schools are encouraged to use the funding to collaborate with community partners to develop “high-quality, culturally relevant, linguistically accessible, developmentally appropriate academic, athletic, or enrichment opportunities for students.” The directive is purposefully vague: Schools are to spend the first year surveying parents, teachers, and community members to determine what sort of extended school day would work best for their particular school population. “What’s exciting about this is that it’s an innovation bill,” Brown explains of Harris’ design. “We don’t have the solutions yet, but they’re going to come from local communities that know what works best for their parents and students.”
The bill would also require the school to find a private or non-federal public funding source, such as state grants or philanthropy organizations, to match 10 percent of the federal grant money, a stipulation intended to help the programs remain sustainable after the initial grant money has run out. The matches can be money or an in-kind contribution in the form of volunteer staff time, meeting spaces, or equipment.
Those in-kind contributions of staff time might be critical to her plans’ success. Harris’ plan takes pains to ensure school staff wouldn’t be overburdened by her vision, a key concession in an environment in which teachers have taken to the picket lines to protest long hours and low pay. Teachers and administrators would not increase the amount of time they work unless they volunteer additional hours and are compensated fairly for them. “This could be a real win for teachers,” Brown explains, noting that an extended schedule would give schools the chance to get creative about who has responsibility for students throughout the day. “It shifts the mindset from one teacher being responsible for a group of kids all day to the school and community collectively watching students.”
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the country’s largest teachers unions, supports the measure. “This bill would enable school districts and communities to find solutions that work for them,” she said in a statement, while ensuring “teachers and paraprofessionals aren’t filling in the gaps without respect and fair compensation.”
Harris’ plan offers specificity around a concern that her fellow 2020 Democratic contenders have gestured at, but without Harris’ level of specificity. A number of other candidates have advocated for a “community school” model that would provide extended learning time and after-school programs in addition to other social services, such as health and dental care. Bernie Sanders’ K-12 education plan calls for $5 billion in annual funding to support these types of schools, Elizabeth Warren’s plan promises to transition 25,000 schools onto that model by 2030, and former Housing and Urban Development secretary and 2020 hopeful Julián Castro has an eight-year plan to extend community schools into high-need communities.
Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), and former 2020 hopeful Kristen Gillibrand (N.Y.) are joining Harris as cosponsors on the bill. Of her fellow Senate Democrats who are also seeking the presidency—Sens. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Sanders, and Warren—only Bennet has signed on.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

How much will it cost? Where will the money go? Which regions require the most aid? These are questions that politicians across the political spectrum will need to answer when it comes to climate change, one of the most defining issues not only for the 2020 election but for the future of the planet.
That’s why the Weather Channel, Mother Jones, and Climate Desk have teamed up: to have thoughtful conversations with 2020 hopefuls from both parties, to see up close places across the country that have been affected by extreme weather, and to discuss policy proposals and personal insights about the climate crisis. The result is a one-hour special, “2020: Race to Save the Planet,” which airs on Thursday, November 7 at 8 pm ET.  The Weather Channel’s hurricane expert and broadcast meteorologist Dr. Rick Knabb will host the segment, which will feature five Democrats and three Republicans.
Times have dramatically changed since the last presidential election, when climate change took a back seat to issues like the economy and immigration. But rising awareness of the dangers of climate change combined with heightened concern about the rollbacks of environmental protections under President Donald Trump has turned addressing a warming planet into a top issue for voters in 2020.
“It was so frustrating to cover the 2016 cycle and just wait around hoping candidates would talk about climate change in the debates—and that discussion barely happened,” says Mother Jones environment reporter Rebecca Leber. “Now, we’re in a completely different cycle where everyone has a plan, or multiple plans, to tackle this.”
In this week’s episode of the Mother Jones Podcast, host Jamilah King sits down with Dr. Knabb and Leber to discuss some of the differences among the plans from Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Mark Sanford, and others: How do they intend to support frontline communities and invest in infrastructure? How much will their plans will cost? And how has their own awakening to the importance of the issue taken place?


“This special is really not intended to be partisan at all,” says Dr. Knabb. “It’s really intended to allow candidates from both sides to get their side of the issue out there.”
The candidates acknowledge we’re in a crucial moment—as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said, “like the moon landing, or the Manhattan Project…this is certainly as urgent, as pressing, as any of those things we’ve taken on before”—but they all have different approaches. Understanding these differences will be crucial to voters who want to go to the polls and make an informed choice. Tune into the podcast for highlights straight from the special, join the discussion on social media with #RaceToSaveThePlanet, and ask Dr. Knabb a question after the podcast on a streaming show on Pattrn.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Sure, Trump was holding up military aid, and sure, Trump was balking at a meeting with Ukraine’s new president, and sure, Trump wanted Ukraine’s president to open an investigation into Joe Biden. But that was all just a big coincidence.
A week later, Bill Taylor, a professional diplomat who is our actual acting ambassador to Ukraine, testified quite differently. He testified that there was indeed a quid pro quo; Sondland knew all about it; and Taylor himself thought it was nuts.
Faced with this, Sondland had a choice to make. Fess up or risk going to prison for perjury? Today he decided that discretion was the better part of valor and submitted a revised and extended version of his remarks to Congress:
Unless my memory is playing tricks on me, this is the first time that Pence has been explicitly tied to the quid pro quo. Pence’s previous testimony has been the usual favorite of VPs throughout history: he was out of the loop and knew nothing. But if Sondland is to be believed, that’s not true.
So now it looks like pretty much everyone knew about Trump’s extortion of Ukraine. He wanted President Zelensky to get in front of a microphone and announce in no uncertain terms that a probe of the Bidens was being re-opened. Once that was done, the money spigot would flow and the doors of the White House would be thrown open.
And once again for the slow learners: Trump was doing this not in exchange for some kind of US benefit. He was doing it specifically for personal gain in an upcoming election.
But Republicans continue to pretend that this is no big deal because they’re afraid of what Trump’s base might do to them if they admitted that this was, in fact, a serious abuse of power. And so nothing happens.
POSTSCRIPT: As I was telling someone last night, this is why I’m perfectly happy for the impeachment probe to go on forever. I don’t think it ruins the Democratic primaries at all, but every week brings new revelations and you never know when someone is accidentally going to let slip something that’s a brand new surprise. I would personally be delighted if the Senate were voting on impeachment next Halloween.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

While Trump and his defenders have claimed there was no shifty quid pro quo in his dealings with Ukraine, all the evidence indicates there was. And the just-released congressional testimony of Ambassador Gordon Sondland, the hotel magnate whose $1 million donation to Trump’s inauguration won him a job as a diplomat, shows that Trump essentially ordered a shakedown of Ukraine and placed his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in charge of this caper. Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, who worked with Sondland and Giuliani in pursuit of Trump’s political objectives in Ukraine, also fingered Giuliani as the mastermind of this effort in his deposition, which was released on Tuesday.
Sondland, it seems, had trouble recalling all the details of this scheme when he testified; he subsequently amended his testimony after other witnesses told the House committees conducting an impeachment inquiry that Trump had withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to muscle Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky to produce political dirt useful for Trump. But in his original testimony, Sondland did detail clearly the Trump-Giuliani plot to abuse the office of the president. And it’s all damn simple.
In his testimony, Sondland described what is now a familiar set of facts. On May 20, he attended the inauguration of Zelensky as part of an American delegation that included Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), and Alex Vindman, a Ukraine expert at the National Security Council. They all came away believing Zelensky was a swell fellow and that Washington should move quickly to strengthen its relationship with him. Three days later, they briefed Trump and suggested that he first hold a phone conversation with Zelensky and then a White House visit with the Ukrainian—moves that the Ukrainians deeply desired. (After all, Ukraine was—and still is—engaged in a war with Russia, which has seized portions of the country, and buttressing the bonds between Ukraine and the United States was a top priority for Kiev.)  Trump, though, was not eager for this, Sondland testified. “He just kept saying: ‘Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy,'” Sondland said.
This was something of a WTF moment for Sondland and the other officials. Why was Giuliani involved at all? Sondland testified that he and the rest were “disappointed by the President’s direction that we involve Mr. Giluliani. Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President’s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.” But, Sondland said, they were faced with a choice: “We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U. S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region, or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President’s concerns.” So they decided to talk to Trump’s top henchman.
When Sondland checked in with Giuliani, he testified, “Giuliani emphasized that the President wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into anti-corruption issues” and “specifically mentioned the 2016 election, including the DNC server, and Burisma as two anti corruption investigatory topics of importance for the President.”
Freeze the frame: top US officials want to help Ukraine win phone and face time with Trump; Trump essentially says, you gotta talk to Rudy first; and Giuliani says no meeting without Zelensky launching an investigations to produce material that supports a crazy conspiracy theory that holds the Russians did not hack the Democrats during the 2016 election and to uncover information on a company whose board included former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.
This is all happening months before Trump orders the withholding of military funding for Ukraine. But it’s a straightforward message from Trump: the United States will not build a productive relationship with Zelensky unless he does what Giuliani demands—and this demand has nothing to do with foreign policy or with corruption in Ukraine.  Giuliani, as Sondland described it, was Trump’s bag man, as the quid pro quo—or call it extortion—plot was hatched. “The key to changing the President’s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,” Sondland testified.
Sondland and Volker’s overlapping testimony that they took direction from Giuliani because Trump ordered them to do so obliterates Giuliani’s claim that he was no rogue player and was acting at the State Department’s behest. That’s been his cover story: it was all on the up and up because Foggy Bottom asked me to get involved in this Ukrainian business. In late September, the former New York City mayor cited text messages from Volker in asserting that he had not improperly interfered with US foreign policy. “If State was so upset and nervous about me why would they ask me to meet with [Andriy Yermak, a Zelensky deputy]?” he wrote in a text message to Mother Jones.
Asked if he thought the officials had come to him on their own accord or at Trump’s command, Giuliani wrote, “Since they presented it to me, it seemed like it was their idea. I don’t remember anything to the contrary.” Giuliani’s account is basically that he did the State Department a favor when Sondland and the others came to him for assistance. That sure is not how Sondland and Volker depicted it: Giuliani was Trump’s button man, and they were forced to deal with him.
Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Something else of interest happened at that May 23 meeting. As Sondland, Perry, and others tried to make the point that Zelensky could be a good partner for Washington, Trump kept repeating, “They tried to take me down.” This apparently was a reference to Ukrainians and the aforementioned conspiracy theory that claims Ukrainian officials helped concoct the hoax that Russia attacked the 2016 election and schemed against Trump by investigating Paul Manafort, his campaign manager (who had once made millions working as a consultant for a corrupt Ukrainian president). So not only was Trump looking to withhold US favor to force the Ukrainians to assist him politically; he was seeking vengeance. And Giuliani would be his avenging angel.
There are a lot of complications to the Trump-Ukrainian scandal. Giuliani, for example, had other interests in Ukraine that appeared to bump into those of a controversial oligarch who the Justice Department once called an upper-echelon Russian-organized crime associate (a charge the oligarch denies), and he had two business associates helping him on the Biden front who were involved in their own sketchy business dealings in Ukraine. (And these two guys just happened to be arrested recently and charged with making illegal political contributions to Republicans in the United States.) But Sondland’s testimony—even if it seems carefully designed to distance him from the most explicit aspects of the quid pro quos that occurred—is easy to follow. Trump told the professional diplomats to forget about proper channels and sent them to his freebooting lawyer for instructions, and that loyal lieutenant handed them an underhanded offer they felt they could not refuse.
Asked during his deposition if he raised concerns with anyone about Giuliani’s interference, Sondland responded, “Listen, the State Department was fully aware of the issues, and there was very little they could do about it if the President decided he wanted his lawyer involved.”
Sondland’s testimony contains no new bombshells. But his account confirms the scandal that has already been exposed: Trump designated Giuliani as the architect of this extortion racket in a crass attempt to improperly—and perhaps illegally—exploit his office for political gain. Once upon a time, Trump worked with mobsters to get his casinos going in Atlantic City. And once upon a time, Giuliani was a crusading prosecutor who successfully busted mobsters. Sondland’s testimony offers a tale of the lessons these two New Yorkers learned.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Matt Bevin.
Over his four years in office, Bevin developed a persona as the Trumpiest governor in the country. And for a time, that may have seemed like smart politics in a state exceedingly friendly to Republicans—one where President Trump won by 30 percent in 2016, and where Republicans control both arms of the state legislature. But he ended up in a tight race thanks to a political styling that has Bevin consistently ranked as one of the least popular governors in the country. He’s spent the past several years in office name-calling his political opponents, particularly singling out the state’s public school teachers for scorn. And while that bombastic style has won the support of Trump conservatives nationally, it turns out even Republican voters aren’t always thrilled to have a politician at home who picks petty fights to distract from his political troubles.
Bevin went out of his way to try and nationalize the race, and Trump himself came to Lexington for an election eve rally. “If you lose,” Trump said, “it sends a really bad message…you can’t let that happen to me.”
As I explained for Mother Jones‘ September/October issue, Bevin united opposition by calling out the state’s teachers after they protested his proposal to rollback benefits in the state’s pensions:
Bevin’s removal from office will have immediate, real-world implications. The Republican governor staked much of his campaign on his record of rolling back reproductive rights—even tweeting out that message an hour before polls closed Tuesday.

Thanks to laws signed by Bevin, Kentucky was down to just one abortion provider, EMW Women’s Surgical Center in Louisville, which has been fighting several lawsuits to stay alive. If Bevin had won reelection, the clinic might have been forced to shut down, but it is likely safe under a Beshear regime, and the state could even see other abortion providers open.
Hundred of thousands of Kentuckians will also likely see another immediate change by having their voting rights restored once Beshear takes office. As my colleague Ari Berman recently explained:
The results are also good news for residents who rely on the government for their health insurance. The state saw one of the most dramatic drops in its uninsured rate following the implementation of Obamacare. But Bevin campaigned vehemently against the law when he first ran in 2015, and as governor he has tried to impose work requirements that could kick thousands of Medicaid recipients off their health insurance. Those changes to Medicaid are currently on hold thanks to legal challenges, and it’s unlikely that a Beshear administration will keep that fight going.
Bevin refused to concede the election after all the results came in Tuesday night, and a recount appears likely.

But with several outlets calling the election for Democrats, Beshear gave a speech declaring victory.

As kids, they were thrown into “segregation academies” in the South—private all-white schools where parents could send their children to avoid the integration of public schools, and where kids were, as one put it, “conscientiously and misguidedly furnished with an unbending white universe.”
At least 3,000 of these schools opened in the South in the early 1970s. By 1975, as many as 750,000 white students were being what they thought was “educated” there. Now, graduates of those all-white schools are telling stories about the resounding racism they learned—and the decades that some have spent unlearning or trying to unlearn it. A new website, TheAcademyStories.com, is posting their stories in hopes of striking a chord with other people raised with and steeped in white supremacist ideologies who are trying to critically dismantle and understand their own hate.
“I want to gauge how the thinking bred in such a culture — growing up inside a white society that invested huge energy and money into the segregation academy’s creation — lingers inside our heads still,” wrote Ellen Ann Fentress, a longtime journalist whose writing has appeared in the New York Times, and a documentary filmmaker who is spearheading the project with support from the Mississippi Humanities Council.
Fentress told me that some graduates of the academies are opening up about their years through self-reflection, while others say they wish she and outlets like the Jackson Free Press had never shed a spotlight on the schools. “To some of them, it looks like a personal attack on parents and faculty,” said Fentress, who posted the first essays and a call for submissions last week.
“This isn’t a proud narrative, but it’s essential U.S. history that shapes how both towns and individuals live their lives now,” as well as how structures and institutions continue to operate, Fentress said. “The conversation is unsettling” but necessary.
On the website’s first day, Fentress she got half a dozen new writers. Author and journalist Kristen Green, an early contributor, wrote that her all-white Virginia academy had “normalized and centered whiteness for me in my formative years.” For decades afterward, she said, “I didn’t have the skill set to make friends with people who looked different than me, to report knowledgeable stories about people of color” as a journalist.
Some graduates, such as Jackson, Mississippi, lawyer Lynn Watkins, have spent their lives trying to fight the racial hate that created their schools. “From the tenth grade forward, I attended and ultimately graduated from a white Citizens’ Council School; at one time, it was reportedly the largest private school system in the country,” Watkins wrote, describing her eventual work in journalism and law to expose the very systems she grew up benefitting from. “Later, as a journalist and later still as a lawyer, I learned the real lessons of history.”
Here are more Recharge stories to get you through the week:
Pen pals: A letter means a lot. That was the message that Army Brig. General Vincent Buggs gave a group of high school seniors in Stillmore, Georgia, who had exchanged letters with him when he was fighting in Iraq in 2007—and they were kindergartners. The kids had also sent him a toy gingerbread man, and Buggs sent back photos of the toy in different situations, creating a story about the gingerbread man in Iraq. Last month, Buggs got to meet and properly thank the students. “I needed to tell them how much they meant to me.” As he wrote earlier to the local paper, “The simplest gestures in life often have the greatest impacts.” (New York Times)
Postal heroes. One mail carrier stopped a home from burning. One saved an injured beagle from being mauled by a pit bull. Another encountered a 16-year-old girl who had just escaped from men who had kidnapped her for three months. (That postal worker helped her call her mother, who called 911, and stayed with the teen until police arrived.) All were honored last week by the National Association of Letter Carriers. Theresa Jo Belkota, a carrier in Buffalo, New York, who saved an injured boy’s life, reflected the graciousness of the honorees. “I’m just so happy,” she said, “to have this job.” (Washington Post)
Book heaven. Literacy, kindness, and a shared purpose have propelled Finland in the past few decades. Helsinki’s soaring state-of-the-art library has ignited national pride and brought citizens together. Two-thirds of the capital’s residents visited it within a month after its opening in December. The three-story library was designed to reinforce community trust, said Tommi Laitio, Helsinki’s executive director for culture and leisure. “This progress from one of the poorest countries of Europe to one of the most prosperous has not been an accident,” Laitio said. “It’s based on this idea that when there are so few of us—only 5.5 million people—everyone has to live up to their full potential.” (City Lab)
Follow-up. We wrote two weeks ago about a highway marker honoring Emmett Till. Another highway marker to another civil rights icon is being unveiled this Saturday in Gretna, Louisiana. In 1948, 44-year-old Royal Cyril Brooks was killed by a white police officer after Brooks offered to help exchange fares with a bus passenger who’d mistakenly paid to enter the wrong bus and wanted off, a common courtesy among passengers. The driver called a police officer, who beat Brooks, held him at gunpoint, ordered him off the bus, and shot him. The killing prompted the formation of a civil rights legal group that helped lead to the indictment of the officer for manslaughter, but a jury would not convict him. In a successful fundraising effort this year, the Brooks family said the marker “will represent a significant part of history…and become a space for future generations to learn.” (Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project)

“To our educators, your courage to stand up and fight against all the bullying and name-calling helped galvanize our entire state,” Beshear, the son of the state’s last Democratic governor, said in his acceptance speech. (Bevin has refused to concede and on Wednesday requested a re-canvassing of the vote totals, which have Beshear winning by just over 5,000 votes.)
Teachers were everywhere on Tuesday night, scoring victories across the US map. In San Francisco, a city where teachers can barely afford to live and work on their meager salary, voters not only approved a $600 million affordable housing bond but also a measure known as Proposition E that would loosen zoning rules to develop affordable and educator housing on publicly owned property. Proposition A would let the city get millions in loans toward developing extremely low-, low-, and middle-income housing. In San Francisco, union officials say, between 300 and 700 teachers a year leave the district each year. In theory, at least, the measures could help with retention.
And in Denver, where teachers went on strike earlier this year, teachers-union–backed candidates won two seats and led a third as of Wednesday, bolstering union hopes for flipping a board that, for the past decade, has mostly been led by education reform–backed members. A shift in the board could augur a move away from controversial practices like closing under-performing schools.
The wins in San Francisco and Denver were the latest in a string of victories for teachers, who in recent years have taken to the streets to call for better working conditions and more resources. Just last week, after an 11-day strike, Chicago teachers came to an agreement with that city’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, and the district. The city agreed to dedicate $35 million toward reducing class sizes; hire hundreds of new social workers, case managers, and other support staffers throughout the district; and raise teacher pay by 16 percent over five years.
In recent years there have also been teacher work stoppages in Los Angeles and Oakland. In 2018, Kentucky educators shut schools down and demonstrated at the state capitol after Bevin bad-mouthed teachers and signed a bill that would reform state pensions—a law that was challenged and overturned in state court by Beshear and teachers unions.
Throughout the race, Beshear framed himself as the teachers’ candidate, promising raises and making education a top budget priority. He has endorsed teachers’ causes, like reducing class sizes and boosting the number of support staffers and mental health services. Bevin, on the other hand, rarely misses a chance to dump on teachers. He knocked them for using the protest as an excuse to take off work. He compared them and other state workers to drowning victims who are fighting their own rescuers. He said they and other state workers had a “thug mentality.” As a political matter, this was always a bit of a gambit—in Kentucky, schools represent a major employer in most of the state’s 120 counties.

Voters in three states chose candidates and policies that could result in expanded access to the ballot, an undoing of Republican gerrymandering efforts, and a fairer voting system.
Democrat Andy Beshear, who was elected governor of Kentucky, pledged during the campaign to issue an executive order restoring voting rights to 140,000 people convicted of nonviolent felonies in the state. Kentucky is one of only three states where people with past felony convictions cannot vote unless the governor restores their rights. As a result, 300,000 Kentucky residents—nine percent of the electorate—have been disenfranchised, including more than one in four African-Americans, the highest black felon disenfranchisement rate in the country. Beshear’s executive order could affect Mitch McConnell’s reelection bid in 2020 if newly enfranchised voters, who are disproportionately black and expected to skew Democratic, oppose the Senate majority leader.
Beshear’s election could also change representation in the state if he vetoes new redistricting maps passed by the Republican-led legislature in 2021. But elections in 2020 will determine whether the GOP has enough votes to override his veto.
In Virginia, Democrats won the state legislature, giving them one-party control of the state for the first time in a quarter of a century. Democrats could now pass major voting reforms like early voting, automatic and Election Day registration, and the automatic restoration of voting rights for ex-offenders, along with repealing the state’s restrictive voter ID law. All of these bills have already been introduced by Democrats in the legislature but blocked by Republicans.
Virginia Democrats will also control the drawing of the state’s redistricting maps in 2021. It remains to be seen whether they will support efforts to create a bipartisan redistricting commission to redraw legislative and US House maps, which passed the legislature this year but must be approved by the legislature again in 2020 and then by the voters in a ballot referendum. There’s also a chance Democrats could dismay voting rights advocates by drawing their own gerrymandered maps to replace the maps drawn by Republicans in 2011.
In New York City, voters approved ranked-choice voting for citywide primary and special elections, a system that allows voters to rank their preferences for candidates, without the fear that choosing lesser-known candidates will led to them becoming spoilers. Under ranked-choice voting, if no candidate has a majority, the last-place finisher is eliminated, and his or her votes are redistributed to the second-choice candidates of his or her supporters, and the process continues until there’s a winner. New York is now the largest jurisdiction in the country to adopt the innovative reform.
The victories for voting rights in 2019 build off the momentum from 2018, when voters in eight states approved ballot initiatives to make it easier to vote and draw fairer redistricting maps.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

House intelligence chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) announced on Wednesday that the investigation is set to hold its first open hearings next week, with three key witnesses—Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, a top State Department official—scheduled to appear before lawmakers. All three have already provided damning testimony during closed-door sessions on the efforts by the White House to conduct a backdoor policy in Ukraine. Taylor notably confirmed the “crazy” quid quo pro in the president’s ever-imploding Ukraine scandal.

Those closed-door sessions have been central to Republicans’ persistent complaints that the investigation was supposedly being carried out in secret and away from the American people, despite dozens of Republican lawmakers having access to the closed-door meetings. With the investigation now ready for prime time, Republicans are likely to readjust their clamor for more transparency. The Justice Department might consider it to be the perfect time to deflect some of the attention and release its long-awaited inspector general report on the early days of the Russia investigation.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The measure was initially backed by Juul, and though the company withdrew its support in the fall, the vote marked a major blow for the company in its own backyard.
The ballot proposition centered on a measure, passed by the city in June, that banned e-cigarettes, pending FDA approval of the product. Shortly afterward Juul, the nearly $40-million vaping company headquartered here, began pushing Proposition C, which would’ve overturned the ban but was advertised as a set of regulations to enforce the vaping age of 21. As I reported, this kind of thing is a common tactic, taken straight from big tobacco:
Juul ended up putting $11 million into the campaign for Prop C, according to the San Francisco Examiner. But it dropped its support in late September under a new CEO—and a little more than a week after the FDA announced it was investigating Juul’s claims that its product is healthier than traditional cigarettes. (Michael Bloomberg spent heavily to defeat the measure.) The move was part of a larger reassessment within Juul, as journalists and activists have increasingly criticized the company. In mid-October, the company also announced it would stop selling any “non-tobacco, non-menthol-based flavors in the US.” (At the national level, in early September, the Trump administration announced an upcoming ban on flavored e-cigarettes. The policy has not been released yet, but Axios reported earlier this week the administration will likely still allow tobacco and menthol flavors.)
The e-cigarette company has lobbied hard to help craft its own regulation and shape the narrative of e-cigarettes as a cessation or switching product, painting traditional cigarettes as the real enemy. As I wrote:

Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) has endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president.
Calling the election “a fight for the very soul of our nation,” Pressley announced her support for the Massachusetts senator in a video Wednesday.

Speculation that Pressley would endorse Warren has been looming since she conspicuously failed to join Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.)—her closest political allies in the House—in endorsing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Pressley, the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, could help Warren in the Democratic primary amid increasing attacks from her rivals, notably Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Biden blogged on Medium that Warren was elitist and took a swipe at her for once being a registered Republican. Buttigieg has made headlines for attacking the senator’s Medicare for All plan.
Support from Pressley, whose 2018 grassroots campaign upended a Democratic incumbent, could also ease concerns that Warren isn’t engaging black voters.
“Elizabeth listens to the voices of community; in church basements and in packed gymnasiums, she has heard the stories of families who are struggling, and she has responded with activism, visionary policies, and community-led plans,” said Pressley in her announcement. “I’m proud to call her my senator.

https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/stone-trial-opens-with-information-indicating-donald-trump-may-have-lied-to-robert-mueller/,2019-11-06,,,politics,"November 6, 2019",Stone Trial Opens With Information Indicating Donald Trump May Have Lied to Robert Mueller,"Dan Friedman,David Corn",MotherJones,Donald Trump,"Roger Stone is on trial, and the proceedings are bad news for President Donald Trump, with federal prosecutors citing evidence that suggests Trump might have lied to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. And that sort of lying can be a crime.
The trial kicked off on Wednesday at a federal courthouse in Washington, DC, with a bit of a circus atmosphere. The neo-fascist Proud Boys were there, as well as other luminaries of the alt-right, to support Stone, the dirty trickster and conspiracy theorist who has been a Trump adviser since the 1980s. Facing seven felony counts, Stone is charged with lying repeatedly to the House Intelligence Committee, obstructing justice, and witness tampering. But this case goes beyond Stone’s alleged lies: prosecutors have revealed new information about how Trump tried to benefit from the Russian operation during the 2016 campaign that hacked the Democratic National Committee’s servers. And they are producing material undercutting Trump’s claim to Mueller that he has no recollection of talking to Stone during the campaign about WikiLeaks. This information also presents a new wrinkle in the Trump-Russia scandal: Trump might have thought in 2016 that his campaign, in effect, was colluding with WikiLeaks. That’s because the campaign was communicating with Stone about WikiLeaks’ plans and intentions and campaign officials (and perhaps Trump) believed Stone was in contact with WikiLeaks.
“The evidence in this case will show that Roger Stone lied to the House Intelligence Committee because the truth looked bad,” lead prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky said in his opening statement on Wednesday. “The truth looked bad for the Trump campaign and the truth looked bad for Donald Trump.”
One of the key points Mueller investigated was whether the Trump campaign had interacted with WikiLeaks or Russian intermediaries in 2016 when Moscow was using WikiLeaks for its operation to subvert the US presidential campaign (which was mounted in part to help Trump win). Trump refused to be questioned in person by Mueller and his investigators. Instead, he agreed to answer written questions on a limited number of subjects. Several of the queries Mueller submitted to Trump focused on whether he was ever told Stone had been in touch with WikiLeaks and whether he or anyone associated with his campaign had spoken to Stone about WikiLeaks. In his written response, Trump replied, “I do not recall being told during the campaign that Roger Stone or anyone associated with my campaign had discussions with any of the entities named in the question regarding the content or timing of release of hacked emails.” He also noted, “I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with [Stone], nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign.” And Trump, who has boasted of possessing a prodigious memory, claimed to have “no recollection of the specifics of any conversations I had with Mr. Stone between June 1, 2016” and Election Day. The impression Trump provided: as far as he knew, he and his campaign had had nothing to do with Stone and WikiLeaks.
Mueller’s report characterized Trump’s responses as “inadequate.” Zelinsky’s opening statement suggests Stone’s trial could show Trump’s statements were false.
On June 14, 2016, the Washington Post reported that the DNC had been hacked by Russia. On that same day, Zelinsky said, Stone, an unofficial campaign adviser, spoke by phone with Trump. Zelinsky also cited another suspicious call. This occurred on July 31, 2016—not too long after WikiLeaks had at the start of the Democrats’ convention released thousands of DNC emails and documents stolen by the Russians. Stone phoned Trump and the two men spoke for about 10 minutes. Prosecutors don’t know what the men discussed, according to Zelinsky, but about an hour later, Stone emailed Jerome Corsi, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who was helping Stone’s efforts to attack Hillary Clinton. Stone instructed Corsi to travel to London and “get to” Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who was holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy to avoid arrest by British authorities.
Corsi has since claimed that he did not speak to Assange or anyone connected to WikiLeaks. Yet on August 2, Corsi emailed Stone, “Word is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps. One shortly after I’m back. 2nd in Oct. Impact planned to be very damaging.” The next day, Stone emailed his former lobbying partner Paul Manafort, who at this point was the Trump campaign’s chairman. Stone, according to Zelinsky, told Manafort he had an idea “to save Trump’s ass,” and he asked Manafort to call him.
Stone later emailed Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, who joined the Trump campaign after Manafort’s mid-August ouster, and asserted that time was running out for Trump to salvage his candidacy. Stone said in this message, sent on August 18, that he knew how to win the election “but it ain’t pretty.” Bannon wrote back, in part: Let’s talk ASAP.” Zelinsky told the court that Bannon will testify that he and Stone “had been talking all summer long” about WikiLeaks and that Stone had told Bannon what he had been claiming publicly: that he had inside information on WikiLeaks. (Stone now insists he had been lying and possessed no inside connection to WikiLeaks.) In October 2016, when Assange gave a bizarre press conference widely seen as a dud because he did not disclose new material on Hillary Clinton, Bannon immediately emailed Stone to ask, “What was that?” Stone assured Bannon that Assange still planned to release additional emails. And days later, WikiLeaks began releasing messages the Russians had swiped from Clinton campaign chief John Podesta. Trump touted those releases extensively in the final weeks of campaign, declaring, “I love WikiLeaks.”
The story that Zelinsky began telling at the start of the trial raised the possibility (or probability) that Trump and his campaign did interact with Stone regarding the WikiLeaks releases of stolen Democratic documents—and that they considered Stone a backchannel to Assange and his organization. (It remains an open question whether Stone had indeed obtained inside information on WikiLeak’s plans. Stone’s lawyers argued Wednesday that he only was sharing information that was already public.) Yet Trump told Mueller he had no memory of him or anyone else connected to his campaign communicating with Stone about WikiLeaks. That seems hard to believe. Lying to Mueller could be a crime—similar to the crime that Stone has been charged with. And though Mueller noted in his final report that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted on a federal charge, he did indicate that a president could be prosecuted once he or she leaves office.
The Stone trial is expected to last several days, and it may well continue to produce information that, as Zelinsky said, looks “bad for Donald Trump.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The rule, which was set to go into effect later this month, was voided by US District Court Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan. In a 147-page opinion, Engelmayer stated that the administration did not have the authority to enact major portions of the rule change and that several parts of the Department of Health and Human Services’ argument in favor of the change were factually inaccurate.
Had the rule, also known as the refusal-of-care rule, gone into effect, it would have enabled providers, pharmacists, and potentially employers to deny health care services, information, or referrals to patients on moral or religious grounds, even in emergencies. Hospitals that forced their employees to provide care over their personal objections would have been subject to penalties such as losing federal funding. The rule would also have allowed providers to decline to refer a patient to another provider in order to receive care based on personal objections to the service.
The lawsuit that resulted in Wednesday’s ruling was brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, nearly two dozen other states and cities, and two reproductive rights groups. “Once again, the courts have blocked the Trump administration from implementing a discriminatory rule that would only hurt Americans,” James said in a statement following the ruling. “The refusal of care rule was an unlawful attempt to allow health care providers to openly discriminate.”
Critics of the the rule argued that it would disproportionately affect the LGBTQ population by giving further protection to providers to deny care to patients based on their identities.
“Today, the Trump administration was blocked from providing legal cover for discrimination,” Alexis McGill, acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, said in a statement. “As the federal district court made clear, the administration acted outside its authority and made false claims to try to justify this rule. This rule put patients’ needs last and threatened their ability to access potentially lifesaving health care.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and more recently a lobbyist at a firm with extensive ties to President Donald Trump, will join the White House communications staff temporarily to help with messaging during the ongoing impeachment inquiry, according to reports Wednesday.
Talk about a revolving door.
In September 2013, the Donald J. Trump Foundation gave $25,000 to Bondi’s campaign for reelection as attorney general. A month later, Bondi announced that Florida would not join other states suing Trump for fraud over Trump University’s marketing of its seminars on real estate and management, even though many of Trump’s alleged victims lived in Florida. A Florida state prosecutor later said there was no evidence that the donation was illegal, but the incident has left Bondi dogged by allegations that she took a bribe from Trump.
But when Bondi left office, she didn’t exactly steer clear of ethical concerns. She joined Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm that touts its ties to Trump. Brian Ballard, the firm’s founder and a former lobbyist for Trump in Florida, launched the firm in 2017, capitalizing on Trump’s election. Starting last January, Bondi helped Ballard lobby the White House for clients including General Motors, Major League Baseball, and the Government of Qatar.
Bondi will work directly for Trump. That is a resume straight out of what Trump and his allies used to call the swamp.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee continues to flirt with the idea of running for president in 2012, but Fox News, one of his current employers, is getting annoyed by Huckabee’s wavering. So annoyed, in fact, that the network has given him an end-of-May deadline to decide, according to RealClearPolitics’ Erin McPike.
Huckabee faces the same situation as former Fox contributors Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. When they announced their respective presidential plans, Fox suspended their contracts in March. And since neither Gingrich nor Santorum pulled out of the race by May 1, their contracts are set to be terminated by Fox.
Huckabee, meanwhile, has continued to host his eponymous talk show on Saturday and Sunday nights while Republican operatives have quietly begun organizing a Huckabee ground campaign. Here’s RCPs’ McPike:

Listen up, young would-be vandals: SonicScreen, a new device designed to keep muskrats and miscreants out of family-friendly spaces could be headed for a playground, park, or schoolyard near you.
The device generates a modulated high-frequency tone that Jay Webber, who has installed these devices, claims can only be heard by people in the 13- to 25-year-old age range. A motion sensor detects your possibly pubescent presence and emits this harmless-but-abrasive signal until you get away from the monkey bars—or wherever you’re not wanted. “For young people, it sounds like 15 or 20 people dragging their nails down a chalkboard,” Webber told the Pioneer Press, a daily newspaper in Twin Cities, Minnesota.

City officials in Hastings, Minnesota, are currently debating whether to buy the $7,000 device, but they aren’t the first in the US to do so. Moving Sound Technologies installed its own version in Washington, DC’s Gallery Place Metro station. It received mixed results and was eventually removed after David Moss of the National Youth Rights Association filed a complaint with the DC Office of Human Rights. There are similar products in the European market such as the Mosquito Alarm, installed in front of shops to discourage loiterers. Youth advocacy critics find the device discriminatory, anti-teen, and an inappropriate strategy. In the UK, a government-appointed children’s commissioner even launched a campaign called Buzz Off, aimed at banning the Mosquito Alarm.
Moss lodged a similar complaint against the proposed SonicScreen installation in Hastings, claiming that the device “lacks precision and can affect a wide variety of innocents,” especially “autistic children and children with special hearing needs.” Children’s Rights Alliance, a London-based youth-empowerment lobbying group set up after the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, reports that these high-frequency soundwaves harm young ears—and that children from 8 to 13 have reported that the sound wakes them up at night.
Installing SonicScreen, of course, is no panacea for loiterers and vandals and fails to address the root ill conveniently toetipped by a technological fix. Vandalism is an expensive local problem and needs creative solutions. Yet, vandalism is by no means limited to teenagers, and the SonicScreen cannot stop the 26 and up age set from wreaking havoc if they so choose.
In urban areas, public spaces are scarce enough as it is, and youngsters need places away from the watchful eyes of their helicopter parents. Installing such devices may even be an incentive to vandalize—certainly the device, if not everything in the vicinity. In 2004, when I was fined for being too young to sit on a fountain outside a galleria mall, the thought certainly flashed through my mind. In any case, communities had better prepare for teen rebellion if they start installing these gadgets on every street corner.

Legal assistance for the poor will take a huge hit under a proposal just released by the House Appropriations Committee, which aims to slash the budget of the Legal Services Corporation back to 1999 levels. Officials at LSC, which has been around for four decades and supports 136 independent legal-aid outposts all over America, knew big cuts were coming—the program was by no means exempt from DC’s budget-slashing hysteria. But supporters were betting on losing $70 million, the figure proposed last year during budget negotiations.
The new proposal would take away $104 million—26 percent of the program’s resources—at a time when demand is soaring. Legal-aid offices from Texas to Maine report that the need for their services already has been outstripping funding for years.
“Demand is just going to keep going up. People are still losing their jobs. People are still struggling to put food on the table. Foreclosures are still happening,” says Cynthia Martinez, spokeswoman for Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, the state’s largest legal-services agency. “Last year, we had to turn away half of the people that came to us because we just don’t have the resources. And it’s not like when we say no, the legal problems just go away.”
You’ll hear similar stories nationwide. “We know that in February we were only able to handle about 20 percent of the calls that were actually tracked on our voicemail system, in one office location,” said Nan Heald, executive director of Pine Tree Legal Assistance, Maine’s largest legal-services provider. “And a lot of people don’t even get through on the phones because they’re busy.”
More of those who do get through, Heald says, “are getting limited service rather than full representation, because we’re trying to manage the demand with reduced staff.” She has lost seven staffers since 2009. It’s not just the federal cuts that are hurting these agencies. “We get foundations, we get individual donations, state grants, state funding. All of our funding sources are dropping,” Heald adds.
In Texas, a bill providing $20 million for legal services was passed only after a major fight in the state legislature, and Gov. Rick Perry has yet to sign it. In Florida, renowned for its “rocket-docket” foreclosure courts, Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a bill providing $1 million in funding for legal aid, despite broad bipartisan support.
Another key funding source for legal services comes through interest on lawyers’ trust accounts. When a lawyer wins a cash settlement for a client, the money often goes into a pooled account before it’s paid out. The interest on that money is used to support civil legal services. But with interest rates plummeting, that revenue source has also been gutted.
Already, the legal-aid nonprofits supported by the LSC are slated to lose a total of 445 staff members, including 200 lawyers, by the end of 2011, according to a survey of the groups. Last year, 63 million people—an all-time high—qualified for their help, an increase of 11 percent from the year before. “This is not the time to undercut the fundamental American commitment to equal justice for all,” says Legal Services president James Sandman.
“There is never a convenient time to make tough decisions,” counters Frank Wolf, chair of the House subcommittee responsible for the LSC’s budget. “But the longer we put off fixing the problem, the worse the medicine will be…The bill represents our best take on matching needs with scarce resources.”
Heald says she understands the need to cut spending, but explains that legal services has a “preventive effect” that actually saves money for the states. Housing a family in a homeless shelter in Maine for just two or three weeks is five to ten times more expensive than supporting a lawyer who can help keep the family in stable housing, she says. “And that’s just the cost of the shelter nights, and not the cost on all the other supportive systems a family might need.”
“I think it’s important to have the full picture, and not to see just part of it,” she adds.
For now, the hopes of the legal aid community hinge on the Senate. “We’re hopeful that things will continue to be okay, and we’re not going to face these major cuts,” said Linda Perle, director of legal services at the DC-based Center for Law and Social Policy. “But that might just be wishful thinking.”
If the proposed cuts do take effect, the LSC estimates that 235,000 people eligible for help will be turned away. And that will have a direct impact on vulnerable Americans, Rodriguez says.
“It means that more people won’t have the support they need,” she says, “to assert their rights in desperate situations.”

The same conservative activists who brought you the New Black Panther nontroversy are on a new crusade against the Obama Department of Justice, accusing the agency of “politicized hiring.” Senator Chuck Grassley, seizing on those accusations, told civil rights division chief Thomas E. Perez that he believed the division’s hiring choices reflected ideological bias during a Senate hearing Tuesday.
The background for that accusation comes from two former Bush-era Justice Department employees, Hans von Spakovsky and J. Christian Adams, who have been documenting so-called “politicization in hiring” in the division by pointing out that many of the recent hires have backgrounds in civil rights law. Many of the attorneys, though, have simply worked at organizations arbitrarily labeled “liberal,” such as the Red Cross or the New York State Bar Association. As I wrote here last week, National Review blogger Ed Whelan went even farther, singling out two division attorneys for being in same-sex relationships.
“Based on organizational affiliations listed, it has hired 96 liberals and zero conservatives,” Grassley said. “It would be more accurate to state that to the division, civil rights experience is limited to experience with liberal advocacy groups.” Grassley added that he was asking the Inspector General to look into the matter.
Grassley didn’t follow up on the issue during questioning. But in response to a question from Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, Perez copped to the charge of hiring civil rights lawyers to work in the civil rights division.
“I plead guilty to that,” he said. “Relevant experience is indeed very very helpful. My brother the surgeon hires surgeons in his surgical practice. I think it’s important to hire people who have that relevant experience.”
As for “politicized hiring,” Perez said that since taking the leadership of the division, he’d put the hiring process back into the hands of career attorneys. He also instituted a new rule that forces division leaders who want to overrule a hiring decision to justify their position in writing. (That hasn’t happened yet, Perez said.) During the Bush administration, by contrast, emails disclosed in a Justice Department report revealed that political appointees made hiring decisions based on whether or not applicants were “commies” (liberals) or “right-thinking Americans” (conservatives). During that time, enforcement of most civil rights laws declined. In the past two years, the division has consecutively broken records in filing criminal cases, Perez said.
“My proudest moment was to restore that career driven hiring process that has produced the remarkable cadre of people that has enabled us to take that division to higher and higher levels,” Perez said.
As for Perez’ accusers, Von Spakovsky was part of the political leadership at the civil rights division when an internal investigation found that Bush era-division head Bradley Schlozman had broken civil service laws with partisan hiring practices. Adams was hired during this period, and went on to draw attention as a “whistleblower” by accusing the civil rights division of anti-white racism in its handling of the New Black Panther voter intimidation case. Those allegations that were later found to be groundless by the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility. In other words, the people who are attacking Perez are associated with an era at DOJ during which the leadership of the division was doing exactly what they’re accusing Perez of doing.
Though Grassley seems to have embraced the latest right-wing crusade against the Obama Justice Department, he didn’t sign up for the full gay-baiting witch hunt. Whether or not the right latches onto this as tightly as the New Black Panther case is anyone’s guess.

If Clarence Thomas was hoping that liberals might just forget about his cozy ties to a Dallas real estate developer, or his failure for a decade to disclose the hundreds of thousands of dollars his wife earned from a conservative think tank, well, he would be wrong. As President Obama’s health care reform bill gets closer and closer to a hearing before the high court, liberal groups are continuing to press for some sort of disciplinary action against Thomas, or at least to force him to recuse himself from hearing the health care case.
To that end, on Tuesday, the left-leaning Alliance for Justice and the good-government group Common Cause asked the Judicial Conference of the United States, which oversees the federal courts, to investigate whether Thomas violated the Ethics in Government Act. The groups allege that Thomas may have violated the act when he failed to disclose his wife Ginny Thomas’s compensation—upwards of $700,000—from the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The groups also are asking the Judicial Conference to investigate whether Thomas may have failed to report travel paid for by the Texas real estate developer Harlan Crowe, as reported by the New York Times. The Judicial Conference was holding its semi-annual meeting in DC this week when the advocacy groups sent their letter. If the Conference concludes that the allegations have merit, federal law requires that if it “has reasonable cause to believe has willfully falsified or willfully failed to file information required to be reported” it must refer the case to the attorney general. Common Cause president Bob Edgar said in a statement Tuesday:
Odds are slim that even the Judicial Conference is going to ask Eric Holder to investigate Thomas. But you can’t really fault them for trying. Thomas’s lapses seem egregious enough for some higher authority to take a second look.
Unfortunately, thanks the the separation of powers doctrine, there really isn’t a higher authority when it comes to the Supreme Court. Some members of Congress are trying to change that. Also this week, the Alliance for Justice has been trying to rally support for congressional hearings on a bill introduced earlier this year that would force Supreme Court justices to be covered by the code of conduct that applies to other federal judges and create new procedures for when a justice may have to recuse from hearing a case. Given that virtually no Republicans have signed on, this law, too, has no hope of going anywhere, at least not any time soon. But the Democrats behind it get points for trying anyway.
*As a completely unrelated side note, Thomas came to mind as I was reading this article earlier this week about how NASCAR has started installing solar panels and recycling and employing flocks of sheep to mow the track lawns. I have to wonder whether Thomas, a former Monsanto employee, might have second thoughts about his anti-environmental positions now that even NASCAR has gone green. A little-known fact about Thomas is that in his spare time, he and Ginny drive their gas-guzzling, 40-foot custom-built bus to NASCAR races, where they hang out with ordinary Americans who often don’t even recognize the Supreme Court’s most bitter member. Perhaps some of NASCAR’s new-found environmental consciousness will rub off.

During his decade in office, Texas Gov. Rick Perry has named Sarah Palin, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck as “honorary Texans.” He may be the first Lone Star State governor to use the award to such brazen political ends, but he’s sure not the first to use it to get attention. Here’s the lowdown on 10 of the most interesting honorees.
Governor: Alan Shivers (D) 
Honorary Texan: General George MacArthur (1951)Lowdown: The three-star general received the honor in Austin while on a tour to promote a stronger military stance against Korea. His son was named “Honorary Junior Texas Ranger.” The general later led a parade in Houston attended by 500,000 people and visited Galveston, where he was to receive a Cadillac.
Governor: John Connally (D)Honorary Texans: 100th and 442nd US Army Regiments (1962)Lowdown: Composed of Japanese-American soldiers enlisted from WW II internment camps, these regiments suffered the highest casualty rates of any Army formations. Particularly severe were the 800 deaths sustained in rescuing the “Lost Battalion”—221 Texans trapped in eastern France.
Governor: Preston Smith (D)Honorary Texan: Shirley MacLaine (1972)Lowdown: Upon receiving her award, the actress-activist said, “Next time I’m in Texas, I hope I’m awarded this by Cissy Farenthold.” Farenthold was the congresswoman who’d lost the Democratic nomination to Smith that spring.
Governor: Dolph Briscoe (D)Honorary Texan: Christi Worthington (circa 1976):Lowdown: Worthington’s father, a Texan jeweler who’d relocated to Iowa, wrote his mother and asked her to send a bag of dirt so that his baby would be born on Texas soil. He then successfully petitioned the governor to make his daughter an honorary Texan.
Governor: Bill Clements (R)Honorary Texan: Deng Xioping (1979)Lowdown: A decade before the Chinese leader stood behind the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, he was made an honorary Texan, given a cowboy hat, and treated to a rodeo and barbecue. Looking back on the affair, the Houston Chronicle wrote, “Herein lies a lesson for all Americans concerning the diplomatic conventions of civility and hospitality, and the harsh realities of totalitarian dictatorships.”
Governor: Ann Richards (D)Honorary Texan: Bob Hope (1992)Lowdown: Richards handed the actor his certificate of Texan citizenship and said, “This entitles you to come to the mansion and see me anytime you want, honey.”
Governor: George W. Bush (R)Honorary Texan: William Hague (1999)Lowdown: “I might be persuaded to wear the boots, but I’m certainly not going to wear the hat,” the leader of Great Britain’s Conservative Party said upon receiving the honor.Honorary Texan: Bob Dylan (1999)Lowdown: In 2009, after mentioning his Texas citizenship in an interview with the UK’s Sunday Times, Dylan had this to say about Bush’s legacy: “As far as blaming everything on the last president, think of it this way: the same folks who had held him in such high regard came to despise him. Isn’t it funny that they’re the very same people who once loved him? People are fickle. Their loyalty can turn at the drop of a hat.”
Governor: Rick PerryHonorary Texan: Russell Crowe (2001)Lowdown: The Gladiator star received the award from Perry shortly before his band played Perry’s daughter’s 15th birthday party.Honorary Texan: Glenn Beck (2010)Lowdown: When Perry presented the award to the Fox News host at a “Taking Back America” rally at the Oil Palace in Tyler, Beck says he asked the governor, “Is there ever going to be a time when I’m going to need to use this as a passport?”

This October marks the 20th anniversary of the infamous confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in which he almost didn’t make it to the high court due to allegations that he’d sexually harassed Anita Hill at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. House Democrats would apparently like to commemorate this event by subjecting Thomas to a new round of hearings on the Hill. On the steps of the Supreme Court this morning, Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-NY) and others held a press conference calling on the House Judiciary Committee to hold hearings investigating some of Thomas’s alleged ethical lapses. These include allegations that he failed to disclose at least $1.6 million in income earned by his wife Virginia, who worked for the conservative Heritage Foundation and has been an active opponent of the Obama health care law. Thomas has also been accused of taking unreported free trips on a corporate jet and a yacht from real estate magnate Harlan Crow.
Blumenauer wrote to the House Judiciary committee members:
The request comes on the heels of demands by 19 House members that the US Judicial Conference, which oversees the federal courts, ask the Justice Department to investigate Thomas’s alleged violations of the Ethics in Government Act for all of the omissions on his financial disclosure forms. Thomas has said it was simply an oversight and that he misunderstood how to fill out the forms. He has since amended the forms to include the missing income.  (In a statement, Slaughter has dismissed his explanation saying, “To believe that Justice Thomas didn’t know how to fill out a basic disclosure form is absurd.”)
None of the congressional grandstanding is likely to amount to much, given how difficult it is to remove a sitting Supreme Court justice from the bench. Besides, House Republicans would have to agree to any hearing on Thomas’s conduct, and that’s never going to happen. But liberal activists and their partners in Congress aren’t necessarily looking for Thomas to step down. They want him to recuse himself from voting on the Obama health care reform law that the court is likely to hear before the next presidential election. Of course, conservatives are doing the same thing. They’re waging a concerted campaign to pressure new Justice Elena Kagan to also recuse herself from the health care case based on her service in the Obama administration as solicitor general. In the end, both justices will probably ignore all the background noise. But the fight will certainly make for interesting political theater along the way.

Former GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has some advice for people who support the anti-union law passed in Ohio that faces a statewide repeal vote on November 8: Find out who’s voting to repeal the bill and block them from ballot box. The onetime Arkansas governor suggested deflating tires and giving these voters the wrong election date. “That’s up to you, how you creatively get the job done,” Huckabee quipped.
Huckabee’s remarks came during an appearance on Friday in Mason, Ohio, before a crowd of 350 people, according to MasonBuzz, a local blog that first reported the remarks. On November 8, Ohioans will vote on Issue 2, a much-contested ballot referendum on whether to repeal Gov. John Kasich’s controversial anti-union legislation (known as SB 5) that curbed collective bargaining rights for his state’s public-sector unions. Recent polls have shown that a majority of Ohioans support repealing Kasich’s bill. Enter Huckabee. He has been stumping for voting yes on Issue 2—that is, to uphold Kasich’s anti-union bill—urging members of the audience to do the same, and to pray in support of the measure. As part of his plea, Huckabee told the Mason crowd:
Local media have suggested Huckabee’s voter suppression suggestions were offered a joke. Below is the audio of Huckabee’s remarks (the voter suppression part begins at 12:00). You be the judge:

Huckabee’s advice came at the end of a bitter stretch in the SB 5 fight. Earlier in the week, a group backing the law was caught manipulating an ad supporting SB 5’s repeal and remaking the spot to say the opposite. In the original ad, paid for by the union-allied We Are Ohio group, an elderly woman named Marlene Quinn credits firefighters with saving the life of her great-granddaughter, Zoey, during a house fire, and says that voting to repeal Kasich’s anti-union bill will help firefighters do their job. But in the recut version, the pro-SB 5 group Building a Better Ohio (whose staff includes Kasich’s former chief of staff) selectively edited the first ad’s footage to make it appear as if Quinn supports SB 5. We Are Ohio and other repeal supporters immediately condemned the disingenuous ad, and at least 30 TV stations pulled it from the airwaves. Quinn called the recut ad “dishonest and downright deceitful” and said she felt “violated.” However, Building a Better Ohio has stood behind the ad, and Gov. Kasich said “what they’re doing is fine.”
Melissa Fazekas, a spokeswoman for We Are Ohio, says Huckabee’s comments were “really shocking” and a clear example that SB 5 supporters “are willing to go to extremes” to silence Ohioans who oppose SB 5. Given that the fight over SB 5 has been a front line in the national clash over union rights, what happens on November 8 will hardly be a joke.

	Politics","This story first appeared on the TomDispatch website.
As intense protests spawned by Occupy Wall Street continue to grow, it is worth asking: Why now? The answer is not obvious. After all, severe income and wealth inequality have long plagued the United States. In fact, it could reasonably be claimed that this form of inequality is part of the design of the American founding—indeed, an integral part of it.
Income inequality has worsened over the past several years and is at its highest level since the Great Depression. This is not, however, a new trend. Income inequality has been growing at rapid rates for three decades. As journalist Tim Noah described the process:
During the late 1980s and the late 1990s, the United States experienced two unprecedentedly long periods of sustained economic growth—the “seven fat years” and the “long boom.” Yet from 1980 to 2005, more than 80 percent of total increase in Americans’ income went to the top 1 percent. Economic growth was more sluggish in the aughts, but the decade saw productivity increase by about 20 percent. Yet virtually none of the increase translated into wage growth at middle and lower incomes, an outcome that left many economists scratching their heads.
The 2008 financial crisis exacerbated the trend, but not radically: The top 1 percent of earners in America have been feeding ever more greedily at the trough for decades.
In addition, substantial wealth inequality is so embedded in American political culture that, standing alone, it would not be sufficient to trigger citizen rage of the type we are finally witnessing. The American Founders were clear that they viewed inequality in wealth, power, and prestige as not merely inevitable, but desirable and, for some, even divinely ordained. Jefferson praised “the natural aristocracy” as “the most precious gift of nature” for the “government of society.” John Adams concurred: “It already appears, that there must be in every society of men superiors and inferiors, because God has laid in the…course of nature the foundation of the distinction.”
Not only have the overwhelming majority of Americans long acquiesced to vast income and wealth disparities, but some of those most oppressed by these outcomes have cheered it loudly. Americans have been inculcated not only to accept but to revere those who are the greatest beneficiaries of this inequality.
In the 1980s, this paradox—whereby even those most trampled upon come to cheer those responsible for their state—became more firmly entrenched. That’s because it found a folksy, friendly face, Ronald Reagan, adept at feeding the populace a slew of Orwellian clichés that induced them to defend the interests of the wealthiest. “A rising tide,” as President Reagan put it, “lifts all boats.” The sum of his wisdom being: It is in your interest when the rich get richer.
Implicit in this framework was the claim that inequality was justified and legitimate. The core propagandistic premise was that the rich were rich because they deserved to be. They innovated in industry, invented technologies, discovered cures, created jobs, took risks, and boldly found ways to improve our lives. In other words, they deserved to be enriched. Indeed, it was in our common interest to allow them to fly as high as possible because that would increase their motivation to produce more, bestowing on us ever greater life-improving gifts.
We should not, so the thinking went, begrudge the multimillionaire living behind his 15-foot walls for his success; we should admire him. Corporate bosses deserved not our resentment but our gratitude. It was in our own interest not to demand more in taxes from the wealthiest but less, as their enhanced wealth—their pocket change—would trickle down in various ways to all of us.
This is the mentality that enabled massive growth in income and wealth inequality over the past several decades without much at all in the way of citizen protest. And yet something has indeed changed. It’s not that Americans suddenly woke up one day and decided that substantial income and wealth inequality are themselves unfair or intolerable. What changed was the perception of how that wealth was gotten and so of the ensuing inequality as legitimate.
Many Americans who once accepted or even cheered such inequality now see the gains of the richest as ill-gotten, as undeserved, as cheating. Most of all, the legal system that once served as the legitimizing anchor for outcome inequality, the rule of law—that most basic of American ideals, that a common set of rules are equally applied to all—has now become irrevocably corrupted and is seen as such.
While the Founders accepted outcome inequality, they emphasized—over and over—that its legitimacy hinged on subjecting everyone to the law’s mandates on an equal basis. Jefferson wrote that the essence of America would be that “the poorest laborer stood on equal ground with the wealthiest millionaire, and generally on a more favored one whenever their rights seem to jar.” Benjamin Franklin warned that creating a privileged legal class would produce “total separation of affections, interests, political obligations, and all manner of connections” between rulers and those they ruled. Tom Paine repeatedly railed against “counterfeit nobles,” those whose superior status was grounded not in merit but in unearned legal privilege.
After all, one of their principal grievances against the British king was his power to exempt his cronies from legal obligations. Almost every Founder repeatedly warned that a failure to apply the law equally to the politically powerful and the rich would ensure a warped and unjust society. In many ways, that was their definition of tyranny.
Americans understand this implicitly. If you watch a competition among sprinters, you can accept that whoever crosses the finish line first is the superior runner. But only if all the competitors are bound by the same rules: Everyone begins at the same starting line, is penalized for invading the lane of another runner, is barred from making physical contact or using performance-enhancing substances, and so on.
If some of the runners start ahead of others and have relationships with the judges that enable them to receive dispensation for violating the rules as they wish, then viewers understand that the outcome can no longer be considered legitimate. Once the process is seen as not only unfair but utterly corrupted, once it’s obvious that a common set of rules no longer binds all the competitors, the winner will be resented, not heralded.
That catches the mood of America in 2011. It may not explain the Occupy Wall Street movement, but it helps explain why it has spread like wildfire and why so many Americans seem instantly to accept and support it. As was not true in recent decades, the American relationship with wealth inequality is in a state of rapid transformation.
It is now clearly understood that, rather than apply the law equally to all, Wall Street tycoons have engaged in egregious criminality—acts which destroyed the economic security of millions of people around the world—without experiencing the slightest legal repercussions. Giant financial institutions were caught red-handed engaging in massive, systematic fraud to foreclose on people’s homes, and the reaction of the political class, led by the Obama administration, was to shield them from meaningful consequences. Rather than submit on an equal basis to the rules, through an oligarchical, democracy-subverting control of the political process, they now control the process of writing those rules and how they are applied.
Today, it is glaringly obvious to a wide range of Americans that the wealth of the top 1 percent is the byproduct not of risk-taking entrepreneurship but of corrupted control of our legal and political systems. Thanks to this control, they can write laws that have no purpose than to abolish the few limits that still constrain them, as happened during the Wall Street deregulation orgy of the 1990s. They can retroactively immunize themselves for crimes they deliberately committed for profit, as happened when the 2008 Congress shielded the nation’s telecom giants for their role in Bush’s domestic warrantless eavesdropping program.
It is equally obvious that they are using that power not to lift the boats of ordinary Americans but to sink them. In short, Americans are now well aware of what the second highest ranking Democrat in the Senate, Illinois’s Dick Durbin, blurted out in 2009 about the body in which he serves: The banks “frankly own the place.”
If you were to assess the state of the union in 2011, you might sum it up this way: Rather than being subjected to the rule of law, the nation’s most powerful oligarchs control the law and are so exempt from it, and increasing numbers of Americans understand that and are outraged. At exactly the same time that the nation’s elites enjoy legal immunity even for egregious crimes, ordinary Americans are being subjected to the world’s largest and one of its harshest penal states, under which they are unable to secure competent legal counsel and are harshly punished with lengthy prison terms for even trivial infractions.
In lieu of the rule of law—the equal application of rules to everyone—what we have now is a two-tiered justice system in which the powerful are immunized while the powerless are punished with increasing mercilessness. As a guarantor of outcomes, the law has, by now, been so completely perverted that it is an incomparably potent weapon for entrenching inequality further, controlling the powerless, and ensuring corrupted outcomes.
The tide that was supposed to lift all ships has, in fact, left startling numbers of Americans underwater. In the process, we lost any sense that a common set of rules applies to everyone, and so there is no longer a legitimizing anchor for the vast income and wealth inequalities that plague the nation.
That is what has changed, and a growing recognition of what it means is fueling rising citizen anger and protest. The inequality under which so many suffer is not only vast, but illegitimate, rooted as it is in lawlessness and corruption. Obscuring that fact has long been the linchpin for inducing Americans to accept vast and growing inequalities. That fact is now too glaring to obscure any longer.

	Politics","
After Cory Maples was convicted of two murders in Alabama in 1997 and sentenced to death, he appealed his conviction claiming that he’d received shoddy legal representation, what’s technically known as ineffective assistance of counsel. Two attorneys from Sullivan & Cromwell, a prestigious law firm in New York, agreed to represent him.
Alabama doesn’t provide inmates with post-conviction legal assistance. By securing free representation from two attorneys from a hotshot New York law firm, Maples must have thought he had a decent chance in court. A dream come true, right?
Didn’t turn out that way. The two attorneys, Jaasai Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, left the firm in 2002, in the middle of Maples’ appeal process. They didn’t tell Maples that they were leaving, or that they weren’t going to be involved in his case anymore. They didn’t even tell the court in Alabama. So when the court denied Maples’ appeal in 2003, he had no idea. Maples’ Alabama-based attorney (the state requires a state-licensed attorney to be on the appeal team) did receive the court’s notification that Maples’ appeal had been rejected, but he did nothing about it. (He’d previously told Maple’s New York-based lawyers that he’d be involved in the case only as much as the law required him to be.) By the time other attorneys at Sullivan & Cromwell decided to pick up the case, the 42-day deadline for appealing the court’s rejection had already passed. Maples had essentially been left high and dry by his lawyers, two of whom had bailed without bothering to inform the court, and one of whom had effectively washed his hands of the case from the beginning. As far as Maples knew, he had lawyers. He didn’t.
The lower courts rejected Maples’ pleas for another chance to file an appeal, despite the conduct of his attorneys. But on Wednesday, the Supreme Court reversed that decision by a vote of 7 to 2, with Justice Antonin Scalia writing a dissent joined by Clarence Thomas. Their argument? If you allow Maples to file an appeal despite missing the original deadline because he was abandoned by his attorneys, then defense attorneys all over the country could argue that their clients had been effectively unrepresented at one point or another, gambling on the possibility that the big-hearted, black-robed softies on the Supreme Court would overlook any procedural errors that might have been made during their appeals.
Under the law, merely having a crappy lawyer who misses deadlines isn’t normally enough to get a second chance. This makes sense. It prevents people from trying to take advantage of the system through deliberate incompetence. The difference here is that Maples didn’t have a crappy lawyer. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg points out in her majority opinion, he essentially didn’t have a lawyer at all.
You might be wondering how exactly Scalia and Thomas could be so indifferent to someone who gets so royally shafted by his attorneys. Despite today’s 7 to 2 ruling, this court has rarely been sympathetic to defendants when it comes to procedural matters and criminal justice. This goes double for Scalia and Thomas. This is, after all, a court that overturned a financial reward for a man who spent years in prison for crimes he didn’t commit and found that the Fourth Amendment right to unreasonable searches and seizures doesn’t exist if the faint smell of marijuana smoke tickles a cop’s nostrils while he happens to be standing near your apartment. Four of the justices think there’s nothing cruel and unusual about California stacking its prisoners like boxes in an Amazon warehouse. We haven’t even gotten to Scalia harrumphing that it’s irrelevant whether Troy Davis was “actually innocent.”
Alabama is in a different league when it comes to the death penalty, executing inmates at a rate six times higher than Texas, which has about five times as many people. Juries need not be unanimous in death penalty cases. Judges are allowed to override jury verdicts and impose the death penalty if they feel like it. Alabama judges have been known to brag about their body counts during their reelection campaigns. They have strong political incentives to execute people, and as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writes in her majority opinion, the state has made it particularly easy by lowering legal standards for public defenders and capping state reimbursements for legal expenses for those attorneys who do choose to represent their clients in post-conviction proceedings. This all reflects a particular worldview: The possibility that the convicted are actually innocent is so slim that taxpayers shouldn’t be on the hook for whatever legal shenanigans they might try.
That worldview permeates Alito’s concurring opinion. Despite agreeing with the majority that Maples got a raw deal, Alito takes a few pages to deny that there’s anything wrong with the way Alabama handles the death penalty, calling the Maples case “a veritable perfect storm of misfortune” not indicative of any larger issues. Not only that, but Alito says there’s no problem with forcing inmates sentenced to death to rely on the kindness of strangers. Alito notes that Sullivan & Cromwell “is one of the country’s most prestigious and expensive” firms, and adds that “I have little doubt that the vast majority of criminal defendants would think that they had won the lottery” if they were to be represented by the firm’s attorneys.
Except for Maples it turned out to be a nightmare.
Still, Scalia’s dissent has to rank up there with his greatest hits. He writes coldly that “the client bears the risk of all attorney errors made in the course of the representation, regardless of the egregiousness of the mistake.” That’s even if the “mistake” is a lawyer not bothering to tell someone facing possible execution that they’re not representing them anymore. What’s the big deal? It’s not like anyone’s life is at stake.

With the Federal Election Commission filings in, it’s clear that conservatives are decisively winning the 2012 super-PAC race—at least so far. Republican-leaning super-PACs focused on the presidential race or backing a particular candidate raised more than seven times what Democratic-leaning super-PAC’s raised, more than $60 million to the Democrats’ $8 million.
What’s the reason for the disparity?
Attorney Neil Reiff, an expert in campaign finance law with the firm Reiff, Young & Lamb, said President Obama “discouraging the formation of super-PACs” might have something to do with the numbers, adding that “presidential fundraising might be sucking all the wind out of the fundraising out of the super-PACs.” Obama’s campaign has raised $140 million so far.
A Democrat involved in fundraising for super-PACs pointed to the ongoing Republican primary as a major reason, arguing that Democratic donors would open their wallets as the general election approached. “Is anyone really that surprised that oil companies and private equity billionaires are enthusiastic about beating president Obama?” the Democratic operative said.

Breast cancer foundation Susan G. Komen for the Cure has reversed its decision to stop funding cancer screening referrals by Planned Parenthood, according to a letter from founder Nancy Brinker first obtained by Tom Benning at the Dallas Morning News and posted on the organization’s website.
The letter reads in part:
It’s not entirely clear what this means. Since their initial announcement on Tuesday, Komen representatives have offered an avalanche of shifting explanations for their decision to stop funding Planned Parenthood. Those justifications have ranged from a new policy forbidding funding any organization if it or one of its affiliates was under any kind of government investigation to arguing that the problem was that some Planned Parenthood affiliates offered referrals instead of mammograms. But other organizations that received grants from Komen (such as Penn State) were not held to the same standard regarding investigations, and the probe of Planned Parenthood, initiated by an anti-abortion Republican congressman, was seen by critics as political witch hunt. There are problems with the referral argument, too. As my colleague Kate Sheppard wrote on Thursday, criticism of Planned Parenthood over not performing mammograms was something of a “red herring,” because “If you have health insurance and a primary care physician or gynecologist, that is generally the person who will refer you for additional care if they find reason for concern after an initial screening. But if a woman doesn’t have insurance or a regular doctor, clinics like Planned Parenthood are her point of entry.”
Given what Komen officials have said about their new standards requiring direct services, Friday’s letter leaves one big question—whether Planned Parenthood meets Komen’s criteria for future grants—still unresolved. Komen has not responded to journalists’ requests for clarification, telling the Washington Post‘s Ezra Klein that its statement “speaks for itself.”
Throughout the backlash, Komen’s leadership insisted its decision to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood was not political. Although Brinker herself is a former Bush administration official and has given thousands of dollars to Republicans over the years, Komen has not been widely seen as a partisan organization. But Karen Handel, Komen’s senior vice president for public policy, is a former Republican secretary of state from Georgia who is avowedly anti-abortion. A report from Jeffrey Goldberg at The Atlantic suggested the Planned Parenthood decision had been “driven” by Handel, and the new standards were a mere pretext for eliminating Komen’s funding for Planned Parenthood. (No retraction or correction has been made, and Goldberg says he stands by his reporting.) On Friday morning, Goldberg posted internal memos from Komen instructing employees on how to properly spin the decision.
The outcry seems to have helped fundraising at both organizations. On Thursday, both Komen and Planned Parenthood announced large donations, with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledging $250,000 to Planned Parenthood and Brinker saying that contributions to Komen were up “one hundred percent.”
UPDATE: A Komen board member tells the Washington Post‘s Greg Sargent that “It would be unfair to expect the group to commit to future grants.”
UPDATE II: Planned Parenthood sends out a statement saying:
The crucial question remains whether or not that partnership actually exists after today, or whether this is just a more amicable divorce.

On Friday, day three of Susan G. Komen’s mission/PR clusterf*ck, the group announced it was reversing its decision to defund Planned Parenthood. Well, sort of. What Komen reversed was the claim that PPFA had been blackballed because it was under investigation. The question of PPFA getting further funding is left open until the next grant cycle. Can meet road.
This non-reversal reversal was just the latest example of terrible crisis communications that compounded what was a mind-blowingly stupid decision to begin with. How did Komen come to such a terrible decision? (Hint.) Once made, why did they let Planned Parenthood frame it? Why did they wait almost two full days after the story broke—meanwhile hemorrhaging advisory board members, chapters, corporate sponsors, donors, and enduring poignant disappointment at the hands of Andrea Mitchell and Judy Blume fer Christ’s sake—before even attempting to control the damage?
These mysteries have all been much pondered, and I won’t do so here again. The question now before Komen is: Can it regain the trust of all those women and men who ran 5Ks and bought boatloads of pink stuff in the belief that this was the best way to ensure breast cancer research, screenings, and treatment?
The answer to that question, as to all the previous ones, lies with the board.
Source: Susan G. Komen 2009-2010 Annual ReportLet me stipulate: I’ve long had mixed feelings about Komen. Years ago, I edited Barbara Ehrenreich’s “Welcome to Cancerland,” so I was well versed in “pinkwashing,” i.e. corporations donating a miniscule fraction of money earned from peddling stuff adorned with Komen’s pink ribbon to cancer research, or holding a run (after which less than half of the proceeds go to “the cause,” pre-overhead) rather than, say, providing decent health care to workers or keeping toxins out of water supply. I was also aware that Komen had threatened to sue other charities for daring to use “for the cure” in their marketing. That Komen had denied the link between BPA and cancer (while taking in lots of money from BPA makers and users) and generally prioritized “treatment” and “the cure” over “prevention.” But hey, Komen did “raise awareness,” and when you’re talking about a disease that afflicts 1 out of every 8 American women, maybe you take the good with the bad, right?
I knew too that the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure™ had purposefully strived for a nonpartisan image (despite the fact that founder/CEO Nancy Brinker was a major Bush funder and ambassador) and that part of that was staying on the sidelines about issues of choice. A perfectly reasonable course.
But the board abandoned neutrality when, as part of a larger attack on Planned Parenthood that began with the antics of conservative pseudo-journalist James O’Keefe, pro-life groups began targeting Komen for their Planned Parenthood grants. They were assisted from the inside by new Senior VP for Public Policy Karen Handel, who’d recently run for governor of Georgia on a pro-life and stridently anti-Planned Parenthood platform, and further guided by Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer*. [Update: Handel finally fell on her sword and resigned on Feb. 7.]
But all attention that’s been paid to the Handel/Fleischer deus ex machina, however, misses the greater culprit: a sucky board.
What do I mean?
The board of directors (not to be confused with Komen’s multitudinous advisory boards) currently has nine members. There’s Nancy Brinker, who founded Susan G. Komen in the name of her sister, who died of breast cancer. Brinker is a major mover and shaker in Dallas GOP circles, and a former major bundler, a.k.a. “Pioneer,” for George W. Bush. Also on the board is Brinker’s son Eric. Then there’s Dallas socialite/philanthropist/GOP donor/oil baroness/Junior Leaguer Linda Custard, who chairs the board of the elite Hockaday prep school (once attended by G.W. Bush’s daughters), and serves as a trustee for Southern Methodist University (eventual home to the G.W. Bush Library). Connie O’Neill has a similar portfolio; she notably serves on the school district finance committee of the uber tony Highland Park (the most enthusiastically conservative zip code in the country), as well as the Crystal Charity ball, which is ne plus ultra in the world of rich Texas Republicans (and where O’Neill was coincidentally named one of Dallas’ ten best dressed women). Also in the rich Republicans camp is corporate real estate law firm founder (and Silicon Valley VC) Linda Law, who’s a Republican National Committee Regent, meaning a $250,000+ donor.
But wait, there are a few Democrats, including former Nine West executive Brenda Lauderback, who made some modest donations to Obama but is also notable for the number of boards she serves on (Bloomberg Businessweek links her to 51 board members in five different organizations across six different industries). Fellow Obama donor, oncologist Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall Jr., is co-chair of the board, and the only medical professional on it. A bigger Dem donor is lobbyist John D. Raffaelli, whose firm Capital Counsel LLC helps both GOP and Dem causes; he was also the counsel for tax and international trade to former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.). Finally there’s the only board member without any track record of political donation: breast cancer survivor, longtime Komen foot soldier, and VP at a hospital consulting service, Elyse Gellerman, whose job is to represent the Komen affiliates.
But my point isn’t about who’s a Republican and who’s a Democrat. The point is that Komen is a giant grant-making operation (nearly $2 billion since 1982) that purports to represent all of womanhood and it’s being run as if it were still a small family foundation. Brinker and son, Custard, and O’Neill all run in the same circles, sit on the same boards, send their kids to the same elite schools. Komen’s board makes a nod to race (both Lauderback and Leffal are African-American), a nod to medicine, and a nod to someone with pull in DNC circles, but the core is a group of rich, Texan, conservative friends.
There should be more racial and economic and regional diversity, to be sure. But Komen should, and must now if it wants to regain trust, bring on board members who will challenge the way Komen has done business. Like downplaying environmental factors that would be problematic for corporate sponsors. Like being less than honest with runners and ribbon-buyers about how little of the money raised in those events actually goes to research or treatment.
Board members don’t run the day-to-day operations, but they should be (and were) consulted on controversial decisions and they do step in when an organization is in crisis. It’s not likely, but the board’s best move would be to reform itself. Enlist people like Ehrenreich, tech-goddess Xeni Jardin (who’s been chronicling her fight with breast cancer), and Dr. Susan Love, a leading researcher who’s been critical of Komen’s lack of effort toward prevention. Andrea Mitchell wouldn’t hurt either. If you can’t or won’t put them on the board, make sure you somehow capture their POVs.
New energy might, for example, persuade the board that it’s time to change the balance between money spent on treatment (7%), screening (15%), research (24%), and “education” (34%). Two decades ago, it was of utmost importance to get women to get over the fear and the shame and into the doctor’s office, to go public with scars and wigs and hot flashes. But mission accomplished, Komen. Now it’s time to put more weight into stopping the disease before it starts. Dig deep enough into Komen’s financial statements, and you’ll find that of the 24 percent they spend on research, only 15 percent goes to explore how to prevent the disease. Pharmaceutical companies probably do a pretty good job of finding new and better chemo drugs; a nonprofit should put more of its clout into research without a near-term financial payoff.
New insight might also help the board to grok that if they want to maintain a fig leaf of impartiality in the abortion debate and they bring on Jane Abraham—head of the Susan B. Anthony List; the most powerful pro-life funding group around—to their “advocacy alliance” board, they’d better enlist someone like Stephanie Schriock of pro-choice group Emily’s List as a countermeasure. And a board more savvy to opinions outside of Highland Park might persuade Brinker she should sit back on her Neiman Marcus/Chili’s fortune and not pay herself $417,000 a year plus board-approved first-class travel from the donations of jogging bald ladies and their family members.
And for god’s sake, get a better crisis communications team. Or at least a head of communications that has more than 154 followers on Twitter.

“Shrimp lovers don’t need to crash a fancy party to enjoy premium, seasoned-to-perfection shrimp,” announced a Taco Bell press release last year. The chain was heralding its “Pacific Shrimp Taco,” which featured a half-dozen “premium shrimp” for just $2.79.
Marketing campaigns like Taco Bell’s, along with Red Lobster’s periodic “Endless Shrimp” promotions, crystallize shrimp’s transformation from special-treat food to everyday cheap fare. What happened? The answer lies in the rise of factory-scale shrimp farms over the last generation. Twenty years ago, 80 percent of shrimp consumed here came from domestic wild fisheries, with imports supplying the rest. Today, we’ve more than flipped those numbers: the United States imports 90 percent of the shrimp consumed here. We now bring in a staggering 1.2 billion pounds of it annually, mainly from farms in Asia. Between 1995 and 2008, the inflation-adjusted price of wild-caught Gulf shrimp plunged 30 percent.
It turns out, not surprisingly, that plates mounded with cheap shrimp float on a veritable sea of ecological and social trouble. In his excellent 2008 book Bottomfeeder: How to Eat Ethically in a World of Vanishing Seafood, the Canadian journalist Taras Grescoe took a hard look at the Asian operations that supply our shrimp. His conclusion: “The simple fact is, if you’re eating cheap shrimp today, it almost certainly comes from a turbid, pesticide- and antibiotic-filled, virus-laden pond in the tropical climes of one of the world’s poorest nations.”
Lest anyone think otherwise, these factory farms generate poverty in the nations that house them, as Grescoe demonstrates; they privatize and cut down highly productive mangrove forests that once sustained fishing communities, leaving fetid dead zones in their wake.
And now, a new study from University of Oregon researcher J. Boone Kauffman finds that the flattening of Southeast Asian mangrove forests is devastating in another way, too, and not just for the people who have been sustainably living in them for generations. Mangroves, it turns out, are rich stores of biodiversity and also of carbon—and when they’re cleared for farming, that carbon enters the atmosphere as climate-warming gas.
Kaufman estimates that 50 to 60 percent of shrimp farms occupy cleared mangroves, and the shrimp that emerges from them has a carbon footprint 10 times higher than the most notoriously climate-destroying foodstuff I’m aware of: beef from cows raised on cleared Amazon rainforest.
Kaufman calls the shrimp-farming style that prevails in Asia “the equivalent of slash-and-burn agriculture,” because farm operators typically “only last for 5 years or so before the buildup of sludge in the ponds and the acid sulfate soil renders them unfit for shrimp,” he told Science.
Cheap shrimp, like cheap oil, is looking increasingly like a dangerous delusion.

On Thursday, one day after Democratic commentator Hilary Rosen suggested that Ann Romney had “never worked a day in her life” on CNN (she has since apologized), Mitt Romney attempted to portray President Obama as anti-mom by pushing out a statement from Penny Nance, the president of Concerned Women for America.
But the CWA, an Evangelical outfit founded by Beverly LaHaye (wife of Left Behind creator Tim LaHaye), might not be the best messenger if Romney wants to persuade female voters he’s a moderate candidate who has their best interests in mind. In response to Romney, American Bridge, the pro-Obama opposition research outfit, just blasted out a quick cheat-sheet on what, exactly, the Concerned Women for America are so concerned about. (Hint: It’s not equal pay for an equal day’s work.)
Among other things:
This is an agonizingly dumb controversy amplified by Twitter and entirely removed from any substantive public policy debate. But it does reveal a few holes in Romney’s armor going forward. In his push to reverse the damage done by members of his party (himself included) to his reputation with female voters, he’s quickly finding that he’s sorely lacking in plausible surrogates. To defend his position on the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, he brought out Reps Cathy McMorris-Rogers (R-Wash.) and Mary Bono-Mack (R-Cal.)—who both voted against the law. To defend the charge that raising kids is a full-time job, he brought out former First Lady Barbara Bush, hardly the archetypal working mom. They don’t exactly have their finger on the pulse of the American swing voter right now.

Excited chatter filled the halls of Oakland’s Fox Theater with a static noise as neon-and-Chuck-Taylor-clad fans flocked to the merch stand, leaning over the table waving dollar bills, wanting so badly to bear the cross logo of the headlining act, Justice.
Lately, the dynamic French electronica duo, which consists of Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay, has become synonymous with the new age of electronica, wherein playful and infectious dance-disco beats are to be taken in with the sobriety and attitude of heavy metal. “They go straight for the jugular,” Rolling Stone wrote of the group.
Justice first splashed onto the Parisian electronic scene in 2003 with a remix of Simian’s “We Are Your Friends” and since risen to fame, mixing for bigwigs like Britney Spears, N.E.R.D., Fatboy Slim, and Franz Ferdinand. The pair’s first full-length album, 2008’s Cross, drew accolades from within the genre and without. The album’s biggest hit, “D.A.N.C.E.“—a disco track overflowing with pop references—is still ubiquitous, and its colorful video—which combines live action with animation—earned nominations at the Grammys and MTV Video Music Awards. For electronica fans, Justice’s success represents something bigger: the mainstreaming of what was once considered a niche club genre.
“Daft Punk was the first to merge guitar sounds with electronica and they sort of follow in that path, which is fun to watch,” one Justice fan dressed ironically in an air traffic controller vest told me moments before the show. “They also have amazing showmanship.”
Justice was touring their sophomore album, Audio, Video, Disco., appearing in Oakland before an unlikely mix of rock and electronica fans—young and old, die-hard or simply curious. The anticipation swelled right up to the  moment the pair appeared at center stage behind their altar-like DJ booth (note the large fluorescent cross) wedged between walls of Marshall stacks. In greeting, Augé and de Rosnay looked into the crowd and raised their left hands, standing still as a sample of Hendrix’s “Star Spangled Banner” burst forth from the speakers. The crowd roared.
With that, Justice launched into a 90-minute set, starting with the hyperenergetic “Genesis.” From the depths of the pit, it was hard to tell whether we were at a concert or the scene of a Christian revival. (Indeed, the duo is coy about their intentions vis-à-vis religion.) Exactly what Augé and de Rosnay’s were doing up there wasn’t visible—the towering set engulfed their comparatively diminutive frames. But the crowd bought into it, pounding their palms against an invisible wall, without a hint of skepticism. Occasionally, when the steady beats and synthesized power chords grew faster, louder, Auge simply raised his pointer finger in the air, signaling the coming of a new track, or a big climax, and the crowd flailed more wildly, like participants at a collective exorcism.
“It’s like a dream come true to see this in such a small environment, and be up close to Justice, like, this is like the god of electronic music,” said a worshipful fan named Spencer.
While that may sound pathetically over the top, Justice makes drama impossible to escape. There’s the whole Christian thing with the glowing cross and Bible-themed track titles like “Waters of Nazareth” and “Let There Be Light,” the haunting organ sounds and chorales, the way de Rosnay’s cigarettes perch delicately between his lips as his hands go to work. “Justice have carved out an unmistakable sonic signature of discombobulated vocals, rattling, onerous dance beats and brutally distorted melodies produced by synthesizers that sound as though they were martyred just to emit one last growling roar for Justice’s cause,” a blogger wrote of Cross in 2007. The visual drama is magnified by the complete silence of the DJs—who uttered not a word to the crowd the whole time. Still, their sound and presence is tough to deny when you experience them live. “I have never been to a techno concert; I’m a rock concert girl” one newcomer told me. “But I like any kind of music that can imitate my heartbeat.”
Here’s “Civiliation,” from the latest album:

While being attacked as a “traitor” by conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts is enjoying a bit of a boomlet with liberals for voting to uphold most of the Affordable Care Act. But Roberts will soon get a chance to prove himself to conservatives once again, as Politico‘s Josh Gerstein reports:
Roberts has been deeply hostile to the federal government’s efforts to rectify racial inequality. Among his first big cases as chief justice was invalidating a school integration program with the tautological phrase, “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” as though there were any effective way to address racial imbalances without considering race. The high court came within a hair of striking down parts of the Voting Rights Act with the conservative justices issuing an implicit warning that they would not hesitate to do so should another challenge reach them. It seems unlikely that Roberts will give one of the most important pieces of legislation in history, the law that finally guaranteed black Americans’ access to the franchise, another stay of execution. And having voted to uphold the Affordable Care Act, conservative outcomes in these cases would be insulated against liberal criticisms that the court has become politicized.
While conservatives are bashing Roberts, Justice Anthony Kennedy’s star is on the rise on the right thanks to his vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act. An upcoming case over gay marriage may determine whether his improved reputation among conservatives will endure. Republicans have appealed to the Supreme Court to hear a challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act, an issue on which Kennedy, who wrote the 2003 opinion striking down anti-sodomy laws in Lawrence v. Texas, is expected to be the swing vote. Perhaps conservatives think they win either way: If part of DOMA is struck down, religious conservatives will be more likely to flood the ballot box in November; if it’s upheld, then DOMA’s federal definition of marriage that excludes same-sex couples remains the law of the land.
Republicans may believe that Kennedy’s vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act is a sign of a newly permanent allegiance to the court’s right-wing bloc. My colleague Kevin Drum certainly seems to think so, having written that “it’s really not correct to think of Kennedy as a centrist anymore.” It was never really proper to view Kennedy as a centrist rather than a conservative. But Drum is being pessimistic, and Republicans cocky, if they think Kennedy is now a clone of Justice Antonin Scalia, whose recent opinions owe more to Fox News than James Madison. The same judicial philosophy that led Kennedy to join with the Democratic appointees to strike down most of Arizona’s draconian immigration law and find mandatory juvenile life without parole unconstitutional could also lead one to see the individual mandate as an unconstitutional infringement on personal liberty. It could also cause Kennedy to view DOMA as a prime example of federal overreach. Kennedy has always been a conservative with a bit of a libertarian streak.
The cases likely to come before the court in the near future will provide plenty of opportunity for Roberts to restore his standing with conservatives and for Kennedy to remind liberals that he’s no Scalia. As with the Affordable Care Act case, however, it’s anyone’s guess how they’ll actually turn out. Thanks to Roberts’ vote to uphold Obamacare, the high court has a newfound legitimacy that will make it difficult to decry the results as partisan.

The mother and daughter were among 2,500 people participating in a rare event in which US Customs and Border Protection opens a gate in the fence separating El Paso from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, allowing families to briefly reunify. Hugs Not Walls, or Abrazos No Muros, was started in the spring of 2016 by non-profit Border Network for Human Rights. It takes place roughly twice a year, when the water flow of the Rio Grande is cut to a trickle. Families on either side of the border wait in line for hours to embrace for three minutes in the dry riverbed.

For many, the event marks the first—and last—time they will have physical contact with family members for years.
By 7:00 a.m., hundreds of participants had formed a line that curled around El Paso’s unassuming Chihuahuita Park. Over blue shirts required for participation, they bundled in coats and blankets, some toting folding chairs and coolers of lunch. Kids ran around the playground, blue shirts reaching their knees. 800 feet away—across train tracks, the soaring border fence and the shallow Rio Grande—corresponding families gathered at an intersection in Juárez, wearing white shirts.
Miriam, a 27-year-old with bright pink lipstick and an impeccable ponytail, had been anticipating this day ever since she learned about the event on Facebook a couple years ago. “I really want to see my sister—it’s been four years since I saw her,” she explained in Spanish. “She can’t come here because she hasn’t been able to get her visa, and I still haven’t gotten my asylum. I’m fighting to get it.”
At 8:00, the line in the park began to move. Some pushed wheelchairs or strollers as they made their way towards a dirt opening next to the border fence. There, participants waited for hours on plastic chairs: Only 20 families could enter through the gate at a time. Miriam was number 82.
As she sat, Miriam exchanged texts and photos with her sister, aunts, and nieces, who waited in Juárez. Her daughter Mairim, a bubbly first grader, danced, collected rocks, and eagerly took our microphone and played reporter, asking about our family members: What are their names? Where do they live?
Miriam and Mairim (“Miriam” spelled backwards) left Juarez four years ago after receiving threats from a drug cartel. They settled in Oklahoma City, where Miriam sells burritos and tacos out of a food truck.
At 10:30, when families 81 to 100 were called on a loudspeaker, Miriam and Mairim lined up next to the border fence. Behind them was a woman who, with the exception of last year’s Hugs Not Walls, hadn’t seen her 36-year-old son in more than a decade. Ahead of them was mom with blotchy cheeks and teary eyes who hadn’t seen her own mother in eleven years. Mairim played with other kids in line, reaching small hands through the border fence and trying to spot family on the other side. She couldn’t recall meeting the relatives in person, but recognized them from years of video calls.
Hugs Not Walls is a logistical jigsaw puzzle, requiring sign-off from CBP, the International Water Commission, local law enforcement, and federal police in Mexico. It’s also subject to changes in the political climate: Last May, as the number of migrants at the border reached a record high, the event was abruptly cancelled. “Every time we do this, it could be the last one,” explained Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights. “Having children in cages like that—or in a makeshift detention camp—under a bridge, all of that situation created a very tense relationship with CBP,” he added.
Mario Escalante, a US Border Patrol spokesperson, explained that the agency wasn’t able to support last May’s event. Still, Border Patrol maintained a light presence on Saturday, with just a couple of officers on site but with surveillance cameras looking over the event. “For us it’s business as usual: Maintain border security,” said Escalante. A similar event has been taking place at the border between Tijuana and San Diego since 2013.
After what felt to Miriam like an eternity of waiting, volunteers led the group down a concrete levy to the river. Mairim held her mother’s hand as she walked, waving enthusiastically to relatives walking down the levy’s south side. Miriam captured the moment on Facebook live.
One by one, those in blue shirts crossed a narrow, dusty plywood bridge into the dry riverbed on the Mexican side. They were assigned to line up as if starting a race, blue-shirted shoulder to blue-shirted shoulder, waiting for a man with a loudspeaker to tell them to hug. Ten feet away, those with white shirts did the same. Seeing her aunt just steps away, Mairim exclaimed, “Tía!” and broke into a run before the organizer instructed, “Not yet!” For a few tense seconds, the families stood looking at each other, separated only by a bit of cracked dirt.
When the organizer yelled, “Hug!” the wailing was immediate. Families collapsed into each others’ arms. Mairim would later say that she was “so excited to get hugging.” But in the moment, she stood in the middle of a group embrace, weeping. Feet away, other families went through the same routine of hugs, selfies, more hugs, more crying. Cameramen zoomed in on sobbing faces. Along the levy, stoic Mexican police officers looked on. Mairim’s aunt picked her up and wiped the tears from beneath her niece’s pink glasses, joking that she had finally made it to Mexico.
At 10:53, the organizer yelled, “Time’s up!” and, after final hugs, lines formed again. Blue shirts walked up the levy walkway to El Paso as white shirts walked up the levy to Juárez. Many participants looked gutted and dazed, like they had just run a marathon. “Bye, Tía!” Mairim yelled as she wearily waved to her family. “I love you!”
A few hours later, the mother and daughter would board a bus for Oklahoma City. But first, the pair sat once again on the plastic chairs, waiting for permission to leave. Miriam couldn’t stop smiling. She wished she had more time with family, she said, but she was thankful for those three minutes. Sitting next to her mom, a resigned Mairim stared down at her lap, lips quivering.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The outrage and disappointment from advocates and candidates was immediate: They argued that what could be considered the most important issue facing any president should not be given short shrift.
In April, we were the first media outlet to write about the possibility of a debate on climate change. The DNC justified their position against one by arguing that there would be no single-issue debates at all. But the campaign for a climate debate remained strong, given the long history of the presidential debate moderators paying little attention to the issue. When there were still 25 Democratic presidential hopefuls, I contacted all of them asking if they would support such a debate and nearly all said they would.
Then Washington Governor Jay Inslee, whose entire campaign was focused on addressing climate change, told us he was considering defying the DNC anyway. (He didn’t.) It got us thinking how Mother Jones and The Climate Desk, a collaboration of 18 national and regional outlets, could focus the conversation around the climate crisis. As it turns out, our partners at The Weather Channel also had been wondering the same thing.
Soon other news outlets announced plans for town halls and other forums, but we figured we should be doubling down on our strengths to do something a little different. We wanted to avoid the predictable approach, and instead meet the candidates in communities they chose that had been impacted by climate change, talking to them there with Weather Channel meteorologists and Climate Desk reporters about how they’d address the climate crisis, and have more thoughtful, even personal, conversations. The six Democrats and three Republicans selected places that had directly experienced flooding, hurricanes, wildfires, and other impacts of extreme weather.
Too often politicians discuss climate change as if it is some problem that looms in the future, often reflecting on what this will mean for their grandchildren. And they’re usually doing so in front of crowds indoors, at a podium or on a stage. We wanted to break past the stale talking points and give the candidates a chance to explore the issue through their proposed plans, but also through storytelling.
We asked the top frontrunners to participate, and six Democrats and three Republicans thought that this was a good idea. We met with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Beto O’Rourke before he stepped down. The Weather Channel interviewed Republican presidential hopefuls, too, including ex-Massachusetts governor William Weld, former Illinois Congressman Joe Walsh, and former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford.
President Donald Trump was also invited, as was former Vice President Joe Biden.
The project took us to the floodplains of Charleston, South Carolina; South Bend, Indiana; and Dubuque, Iowa, as well as Paradise, California, which was devastated by the Camp Fire almost exactly a year ago. We talked about environmental justice in Anacostia, a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., and sea-level rise in Boston.
Five months later, The Weather Channel has used these interviews to put together a one-hour primetime special, “2020: The Race to Save the Planet”, which will air Thursday, November 7 at 8 p.m. ET. Following the show, there will be a Q&A with the Weather Channel’s Dr. Rick Knabb and Jamilah King from Mother Jones. In addition to The Weather Channel’s program, we’ve reported stories along the way, and on Wednesday, The Mother Jones Podcast I will join Dr. Rick Knabb to discuss the candidates and some of the major takeaways.
We’ve learned a few things from this project. Climate change is personal, and it’s also varied. Every candidate has some individual experience and perspective that they bring to confronting the effects of this phenomenon. Another lesson has to do with covering the climate crisis generally: The best journalism to address a story of this scale often should be collaborative—something we anticipate doing more of with our Climate Desk partners.
Watch the promo here:

Now, Lindsey Graham Admits He’s Not Bothering to Look for One.",Edwin Rios,MotherJones,Impeachapalooza,"Even in the face of damning testimony and an arguably even more damning reversal from Gordon Sondland, leading Senate Republicans are still in denial: None of what is happening in the impeachment investigation means anything, how dare you ask such a dumb question, and even if it did, they wouldn’t know because they don’t know what you’re talking about.
This line of alternate-reality thinking is happening more and more frequently as things look increasingly dire for the president.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) bluntly told reporters that the president would be acquitted if an impeachment trial took place today. (So, what happened to due process?)

And while that’s not exactly shocking from McConnell, this one is a bit more fun: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he has simply “written the whole process off” and admits he’s refused to read any of the testimonies that have been publicly released this week—testimony that pretty clearly seems to back the idea that administration officials indeed engaged in a quid pro quo. He called it a “bunch of B.S.”

On Twitter, folks were quick to point out that, just a couple of weeks ago, Graham opted for the idea that evidence of a quid pro quo by the president simply didn’t exist.

The world will endure “untold human suffering” if humans don’t dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, argue Oregon State University’s William J. Ripple and Christopher Wolf—along with a coalition of scientists from around the world—in a paper published today in BioScience. The effects include frequent severe weather events such as hurricanes and wildfires, and the potential for portions of the earth to become uninhabitable if warming passes a “tipping point” and becomes irreversible.
“Climate change has arrived and is accelerating faster than many scientists expected,” says Ripple, who in 2017 published a warning to humanity about global environmental problems which was signed by more than 15,000 scientists from 184 countries. “Despite 40 years of major global negotiations, we have continued to conduct business as usual and have failed to address this crisis.”
Their paper identifies a series of climate change “vital signs”—such as carbon dioxide emissions, which rose in 2018 for the first time in four years—intended to “help people understand the magnitude of the problem that we’re facing,” according to Ripple, the lead author of the study.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But the country’s hackers had been quite active and well known in some communities well before, staging a series of increasingly brazen and destructive attacks against regional rivals, including Estonia, Georgia, and Ukraine.  Even after 2016, most Americans are probably not aware of the extent to which such Russian operations remain a threat. A devastating cyber attack launched on Ukraine in 2017 ended up infecting business networks around the world and costing billions in damages, crippling hospitals—including in the US.
In his just-released book “Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin’s Most Dangerous Hackers,” Andy Greenberg of Wired walks readers through the discovery of Sandworm, the name given to the small group of Russian military hackers thought to be behind the high-profile attacks, explaining that they sometimes launched them for the pettiest of reasons. We caught up with Greenberg to talk about what makes Russian hackers distinct, his nightmare hypothetical attack, and how things are likely to get worse before they get better.
Why should people who don’t necessarily follow the tech world or cybersecurity pay attention to this book?
This is the first story of a real cyber war. I think people are familiar with this idea of cyber war as like this phenomenon where hackers could someday reach into the critical infrastructure of civilians’ lives and break the fundamental machines that we depend on. But those have always been hypothetical stories, like, ‘What if hackers could turn off the power? What if hackers could destroy hundreds of thousands of computers? Could they take down hospitals? Could they take down industrial control systems and manufacturing supply chains?’ This is the first story about what that actually looks like. It did happen and it has not gotten the attention that I think it deserves for something that’s such a real threat to the way that we live.
This is a story about threats to the technology that underpins our lives. But also, it’s a it’s a story about real victims of attacks that have already taken place. I feel like those victims deserve to have their stories told and the perpetrators deserve to be brought into the light.
Certain points in this book remind me of what it was like in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, where the majority of civil infrastructure was down.
I would not argue that anything that Sandworm inflicted is as serious as what happened in Puerto Rico. We have not yet seen a cyber attack that has been confirmed to have taken a human life, not to mention thousands. But I mentioned Puerto Rico in the introduction of the book. We could see Puerto Rico-like situations that are actually purposefully caused by digital attackers. Imagine if combined with [the devastation and a downed power grid] there was also a malicious adversary working against your recovery. This is what it could look like in the future.
I tell the story near the end of the book of this “Black Start” exercise by DARPA. That was about trying to recover the power grid when you still have hackers infiltrating it. I found it very disturbing to hear the stories from those engineers of the days and days that they worked to bring this little, very simple test grid back online as unseen hands just pulled it down again and again.
It is not a hypothetical book, but there are still hypotheticals that you can chart out from what has already happened. And this case of a cyber-physical attack that is persistent and incurable, like a malevolent force, just sticks around and keeps tearing everything down again. That’s the nightmare that I think still remains a scary future hypothetical.
What do you think makes the Russian approach to hacking distinct from the Chinese approach or the Iranian approach or the Israeli approach to the American approach?
The US does very aggressive disruption operations by Cyber Command, but very rarely and with a lot of targeting. For the most part, what the US does is just vast espionage—very stealthy and kind of traditional. The Chinese similarly seem to be largely focused on espionage, which has included very traditional and sometimes nonetheless devastating spying on American government agencies, but also less traditional spying on commercial entities in the US and stealing IP, which is sort of outside of the rules. I should mention that they spy on their citizens, their own people, including the Uighurs and Tibetans, in terribly oppressive ways. But for the most part, that’s just spying. What distinguishes Russia among these great powers of hacking is that they are at that same level of sophistication and they’re willing to just be insanely reckless and aggressive.
I’m sure that the NSA and Cyber Command have built incredibly innovative ways to disrupt and destroy digital systems. They have been incredibly restrained and only attacked rare targets and usually ones associated with foreign militaries.
But Russia seems to carry out these kind of scorched earth cyber war actions that effect turning off the power to hundreds of thousands of civilians, or releasing a piece of malware like NotPetya that kind of carpet bombs a country and then spreads to a dozen major multinationals and it inflicts hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to each one of them, and even to Russian victims just as collateral damage. They seem to err on the side of just doing it whenever they think of some new malicious invention.
I don’t consider spying or even hacking and leaking operations as an “attack.” But Russia does attack and Sandworm, in particular, has carried out one unprecedented attack after another. And that’s what distinguishes them.
The bulk of this takes place during the Obama years, and into the Trump administration. How has the US government responded to Sandworm attacks?
Part of the story of the book is how both administrations failed, I believe, to appropriately respond and deter and restrain this group as its attacks escalated and escalated. The Obama administration did take a hard line against a lot of state sponsored hackers. It called out the Iranians who attacked US banks. It called out the North Koreans who attacked Sony and the Russians who attacked the US election, ultimately.
But it seemed to be reluctant to say anything about what was happening in Ukraine. Despite the fact that the Obama administration called out Russia for its physical invasion of Ukraine, once it had sanctioned Russia for that physical invasion it seemed to treat everything else that happens digitally in the country as a freebie, and never said anything about even the first ever blackouts that the hackers carried out.
Many of the researchers that follow this were hoping that the US government would after the first blackout in 2015, for instance, put out a statement or give some kind of speech that said, “Hey, even though Ukraine is not a NATO state, and even though there’s a physical war happening here, it’s just not okay to turn off the power to civilians. This has happened for the first time, and we don’t like it and cut it out.” Which is pretty much exactly the kind of language that Michael Daniel, the cyber coordinator for Obama, said that he’d sent to Russia about the election meddling. But they were never sent that message about blackout attacks. That was, I think, the Obama administration’s failure.
But the second blackout attack, although it occurred in last days of the Obama administration, it was really up to the Trump administration to respond to that. And they didn’t say anything, despite even more evidence that this was Russia carrying out a sustained campaign of critical infrastructure attacks against Ukraine.
Both administrations just allow this to unfold and allow Russia to attack Ukraine with impunity. We wrote a cover story about how what was happening to Ukraine would, sooner or later, spill out to the rest of the world. And then that happens.
The day that our story hit newsstands is when NotPetya hits, this malware released by Sandsworm that was intended to hit Ukraine. But it instantly spread to the rest of the world and costs $10 billion dollars of damage and took out American hospitals and cost Merck [hundreds of millions]. We waited until this series of attacks hit us to say anything, and even then it took eight months for the Trump administration to actually get out a statement even saying that Russia did this and that is not okay.
What does your reporting tell you about where we’re heading and what’s to come in the next few years?
Every trendline, for the most part, seems like it’s going in the wrong direction. We’ve seen one unprecedented thing after another, largely carried out by Russia and even more specifically by this one group of GRU [military intelligence] hackers. We’ve seen the first blackout and then the second more advanced one, we saw the kind of most concerted efforts at election interference. We have seen the worst disruptive cyber attack in history hit the entire global internet. And in 2018 we saw in some ways the most deceptive cyber attack hit the 2018 Winter Olympics, which was also tied back to the GRU. So it seems like this evolution of attacks is not stopping and that and you can see that just in the behavior of the GRU alone. So none of that looks good.
One more point is that we see an evolution of the GRU’s adventurism globally. The things that they once confined to Ukraine, like these targeted disruptive attacks, they used against the opening ceremony of the Olympics, which was a truly global event attended by all these heads of states. So it’s not like it this is all just collateral damage from their attempts to attack their direct neighbors. The GRU seems willing to use its disruptive acts of, in some ways, digital terrorism, against anyone in the world when they have some petty reason.
I don’t know what the GRU has been up to for the last year, but these things come to light long after the groundwork for them has been laid, and often we only understand the severity of these things, months or even years later. I would not want to make the prediction that we’ve seen the worst of it.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Trump’s EPA Just Made it Even Harder to Control.,Will Peischel,MotherJones,Environment,"Renewable energy is taking up more of the United States’ power grid, and despite the best efforts of the Trump administration, the days of coal’s dominance appear to be numbered. Nonetheless, the administration continues to try and reverse the industry’s decline and crisis of solvency by enacting policies as if fossil fuels were the still an engine of America’s economic future. This week brought another example: The EPA announced plans to loosen two Obama-era rules that dictate how coal-burning power plants should dispose of their toxic waste, known as coal ash. A typical plant produces more than 125,000 tons of coal ash every year.
The proposal would unravel previous guidelines in two ways: First, by easing regulations on what pollutants coal plants can dump, and then by changing the standards for the containment systems they dump that waste into. Both changes largely involve delaying deadlines for coal mines to reach regulatory compliance. Larissa Liebmann, an attorney with the clean water advocacy group Waterkeeper Alliance points out that plants are getting two additional years to cut down on some waste waters they produce, and other filtration requirements would become completely voluntary. As for waste storage, coal companies could have up to eight years to line their storage ponds with material approved under regulatory guidelines, a jump from 2020 to 2028.
The Washington Post’s Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis reported:
This rule change trades away increased costs for the coal companies for higher toxic chemical exposure in communities from the groundwater near coal-burning plants. By giving fossil fuels companies longer to act, more contaminants will inevitably be released into the environment.  Liebmann, who was disappointed but not surprised by the new ruling, says this foot-dragging simply reveals how the administration prioritizes its constituents.
“The administration put coal ahead of the public’s health and the health of our waterways,” she says. “We think these moves will put communities at risk from the toxic pollutants of coal ash, and it’s doing it to save coal companies’ money.”
She notes that of all those toxic pollutants—which include arsenic, lead, and mercury—selenium is the most serious. It’s a byproduct of coal ash that can cause neurological problems, paralysis, and even death when ingested in high amounts. As part of a 2010 report from Physicians for Social Responsibility and Earth Justice, scientists collected drinking water samples collected near coal ash containment sites. Some had selenium levels that were sometimes 580 times higher than the federal drinking water standard.
“Rollbacks will result in more selenium discharges,” she says, “so that’s one thing we’re looking at right now.”
The irony here is that, in part, the move by the EPA is the result of a 2018 court victory by climate activists. In 2015, when the EPA rewrote a number of guidelines on coal ash ponds—a common vessel to store coal plan runoff—the coal industry and environmental advocacy groups quickly took the EPA the court; the former argued the new rules went too far, the latter said they didn’t go far enough. The EPA rules had allowed coal ash ponds to use a clay-based lining, which was questionably effective. In some cases, ponds could go without lining at all. Environmental groups suggested this threatened public health and the environment.
In August of last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed. The court ordered coal companies to alter their facilities to meet the court-ordered standards, or shut down. In part, this new EPA plan is designed to provide coal companies a more generous window for meeting those deadlines. Liebmann says that the new deadlines the EPA is giving bad actors undoes any sense of victory activists once enjoyed. This is compounded by the fact that the overwhelming majority of coal ash ponds already contaminate the surrounding groundwater. And the worst offenders now have much more time to continue doing so.
“The industry often benefits from EPA dragging its feet on these things,” she says, “and on that, it has a lot of leeway to do so.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled a wide-ranging plan Tuesday to improve care for America’s veterans, active-duty service members, and their families, proposing to end discrimination toward LGBTQ, immigrant, and HIV-positive troops while substantially increasing the number of staff employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Her campaign’s suite of ideas comprise Warren’s most comprehensive statement yet of how she would approach the persistent problems ailing Americans in uniform, including unsafe housing, unreliable health care, and mental illness. But the plan includes few details on how much it will cost or how the burden will be split between the Pentagon and VA.
“All three of my brothers served, so I know the responsibility we have to our service members, military families, and veterans,” she wrote in a Medium post introducing the plan. “I will honor our troops not only by executing sound military strategy, but also by caring for our veterans after they take off the uniform.”
Since joining the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2017, Warren has increasingly made reforming the Defense Department a key part of her policy platform. Her campaign has already released plans to curb the influence of defense contractors and decrease the military’s carbon footprint, but Tuesday’s policy rollout addresses veterans’ issues that have stymied presidents from both parties.
Among Warren’s top priorities is mental illness, a problem that has grown more urgent as suicide rates among active-duty personnel reached historic highs last year and veterans remain twice as likely to die by suicide as civilians. Warren vowed to cut veteran suicides in half within her first term. To do so, she proposes targeted research into the causes of suicide and hiring more mental health specialists at VA hospitals.
Will Goodwin, a US Army veteran and director of government relations for VoteVets, a progressive advocacy group, says Warren’s plan crucially did not limit its focus to just the VA, but covered issues like military housing and the scourge of America’s endless wars, which formally fall under the purview of the Defense Department but still affect how long veterans are deployed and how they transition to civilian life. “Military family readiness is hugely important to that,” he says. “The more time people spend away from their families can affect their transition to civilian life afterward.”
For military families, Warren would invest in child care centers at military bases and create a bill of rights for tenants of military housing. She would also reimburse military spouses for costs associated with changing jobs when their partners move between bases. Her plan calls for working with community nonprofits to treat veterans living with addiction and investing in programs to connect veterans with jobs and education through the GI Bill. Her campaign would not specify how much these new policies would cost, but in some cases, existing Warren policy ideas would just be extended to veterans. She already supports canceling student loan debt and making public college free, moves that should help veterans seeking higher education after leaving military service. But her plan would also empower the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau to ensure that veterans aren’t cheated or defrauded out of their GI benefits.
Many planks of her plan for veterans and active-duty service members are popular among other congressional Democrats. Echoing a plan originally pitched by fellow Senate Armed Services Committee member Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Warren supports removing sexual assault cases from the military chain of command and ensuring that survivors who come forward receive a “competent, empowered” advocate on their behalf. She also wants sexual harassment and the distribution of revenge pornography to be standalone crimes under military law.
In her most direct shot at President Donald Trump, Warren says she would reverse the Pentagon’s ban on transgender service members on her first day in office and ensure that service members living with HIV can “serve and deploy.” Originally decreed by tweet in July 2017, Trump’s transgender ban surprised Pentagon leaders and put the status of thousands of transgender service members in jeopardy. In another pointed rejection of Trump policy, Warren promises to recruit immigrants with “specialized skills or language abilities” into the military and ensure that those who serve have an easier path to naturalization. Trump’s strict immigration policies have stymied the Pentagon’s recruitment of immigrant enlistees even led to the possibility of deportation for some active-duty troops.
Perhaps the most difficult problem Warren addresses is mismanagement at the Department of Veterans Affairs, one of the few areas left in Washington where politicians of both parties are united in their outrage. The two veterans still in the Democratic primary, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) have also been critical of VA hospitals, which are plagued by lengthy wait times and preventable patient deaths. Neither candidate has unveiled a comparable policy plan for veterans yet, but in August, Buttigieg pledged to recruit more VA clinicians by increasing their pay and “slashing red tape.”
But Warren, like Buttigieg and Gabbard, rejects the Trump administration’s policy to privatize more VA health care, even as she acknowledges the need to be “clear-eyed” about leadership issues at the VA. “The truth is that care provided by VA outperforms care at non-VA hospitals, as multiple studies have shown,” Warren writes. Her campaign promises to fill nearly 50,000 staff vacancies and upgrade outdated infrastructure and medical equipment without adopting Trump’s shift of some VA activities the private sector.
Trump’s oversight of the VA has been marked by enthusiastic rhetoric but an inconsistent, occasionally chaotic management style. After installing hospital administrator David Shulkin as secretary of veterans affairs, Trump removed him for opposing the administration’s privatization plan, which had been promoted internally by three influential Trump associates whom ProPublica dubbed the “shadow rulers” of the VA. Trump’s first choice to succeed Shulkin was his White House doctor, who withdrew from consideration after reports of workplace misconduct. A Pentagon appointee, Robert Wilkie, was later confirmed to head the VA.
“A lot of this boils down to competent administration,” Goodwin says. “It’s a matter of stability and continuity paired with the proper leadership.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Here goes.
Elizabeth Warren announced her Medicare for All plan last week, and since we’re liberals we immediately jumped on it, demanded more details, deconstructed it, analyzed its benefits, and blue-penciled its costs and funding sources. There’s no help for that. As the Geico ad says: we’re liberals, it’s what we do.
Fine. But we all recognize that it doesn’t matter, don’t we? For starters, to put her plan in place we’d need to win the presidency and the Senate, and that’s a tough task. Then we’d need to eliminate the filibuster, which is very, very unlikely since a few Democrats have already said they wouldn’t join in.
But suppose we miraculously do all that. Actual legislation depends mostly on the Senate, not on President Warren or Speaker Pelosi. This means that health care legislation can’t be more progressive than the 50th most liberal senator, which is likely to be someone like Joe Manchin or Doug Jones. So even in the best case we won’t get the M4A plan that Warren is campaigning on. Not even close.
What this means is that these M4A plans shouldn’t be treated like real legislation to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office. Rather, they should be treated like Republican tax cut proposals. Nobody bothers to analyze them (except for liberal think tanks, natch) because no one takes them seriously. They are meant merely as markers to show where your heart is. A weak plan shows that you’re a RINO. A big tax cut shows you’re a strong conservative. And a ridiculous plan shows that you’re a lunatic—which might or might not be a good thing depending on the mood of the electorate.
So forget the details. Warren and Sanders are deliberately selling themselves as lunatics. Their plans mean nothing except that they are true blue liberals. Don’t try to read any more than that into them. Biden and Buttigieg and Booker are demonstrating that they’re part of the mainstream Obama wing of the party. And Amy Klobuchar is . . . not trying to demonstrate her DINO credentials, but she’s close.
Bottom line: stop sweating the details. Candidate plans aren’t meant to pencil out with a lot of precision. They’re rough drafts designed to show where their hearts are at. Smart analysts will mostly take them that way.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In fact, why have I been blogging and reading all night?
You may recall that back in 2018 I took 8mg of Dexamethasone once a week. It kept me up all night, and I mostly used those nights to take pictures and to write idiosyncratic explanations of general relativity. In January I rebelled and stopped taking the dex. It took two months to wear off, but by March I felt pretty good—which is to say, normal. In May I took a trip to the Blue Ridge Parkway.
Sadly, my cancer load increased, and in July I restarted the dex along with a new drug. In August I was casting around for a trip to take before the dex kicked in, and that’s when I went to Colombia.
Now, my doctor and I had agreed on an experiment: instead of 8mg of dex once a week, I would take 4mg of dex twice a week. This might allow me to sleep on dex nights and would have milder side effects on the other days.
The first part worked: with a big slug of Ambien in hand, I could manage 5-6 hours of sleep. Not bad. The second part was a failure. Not only were the side effects just as bad—fatigue, lots of napping, etc.—but they pretty much lasted all week. There was no break from feeling lousy.
So yesterday I went back to the old regime: 8mg of dex on Monday. So far I’ve noticed two things: I’ve been more talkative than usual and I was up all night despite taking the strongest Ambien I have. I expected that. So I’ll ditch the Ambien completely and just become a talkative night owl on Mondays. I will still suffer the side effects, of course, but hopefully they will last two days, maybe three at most, and I will have at least Thursday-Monday to feel relatively normal.

The Washington, DC-based free expression and research nonprofit has been studying internet freedom since 2009. This year’s report surveyed 65 countries covering the vast majority of the world’s internet users, seeking to measure factors including legal safeguards for free expression, the protection of internet users’ rights to privacy, and the ability to transmit news and political information.
Mike Abramowitz, the president of Freedom House, told reporters that this year’s report found two key themes: government and populist movements using social media platforms to “manipulate elections on a grand scale, alongside government use of “technology to monitor their own citizens on an unprecedented scale.”
While internet-based disinformation efforts are nothing new, Abramowitz said, they “have reached a new zenith and sophistication,” occurring not only in dictatorships but “increasingly in democracies” as well. “Perhaps most alarming is how populist leaders and far-right groups have grown adept not only at creating viral disinformation, but also at building and coordinating networks that disseminate it,” he said. “In many cases, unscrupulous candidates and their supporters are manufacturing their own echo chambers from scratch.”
Repressive governments in China, Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia “are also stepping up efforts to influence elections outside their own borders,” he said.
Equally troubling is governments’ increasing use of the internet and digital media to monitor their own citizens. “Three billion people are living under social media monitoring by their governments,” Abramowitz said, which employ artificial intelligence and other means to gather personal data and identify perceived threats and “silence opposition.” This is particularly disturbing, he added, given its tendency to lead to real-world consequences: In 47 of the 65 countries assessed, people had been arrested for non-violent online expression—a record number.
It might be easy to dismiss these problems as belonging to foreign governments, but Abramowitz pointed out that the social media platforms that undergird the growing disinformation and surveillance dystopia are largely American companies, arguing that “the US bears a special responsibility for addressing these threats to internet freedom.” Such action, he said, “is the only way to stop the internet from becoming a trojan horse for tyranny and oppression.”
Adrian Shahbaz, who co-authored the report with Allie Funk, said the biggest declines in internet freedom were in Sudan and Kazakhstan, followed by Brazil, Bangladesh, and Zimbabwe. China, well known for its oppressive approach to the internet, still ranks as the world’s worst abuser of internet freedom, based partly on crackdowns launched ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and in response to anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
He noted that the US has its own issues, with law enforcement agencies’ increasing use of social media monitoring and warrantless searches of travelers’ devices, and widespread disinformation efforts around the 2018 midterm elections, “with both domestic and foreign actors manipulating content for political purposes,” with similar activity gearing up for 2020.
The report analyzes tactics deployed in countries during recent elections, finding  three broad categories of interference: informational, technical, and legal.
Shabaz called on the US congress and tech companies increase transparency around paid content, audit standards, and regulation of social media surveillance tools, and pointed to new laws in Washington, Illinois, and California, arguing that states could help drive policy in the face of Republican resistance to new federal laws designed to protect elections.
“I do think that it might be a slow and difficult process but,” Shabaz added, “states can be a leader in demonstrating that reforms to the law are actually possible and can play a positive role in securing elections.”

A month before a married couple allegedly gunned down two police officers and a bystander in Las Vegas, suspect Jerad Miller went on Facebook looking for a gun. Any gun would do, Miller wrote, as long as it worked on the “evil tyrant bastards.”
On May 8, Miller posted the following on Facebook:
Facebook users soon chimed in to help Miller with his request. One person replied, “ak47.” A second asked, “What happened to urs?” A third offered, “What are you looking for.”
Miller replied, “Doesn’t matter, bolt action, semi, anything that can reach out and touch evil tyrant bastards. Idc [I don’t care] if its a hundred dollar pink 22 rifle lol.”
A fourth person chimed in that the “Gun store has plenty of rifles.” Miller replied, “We broke bro, believe me if we had the money we would be at some of the best gun stores in the country buying what we need. Idc if its a ww2 m4 lol. something for when they call us terrorists, we can defend ourselves.”
A fifth person recognized that the conversation was entering potentially illegal territory, and recommended that Miller hide his identity. “You and I both know that you shouldn’t be using Facebook for this. Get yourself a tor router and be anonymous like the constitution always intended,” the person wrote. Miller replied, “lol im just fucking around.”
But according to authorities, Miller wasn’t “just fucking around”—five people, including Miller and his wife, Amanda, are now dead. While we don’t know if the Millers were successful in obtaining any guns through Facebook, the fact that the post is still up raises questions about how well Facebook’s effort to crack down on illegal gun sales is working. In March, the social network announced that it would start deleting posts that offer to buy or sell guns without background checks. At the time, it wasn’t clear how Facebook planned to enforce the new guidelines.  (As of 2012, Miller and his wife were not allowed to own guns because of his criminal record, according to Miller’s post on the conspiracy-peddling website, Infowars.)
“We are sickened to learn that the Las Vegas shooter attempted to obtain a rifle through Facebook. The post has remained live on Facebook for a month, demonstrating the inadequacy of Facebook’s gun policy,” said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, in a statement. “Facebook continues to make it too easy for dangerous people to find guns and should prohibit gun sales outright.”
In a statement sent to Buzzfeed, a Facebook spokesperson said: “While this online discussion is certainly disturbing in light of recent events, we have not been made aware of any connection to an actual gun transaction offline.”

The bill in question, HB 1127, would make Florida women seeking abortions subject to both an ultrasound and a doctor’s detailed description of what’s in there.  I’m guessing the doctor might even be forced to—gasp!—use the word “uterus” as he or she performs the ultrasound.
“How do you ban the word ‘uterus’ at the same time you’re debating a bill that would force women to look at a picture of their uterus?” asks Stephanie Kunkel, executive director of the Florida Association of Planned Parenthood Affiliates.
Florida’s bill, which has been introduced in both the state House and the Senate, is much like sonogram bills that other states have considered. From the House version of the bill:
A woman can sign a waiver that allows her to avoid viewing the ultrasound, but she will still have to listen to the doctor describe it.
The bill creates an exception for women who are the victims of rape, incest, domestic violence, or human trafficking, but only if the woman produces a copy of a restraining order, police report, medical record, or other court order proving she is exempted. Providing “documentation” for these crimes is often quite difficult. A woman would also be excused from the ultrasound if she has a serious medical condition that required an abortion to prevent “the risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”
The bill has already passed through one Senate committee and one House committee, and additional committees in both chambers are expected to debate and approve it this week. Similar bills have passed in the Florida House every year since 2007, Kunkel says. The Senate also approved a similar measure in 2010, but then-Gov. Charlie Crist (R) vetoed it, arguing that it “places an inappropriate burden on women seeking to terminate pregnancy.” But with Republicans in control of both the House and Senate and a new, more conservative governor, Rick Scott, in office, advocates for abortion rights fear that the ultrasound bill will become law in 2011.
There are a total of 18 bills in the Florida legislature this year that would limit abortion access. Since the Speaker doesn’t want to hear the Part of the Woman’s Body Which Cannot Be Named in debates, abortion rights advocates in Florida argue that he should probably not be making laws that affect it. “If the speaker can’t bear to hear or say the word ‘uterus,’ he shouldn’t be legislating it,” Kunkel says.

At bases around the world, the military has already begun training service members to tolerate gay and lesbian colleagues’ displays of affection, and to lay off the “gay bar” jokes…and yet this week, it still barred a standout former Army cadet from rejoining the ranks, because her lesbianism breaks the existing rules. The developments show how current and aspiring LGBT service members can continue to expect uneven treatment until Pentagon leaders dot the i’s and cross the t’s on a policy change that’s already sailed through Congress.
Advances are being made, sort of. The AP notes that, since March, thousands of troops have already undergone instruction on how to work congenially with gay colleagues:
The Marines are also reminding their charges that they’re still entitled to think homosexuality is wrong; they just can’t impose that dictum on their brothers and sisters in uniform. “These changes are about policy,” their guidebook states. “The policy is about adherence to orders and behavior, and not about beliefs.”
And yet, the case of Cadet Katie Miller—which may be familiar to Mother Jones readers—shows that the policy is in limbo, and out service members are still out of luck in the foreseeable future.
Last summer, exasperated with the military’s Don’t Ask Don’t Tell policy, Miller came out as a lesbian, resigned her US Military Academy appointment, and transferred to Yale. “I intend for my resignation to offer a concrete example of the consequences of a failed law and social policy,” she wrote. And she made it clear that once DADT was dead, she’d happily rejoin the service. Congress repealed the 1993 policy late last year, and Miller applied for readmission to West Point. Campus officials confirmed this week that she’d been rejected.
It’s not that the Army didn’t want Miller in uniform—given her record of achievements in two years at West Point, (ninth in her class of 1,100, top-notch athlete, peer leader), who wouldn’t? It’s just that gays still can’t serve openly until the military’s brass announce that their Don’t Ask Don’t Tell repeal process is done:
So when will that be?
West Point couldn’t really have been expected to rule differently on Miller’s application, given the constraints of the current policy. But until the military bureaucracy reacquaints itself with the 21st century—and it congressional mandate—soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen will be stuck in a bizarro loop where gay smooches are to be tolerated, but high-performing gay colleagues are nowhere to be found.

	Politics","Declaring that it is “passionate” about the safety of young drivers, Ford is sponsoring clinics at US high schools, urging teens to heed traffic laws and avoid distractions behind the wheel. The auto giant, as part of its “Driving Skills for Life” program, also recently awarded $25,000 to students who created the best music video about the hazards of distracted driving.
BMW, likewise, has launched “Don’t Txt & Drive,” a series of ads dramatizing the risks of distracted driving. And the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry trade group, is teaming with the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons on a similar campaign.
With efforts like these, automakers are positioning themselves as leaders in the fight against distracted driving, a problem federal authorities estimate caused 5,474 deaths in 2009—including 995 from using cell phones. Yet even as they urge drivers to focus on the road, these same companies are packing their new models with cutting-edge infotainment systems that encourage drivers to multitask.
Ford’s SYNC system, for instance, let drivers use voice commands and touch screens to make and receive calls, listen to texts, and choose from a menu of replies. BMW’s Connected Drive provides calling, email, and text read-backs, displaying email subject lines on a screen. General Motors struts its stuff in this 30-second Super Bowl spot, which features a young Chevy owner checking his first date’s Facebook status.

Auto execs are counting heavily on these arresting high-tech features to boost sales to the young and the hip. David Mondragon, president of Ford Canada, put it bluntly. “The biggest turnoff to a twentysomething consumer is to put their life on hold when they sit in a car,” he said in a speech to the Canadian Marketing Association, according to an account in the Globe and Mail.
“And what does it mean to put their life on hold?” Mondragon continued. “To get disconnected when they get in the car, to have a system that will not allow you to sit there and email, read your BlackBerry, talk on the phone. So you have to have a seamless transition from your home to your transportation device, to your workspace. Or to your play space.” (Mondragon, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed.)
All of this, naturally, has safety officials worried. “I’m not in the business of helping people tweet better,” groused David Strickland, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a speech at a national conference in June. NHTSA’s official position, backed by a body of research, is that there are three types of distraction: visual, manual, and cognitive. That is, even when a motorist is looking straight ahead, the cognitive demands of a phone conversation may cause “inattention blindness,” or a failure to respond to visual cues, because the mind is “somewhere else.”
The evidence includes a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety that found that drivers are four times more likely to crash when they are talking on the phone, even when using a hands-free device.
Researchers at the University of Utah, meanwhile, have found that cellphone conversations slow drivers’ reactions as much as having a blood alcohol level at the legal limit of .08 percent. Moreover, in some fatal crashes, there is anecdotal evidence that drivers were simply talking—not dialing or groping for their phones.
With their public service campaigns highlighting distracted driving, critics say, automakers are trying to keep regulators at bay. “The best defense is a good offense,” notes Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, DC. “One has to watch what auto companies do, versus what they say.”
Telling customers to turn off their devices is a lost cause, industry officials insist. So they have opted to make the roads safer by offering built-in connections that are simpler and less distracting to use than a smart phone. “Given that the driver has decided they are going to do something, it’s better to be doing it with their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel,” explains Louis Tijerina, a senior technical specialist with Ford.
Indeed, “eyes on the road, hands on the wheel,” has become something of an industry mantra—for Ford in particular. More than a marketing slogan, it presents a fundamental challenge to the long-held precept that distraction involves not only the eyes and the hands, but the mind.
The automakers draw their ammunition from competing research, largely studies by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, which GM and Ford recently hired to compare their built-in systems with portable devices in terms of driver safety. (The built-ins prevailed, and the companies issued press releases touting the results.)
The institute is a pioneer of so-called naturalistic studies, wherein cameras and sensors are mounted in vehicles to record what drivers were doing at the time of crashes, near-crashes, or lesser incidents such as veering out of their lane. While visual and manual tasks can be serious distractions, its studies have concluded, there is little crash risk so long as drivers keep their eyes on the road, “regardless of any other ‘cognitive demand,'” as one paper put it.
Nearly the entire risk, according to the institute’s researchers, stems from dialing, texting, or reaching for the gadget—almost none of it comes from talking. One institute study of commercial truck and bus drivers even concluded that wireless conversations had a “protective effect.”
To suggest “there’s no such thing as cognitive distraction…is obviously not right,” counters David Strayer, a University of Utah researcher and coauthor of the study equating cell-phone use with drunk driving. “They’re really postulating a model that would run counter to the way we, as cognitive scientists, know how the brain works.”
Even if built-in systems are safer than portable devices, the question remains whether they will be an ever present temptation that causes drivers to “spend more time distracted in some way,” says Adrian Lund, president of the insurance institute. “The honest answer is, we don’t know. This is an experiment we’re all in.”
The experiment is taking place in a regulatory vacuum. Federal safety rules dictate the minimum strength of vehicle roofs and door latches, the performance airbags, the stopping power of brakes, but automakers have carte blanche when it comes to the design of electronic systems. It’s been that way since NHTSA, a decade ago, challenged the industry to use its best judgment and do the right thing. The companies responded by developing voluntary guidelines, such as placing visual displays high enough so drivers can see them and scan the road at the same time.
The guidelines also recommend that electronic tasks should simple enough so drivers can perform them without looking away from the road for more than two seconds. In other words, complex tasks like typing in requests for directions may be locked out when the car is in motion. Even so, a car traveling at 60 miles per hour covers 176 feet in two seconds—which leaves little room for stopping if someone in front of you slams on the brakes, or a deer leaps out into the road.
There has never been an independent review of the industry guidelines, nor monitoring of companies’ compliance. But under Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, who has called distracted driving “a deadly epidemic,” federal authorities are becoming more active. NHTSA, for one, is developing its own guidelines, and plans to publish the first phase this fall.
Yet some watchdogs fear regulators have waited too long to get involved. Henry Jasny, vice president and senior counsel for Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, told me his group has been urging NHTSA to prepare for the onslaught of high-tech electronics ever since the 1990s. Now, they’ve let ”the animals get out of the barn,” he says, “and it may not be possible to get them back in.”
The best safety advice, Jasny adds, is still more or less what the old bumper sticker says: Hang Up And Drive. “We just don’t get why people should be encouraged not to pay attention to the driving task,” he says. “I understand that people get bored, they have other things they want to do, but they can pull over and do those without endangering the public.”

I’m ashamed to admit that I had to look up the word clerisy, which turns out to mean nothing more than intelligentsia. I guess that’s the price of going to a state university.
Anyway, Lowry’s essay is now available to us non-subscribers, so I read it. It’s mainly about the evolution of historiography in the United States, from old-school scholars who reliably extolled the greatness of our country to modern academics who bemoan the way we’ve treated blacks and native Americans and the poor and so forth. Lowry’s essay begins, predictably enough, with the usual conservative grumbling about Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States—a book I should read someday, I suppose—which has sold 2 million copies during its existence. This amounts to about 50,000 copies a year, giving it an Amazon ranking of #2,639 in the US history category at the moment. This doesn’t strike me as a mortal threat to American exceptionalism, but I suppose your mileage may vary.
This is followed by a brief potted history of how historians have treated US history over the past couple of centuries, climaxing with modern academics and their obsession with identity politics and the depredations of the rich and white against the poor and black:
I would sympathize more with this attitude if not for the fact that I have, personally, never read a popular history of the United States that took this anti-American attitude. Perhaps it’s common in academic monographs used by critical theory professors, but I have no particular evidence of that and Lowry doesn’t provide any. In any case, it certainly doesn’t seem to have seeped very far outside of academia, where history books and history channels and historical dramas mostly still seem to agree that America is a helluva place.
But all of this is just preface to the main thing that struck me about Lowry’s essay: nowhere does it display any interest in actual historical truth. On the contrary, he approvingly quotes William H. McNeill’s conviction that “believable myths” are necessary to public action. Maybe so—but surely America is not such a horrible place that a fair reading of its history will cause us all to drift into a fatal stagnation?
One can, obviously, disagree about how important some particular facet of American history is, but modern histories are almost unanimously superior to older tomes that suggested slavery wasn’t so bad; ignored the genocide of native Americans; pretended women didn’t exist; and portrayed the robber barons as noble titans of industry. As a matter of simple historical truth, surely most modern histories are, in fact, more accurate than the books of our parents’ childhoods that Lowry seems to favor?
Howard Zinn’s #2,639 ranking on Amazon.com doesn’t worry me. What does worry me is an ignorant nationalism that can be unleashed seemingly at will by conservative politicians who want to wage yet another dumb war or win power on the backs of racism and xenophobia. Right now that mindless form of nationalism is, quite clearly, still ascendant in Donald Trump’s America, and it’s a genuine danger. Anyone who genuinely opposes Trump—as Lowry claims to—really ought to be able to see that.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Jean Carroll, Writer Who Accused Trump of Rape, Sues for Defamation",Inae Oh,MotherJones,Politics,"E. Jean Carroll, the writer and advice columnist who in June came forward with allegations that President Donald Trump raped her inside the dressing rooms of Bergdorf Goodman more than twenty years ago, has filed a defamation lawsuit against the president.
“Nobody in this nation is above the law,” read Carroll’s complaint, which was filed on Monday in New York Supreme Court. “Nobody is entitled to conceal acts of sexual assault behind a wall of defamatory falsehoods and deflections. The rape of a woman is a violent crime; compounding that crime with acts of malicious libel is abhorrent.”
The suit alleges that Trump lied on two fronts: when he denied Carroll’s allegations, which she made in an explosive story for New York in June, and then later when the president claimed he had never even met Carroll.  “Each of these statements was false,” the complaint continued. “Each of them was defamatory.”
The suit also cites various statements Trump made in response to Carroll, including as Mother Jones noted at the time, the president’s insinuation that Carroll was too ugly to assault. “Indeed, Trump often responds to claims that he has behaved inappropriately by simultaneously attacking the individual’s credibility and attractiveness,” the complaint read.
This marks the second defamation lawsuit against Trump after he dismissed Summer Zervos’ sexual assault allegations as lies. He also claimed he never met Zervos. Last week, parts of Trump’s private calendar showed that he had stayed at a Beverly Hills hotel around the time that Zervos alleges he assaulted her in 2007.

“Many of these events, and the false narratives that emerge from them, resulted from an unfortunate alliance between Ukrainians who continue to operate within a corrupt system and Americans who either did not understand that system, that corrupt system, or who may have chosen, for their own purposes, to ignore it,” Marie Yovanovitch told members of three congressional committees compiling evidence for the ongoing impeachment inquiry. Democrats on Monday released the full transcript of her October 11 deposition, as well as the transcript of the October 16 deposition of Michael McKinley, who resigned last month from his post as a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Yovanovitch is a respected career State Department official who pursued an anti-corruption agenda after becoming ambassador to Ukraine in August 2016. Parts of her testimony have previously been reported. But the full transcript highlights Yovanovitch’s view that she had entered a sort of bizarro world in which the White House aligned itself with an array of questionable political and business figures in Ukraine in an effort to undermine her work.
“Our efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen,” Yovanovitch testified. “Sadly, someone was listening, and our nation is worse off for that.”
At the urging of Giuliani, who is Trump’s personal lawyer, the president forced Yovanovitch out of her post in May. That was one in a series of steps taken by the former New York City mayor in an alleged effort to bypass the State Department and refocus US foreign policy toward Ukraine to help Trump politically. Giuliani also sought to enlist Ukrainian officials in his efforts to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and discredit special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney recently acknowledged—and later denied—that Trump delayed military aid to Ukraine in part to pressure the country’s leaders to investigate Democrats.
In her testimony, Yovanovitch explained that she learned that Yuriy Lutsenko, the Ukrainian prosecutor general during most of her tenure, was instrumental in efforts to force her out. She said that he was unhappy about her push to curb corruption in the prosecutor’s office, which has long been notorious for functioning as a tool of powerful politicians and oligarches and for using legal threats to extort payoffs.
“He felt that I and the embassy were effective at helping Ukrainians who wanted to reform, Ukrainians who wanted to fight against corruption, and…that was not in his interest,” Yovanovitch said.
Asked if Lutsenko was personally corrupt, Yovanovitch said, “I have certainty heard a lot of people call him corrupt, and there are certainly a lot of stories about his actions that would indicate that.”
In late 2018, Giuliani—assisted by two since-indicted associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman—made contact with Lutsenko. The Ukrainian prosecutor told Giuliani, and publicly asserted, that Yovanovitch had given him a “do not prosecute” list populated with the names of people the ambassador supposedly wanted to protect. Lutsenko later recanted that claim. Giuliani also pushed an unfounded claim that Yovanovitch had urged embassy officials to ignore Trump’s orders. Yovanovitch told lawmakers both allegations were completely false.
Still, Yovanovitch says she learned through a Ukrainian officials that Lutsenko had spoken directly to Trump. According to Yovanovitch, she was told that Lutsenko told colleagues that during a call he had with Giuliani in January the former mayor had patched in the president.
Meanwhile, Parnas and Fruman were also attempting to force Yovanovitch out. She testified that she learned from Ukraine’s interior minister in February that the duo “were interested in having a different ambassador at the post, I guess because they wanted to have business dealings in Ukraine.” Parnas and Fruman had hoped to broker a deal to sell liquified natural gas from the United States to Ukraine’s national gas company. But Yovanovitch said that if those plans were legitimate, they had no reason to see her as an obstacle: “One of the biggest jobs of an American ambassador…is to promote US business,” she said. “If legitimate business comes to us…that’s what we do, we promote US business.”
Parnas and Fruman were indicted last month for various campaign finance violations. The pair gave campaign donations to  former Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) who then pressed the State Department for Yovanovitch’s removal. The indictment says the men acted at the direction of a Ukrainian official. That official is reportedly Lutsenko.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Taxes. That makes sense. California has famously high taxes, after all.
Except that it doesn’t. The state that conservative Californians are allegedly flocking to is Texas, and for your average middle-class worker or retiree its taxes are surprisingly similar to the People’s Republic of California. Here’s the comparison from the good folks at ITEP:
If you’re poor, California has lower taxes. If you’re rich, Texas has lower taxes. But if you’re middle class, there’s barely any difference. You’ll pay about 8-10 percent of your income in state and local taxes.
These are averages, of course, and individuals can differ considerably depending on their circumstances. But large migrations depend on averages, and the middle 60 percent of the population averages about the same in both states. That may seem counterintuitive given that California is the #2 state for progressive taxation and Texas is #51, but this is due entirely to the tax rates of the rich and the poor.

But He Has Big Ideas for How Democrats Could Take Back the Country.,Kara Voght,MotherJones,Politics,"Sherrod Brown was going to run for president. But he wrote a book instead.
Well, not exactly, the Ohio senator protests when I say as much. “I didn’t think, ‘Well, it’s a presidential primary and we gotta beat Trump, it’s time to write this book,’” he explains, in his unmistakable voice that shares a cadence with an idling diesel engine. Brown tells me he’s been working on Desk 88, in bookstores on November 5, since the beginning of the Obama administration—a time, in his estimation, that “looked like potentially another progressive era” before Republicans retook control of the House of Representatives in 2010.
That’s the central conceit of Brown’s latest tome: American progressivism, as told through the stories of eight Democrats who have called Brown’s assigned desk on the Senate floor—you guessed it, Desk 88—their own. (In the Senate, lawmakers choose their desks from among those vacated by their predecessors; Democrats sit, counterintuitively, together on the right side of the room.) Among those profiled: Hugo Black, the Alabama senator who was once a KKK member but later upheld pivotal civil rights decisions as a member of the Supreme Court; Albert Gore Sr., the former vice president’s father, who entered the Senate as a civil rights detractor but left it a defender; and Robert F. Kennedy, brother of John F. and 1968 presidential candidate who championed anti-poverty and anti-war causes during his brief Senate tenure. “What drew me to Desk 88 was the idea that connected them: progressivism,” Brown writes. “Progressives of all generations, and certainly those who sat at Desk 88, share a revulsion at injustice and wage inequality and wealth disparity.”
Brown’s effort isn’t merely a solipsistic trivia exercise. Desk 88 presents a concise history of America’s progressive eras. In the book, Brown identifies three: the labor reforms of the turn of the 20th century, the New Deal programs under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and the civil rights advances under President Lyndon B. Johnson. As he does, he observes some broader themes. Each epoch lasted only a handful of years, but their effects run long—the advances made in workers’ rights, civil rights, health care, and environmental protections have been nearly unassailable once their underlying bills were signed into law.
Does Brown think we’re in a progressive moment now? No, he says definitely, blaming the occupant of the White House and Republican leadership in the Senate for blocking the progressive agenda. But he is hopeful for the future. Brown doesn’t linger on policy prescriptions, and if he had, self-identifying “progressives” might have chafed at them: Brown does not support Medicare for All or the Green New Deal, two cornerstones of the left’s platform. Instead, Brown lays out a vision for honoring the “dignity of work,” a phrase with origins in a Martin Luther King Jr. sermon that Brown’s flirtations with the presidency injected into the 2020 Democratic primary lexicon. “If work is honored and respected, workers feel valued; and when they know our society believes in the dignity of work, and their employers believe in their dignity of work, workers are empowered as citizens,” Brown writes. “That strengthens our communities, our nation, and our democracy.”
On the eve of his book’s release, I asked him about what he learned about the progressive movement, what he thinks is wrong with the 2020 presidential primary, and how we should remember the complicated lawmakers who once sat at Brown’s desk—lawmakers who were at times complicit with racism and bigotry but advanced the progressive causes nonetheless.
Why did you decide to write this book now?
I wanted to learn more about this place I work in and I wanted to know more about progressive history. And I think you learn from looking back. There was the Progressive Era of the 1910s—in spite of Woodrow Wilson being a racist, it was a progressive era on finance and some other things, workers’ compensation, things like that. Then the 1930s, what Roosevelt and Congress did in ’33, ’34, ’35, ’36, and then in ’64, ’65, ’66. What jumped out at me was how short progressive eras are—how the reaction is fierce and furious, and how we do such big things in them that it affects people’s lives in big ways, no matter how much the right wing tries to chip away at it. I wanted to think about historic trends and how it affects our ability to fight for progressive values. And that sort of came out to me reading it that way.
Interesting that you note you started writing this in 2009 and 2010, when you thought you were on the cusp of another progressive era during the Obama presidency. Are we in a progressive moment?
We’re not in a progressive moment yet. We have a terrible Supreme Court, a worse than imaginable president, and someone who takes particular pleasure in the Senate of dumping stuff in his legislative graveyard. I don’t necessarily predict this, but I think in 2020 we very well could have the dawning of a new progressive era with a new Senate and a new president. We’ll see. But the King quotation in the book’s prologue, at the top of the page—it says, “We must come to see that human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability.” That’s really the call to action in any kind of any kind of movement.
So your yardstick for progressivism has to do with the laws that get passed and the programs that get enacted, not the spirit in the room?
No, it is the spirit in the room. I mean, this stuff never happens in isolation. I’m not a professional historian here, but Johnson could do all he did because the civil rights movement was really boiling up, because Kennedy was assassinated, because they’d come out of the sleepiness of the Eisenhower years because this next generation was coming up—the kids of the World War II veterans. All that came about in a sort of perfect storm to do all this.
You gotta be ready for the opportunity. And I want us to be ready in 2021. I’m already thinking, what do we do in the Banking committee, if I’m chairman in 2021, for housing? The committee is called Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, but we don’t do much housing right now, and that should be the agenda if we win the Senate and take back the White House.
Throughout the book, you cite a construct of the “Conservator” from Ralph Waldo Emerson’s 1841 essay The Conservative as a way of wrestling with the tensions that exist between progressive populism and those who try to hold it back. You write, “Conservators—those with privilege and wealth, who want to hold on to what they have—are vastly outnumbered,” Brown writes. “But they long ago figured out how to consolidate power: exploit the fear of people who would benefit from change by convincing them that change is too risky.” Can you tell me why that’s a helpful way to think about progressivism and movement politics?
So the Emerson construct of history’s an ongoing battle between the Conservators and Innovators. The Conservators want to hold onto their privilege and progressives want to move the country forward and give people, particularly moderate- to low-income people, an opportunity to get ahead.
I just think that everything changes and nothing changes. I guess what came through loud and clear is: The Conservators never ever give up. Powerful people—the ones that cling to their wealth and status—they lose fights, but they never want to lose the war. We won a lot of times against them. We have Medicare, workers’ comp, minimum wage laws, safe drinking water laws, better civil rights laws—all those things. We’ve won a lot, but they always try to dismantle—the Affordable Care Act is the best example.
With that construct in mind, are there any lessons that you think the 2020 field isn’t heeding as they try to recapture the White House?
Nobody’s talked about the dignity of work enough. I’ve been thinking a lot about this. There’s a story I tell in the book: I was at a Ford plant in 2000 and people were just sitting in the cafeteria—eight or 10 workers were there on break. They were all voting for Gore except one. And I said, “Why aren’t you voting for Gore? Why are you voting for Bush?” He said, “Well, Gore wants to take my gun.” And the guy sitting next to me says, ”Well, Sherrod’s got the same position on guns and you vote for him.” And he said, ”Yeah, but Brown fights for me.”
I think the most important lesson from this book and the most important lesson to me in the Midwest is you’ve got to fight for workers in their workplace and that will overcome that. That it doesn’t mean that I’ll ever get 60 percent in Appalachia again like I used to. I make up for it in greater Columbus and greater Cincinnati. But it does mean that people will listen even if they don’t like my position on guns—and I’ve held that for 30 years, 25 years. They don’t like my position on marriage equality—I came out more than 20 years ago for it. They don’t like that I’m pro-choice. They may not like those things, but if they know I’m fighting for them in their workplace, we will get enough of their votes to win. The workplace isn’t just union steelworkers. It’s hospital workers, it’s people that prepare the food in the cafeteria, it’s people who clean offices. It’s the way to talk about the dignity of work. You look at the world, as you campaign, through the eyes of workers, and you look at the world, as you govern, through the eyes of workers.
It’s not like “dignity of work” hasn’t come up. One of the Democratic candidates has said the phrase in almost every debate. Do you think the message isn’t coming through?
I don’t think anybody’s doing it enough. I mean, I’m not in the arena so I don’t have much room to talk. I just know any number of these candidates can win the industrial Midwest if they really focus on the workers. And again, I make it clear it’s not just white male boilermakers or firefighters. It’s people of color. It’s young people. It’s this broad, broad working class in this country of 70 or 80 percent of the workers.
I’m sure you caught President Obama’s remarks this week about Twitter outrage and wokeness and how, to him, that isn’t productive activism. And I was thinking about that in terms of some of the people you write about in the book, people who were ostensibly unforgivably bad actors but were important in advancing some modicum of the progressive cause. How do you reconcile their contributions to the progressive movement with their complicated, problematic past?
Some things you never forgive, like being a KKK member. But you also embrace change. When you ask people to change and they change, you accept that, and you don’t keep pointing backwards and you welcome them to the struggle and the fight. Everybody in this book—including the guy who wrote it—is flawed in our careers and in our lives. I tried not to judge—although I probably did some—but I also recognized the unevenness of their careers and their fights.
Some look better than others. Only one started as a KKK member, and he became one of the best justices—he was burned in effigy at the Alabama Law School, after he did the Brown v. Board of Education decision. I think—though I’m not sure on this—he was one who really helped them to get to unanimous on it. So, you welcome that, you don’t forget it, you don’t entirely forgive it. I’m a white guy talking about a guy that belonged in the Klan, I understand that. I know all these senators were uneven. I also know in this book that everybody who held my desk was a Democrat and everybody who held my desk was a male and everybody who held my desk was white. I would assume that, after I leave the Senate, that the next five holders of this desk—I assume we’ll see people of color and women, as we should.
I wanted to ask you about the last chapter in the book. There’s a progressive movement of young people closely aligned with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and her allies who emphasize the idea of turning out voters who have historically not voted and have been underserved by government. In the book, you note that theory of change but advance another: You say it’s not just about engaging folks who haven’t been engaged, but actually trying to court some of the voters who used to be Democrats and have now turned away. Who do you think is right?
Well, I think we’re both right. I rely on people like her and others—my daughter is a council member in Columbus and she’s on the ballot again this year for a second term. She engages with young people all the time, as I do. It means getting new people to the polls, to be sure.
But you know, millennial workers—people working in restaurants and people who go to Columbus State Community College to be physical therapists and have a decent living, but never get rich and are going to struggle sometimes—they’re all part of the dignity of work. And those are people we’re gonna win. But if you talk about work—I mean, that’s what almost all of us have in common. We’re all doing something productive for our country. It might be moving back home for six months with your dying parent and putting her in hospice. It might mean staying out of the workforce for a year and raising a child. It’s always about family leave and having sick days. And that appeals to all kinds of workers. That appeals to people in a very upscale Columbus—which is now Democratic off the charts, though it was Republican, when I started in politics—but also appeals in Steubenville, which was 65 percent Democratic when I started and now it’s 40 percent Democratic.
I just have never subscribed to this view. I was told when I thought about the presidential race was you either talk to our progressive base or you talk to workers. And the answer is no, that’s a false choice. You never compromise on choice and guns and marriage equality, but you talk about worker rights. If you turn up the volume on worker rights, you’re going to appeal to everybody who feels that they haven’t had the chance to get ahead. I’m actually less likely than some of the young members of Congress to compromise on marriage equality and choice and guns because I’ve been beaten up on those three issues for 20 years and I haven’t compromised. So you do that without compromise, but you turn the volume up on talking to workers about the dignity of work.

On the evening of October 23, in the middle of the kind of dry, windy night that has become more frequent and more terrifying in recent California autumns, a fire began outside the small unincorporated Northern California town of Geyserville. Over the next two days, as winds reached hurricane-like strength, they carried the fire south, burning some 75,000 acres and threatening some 90,000 structures as of Wednesday afternoon. So on Sunday, the sheriff of Sonoma County did something unprecedented: He ordered some 200,000 residents out of the area, as far west as the Pacific Ocean, marking it the largest wildfire-related mandatory evacuation order that anyone in his office could remember.
The sheriff, Mark Essick, knew some people would be angry about his decision, which no doubt disrupted lives and cost the local economy. “I can understand why someone in [the coastal town of] Bodega Bay is saying, ‘C’mon. What are you guys doing?’ I don’t take these decisions lightly,” he told the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat. But Essick was thinking of the Tubbs Fire, which killed 22 people in the county just two years ago, and of the Camp Fire, which ripped through the 20,000-person town of Paradise last year and killed 83 people just to Sonoma’s east. In Paradise, authorities reportedly didn’t order residents out until the fire had reached the town, where only one road led out of harm’s way.
That’s progress, says Thomas Cova, who studies wildfire evacuations at the University of Utah. “The first thing I think is, ‘OK, no fatalities!’ I actually feel a little bit better when I see that the headlines have to do with the number of people who left, because that means everything went well.”
Ordering evacuations in the face of wildfire is a mix of art and science, in part because officials have only about two decades’ worth of research to rely on. Historically, perfecting evacuations for hurricanes has received a lot more attention, which makes practical sense: They tend to affect millions, not thousands.
But hurricanes can be very different from wildfires. Officials can have days to discuss and implement plans to get people out of the way of large storms, and to communicate those plans through social media or the local news. Even with new early warning systems, fires can develop much more quickly. Residents might only have hours—or less—between a warning and flames reaching their homes.
Since the late 1990’s, more deadly wildfires have swept the western US, due in part to climate change, in part to forest management practices, in part to a struggling utility company, and in part to development along the wildland-urban interface—meaning more people live in fire-prone places. “It’s been really stark raving mad, a real out-of-control madhouse,” says Cova, as he runs down the list of destructive fires.
Those fires have complicated everyone’s understanding of how residents get out of the way of fires—and whether they choose to leave at all. People don’t always evacuate the way officials think they will. One paper published last year, for example, shows that decisions to evacuate are driven by how people feel about different kinds of risk. (Are you someone who generally takes risks—who might skip the seatbelt behind the wheel, or take a skydiving class? You’re slightly more likely to stay after a mandatory evacuation order and “defend” your home. Are you the sort of person who takes financial risks, a literal horse gambler? You’re a bit less likely to hang around during a mandatory evacuation.) It also suggests that a lot of folks go with the “wait-and-see” approach, even in the face of a “mandatory evacuation” order. Can they see or smell the flames? What are their neighbors doing? And once they decide to go, how quickly can they get out?
In the past, fears of mass panic have convinced local officials to skip Amber-like alerts, even where the technology exists. (During 2017 Tubbs Fire, authorities decided not to send to send an alert because they worried an alarm would hamper their rescue efforts.) But years of research suggests that disaster-induced panic is mostly a myth. In fact, social scientists observe more generous behavior—checking on neighbors to make sure they have a way out of town, for example—than anti-social behavior like trampling and looting.
That doesn’t mean wildfire evacuations are always straightforward. Checking on neighbors can take time, and so can making a stop to pick up a family member, a kid, or some food, the kind of behavior that’s been observed in hurricane evacuations. Evacuations are also shaped by local transportation options—whether residents have cars, and how many roads lead to safety.
In theory, these sorts of insights into human behavior should be applied by transportation planners, but that doesn’t always happen. “If you follow the transportation engineering approach, you would see some common assumptions made in developing an evacuation plan: that everyone will evacuate if they receive a mandatory order, and when they do, they’ll take the shortest route,” says Micah Brachman, a geographer who lectures at the University of Maryland and has worked with city planners and emergency management officials on evacuations. But “the routes people take to evacuate are pretty varied, so it’s not a good assumption to say that everyone knows the fastest way to get out.”
Even when engineers talk to emergency management officials, there are times when there’s only one road out. Gridlock happens. (Last weekend, jams snaked out of the towns of Windsor and Healdsburg after the evacuation order; no one was hurt.) For that reason, more emergency management officials have been thinking about an alternative to evacuations: staying home. Or at least close to home. During the Camp Fire, as the flames bore down, some in Paradise sought shelter in a sturdy, steel-and-concrete church—and survived. A more formalized policy, adopted from the Australian approach to wildfire, would see towns and cities identify and even build “fire bunkers,” places where they could concentrate people and fire-fighting resources without demanding everyone flee.
Some of the officials looking at the “shelter in place” option see it as a last resort; others, especially those living in towns with limited transportation options, see it as a smart and viable way to make sure residents survive disaster. As the American West’s now nearly year-round fire season continues, surviving may take all the creativity emergency managers can muster.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

There are probably three or four of you who are interested in this, so here’s my review of my shiny new Surface Pro 7.
I finally caved in and bought the top-of-the-line model, for reasons that have little to do with performance but are too complicated to spend any time on. It’s got a Core i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of SSD hard drive. Performance is very snappy indeed, about as good as my desktop computer. It connects to WiFi networks quickly and reliably and download speeds are excellent.
The only physical change from previous models is the addition of a USB-C port, which is very handy. I transfer files from my camera to the tablet all the time, and the combination of high performance and the USB-C port makes transfers about 10-20x faster than with my previous Surface Pro 5.
Battery life is finally acceptable. I haven’t run the Pro 7 down to zero yet, but it looks to me like it gets a legit eight hours of battery life based on moderate, everyday use: mostly browsing, e-reading, and photoshopping. (I don’t do any gaming, so I have no idea how well it performs or how long it lasts for gamers.)
Everything else is about the same as before. The screen resolution is great; it weighs about a pound and a half; and it costs a fortune. My last two Surface Pros have both developed screen problems after about 18 months, so I highly recommend getting the 2-year extended warranty.
This is my first tablet that I truly have no complaints about—aside from the $2,000 price tag, that is. Here’s hoping that it lasts me a good long time.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Or a smattering of cheers and applause. Or just blasting music from overhead.
However, following the deeply satisfying videos of the boos that greeted Trump’s appearance at Game 5 of the World Series last Sunday—and the wall–to–wall media coverage, including our own—determining the precise mix of boos versus cheers in the crowd is now a high-stakes feat of political analysis, and the verdicts following Trump’s UFC appearance are mixed.
Here are some videos that you can judge for yourself:



The president, for his part, has decided that entering the Garden was a “little bit like walking into a Trump rally,” he tweeted. “Great energy,” he added.

And, accordingly, the Fox News spin machine whirred to life this morning to guard the ego of their number-one viewer. “The president got a big reception,” Fox & Friends cohost Pete Hegseth put it. “This is a crowd that appreciates the brawler style of a brawler president.”
“There are some media outlets saying they heard mostly boos,” cohost Ed Henry chimed in. “This has become so juvenile. If you actually listen to the video and the audio, there clearly were a ton of cheers.”

The belief that Ukraine, not Russia, was actually behind the hack is a pretty confusing but persistent conspiracy theory on the right, despite being thoroughly debunked. And now new documents reveal just how deep the theory runs in Trump world: Former campaign chair Paul Manafort was suggesting Ukraine was involved in the stealing of Democratic emails as far back as 2016.
On Saturday, BuzzFeed released reams of previously secret memos from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. BuzzFeed reports that the documents show that Rick Gates, Manafort’s number 2, told investigators in April 2018 that “after the campaign learned in June 2016 that WikiLeaks had the hacked DNC emails, Manafort had said that the hack was ‘likely carried by the Ukrainians, not the Russians,’ according to FBI notes.”
Gates also reportedly revealed that the theory was shared by one of Manafort’s associates with alleged ties to Russian intelligence, Konstantin Kilimnik—another key player in the Russia-election saga, who we’ve written about frequently in the past—as well as former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.

Again.,Madison Pauly,MotherJones,Politics,"President Donald Trump just threatened to cut off federal funding to California over Gov. Gavin Newsom’s “forest management,” which the president blamed for the wildfires that have ripped through wide swaths of the state over the past few weeks. “I told him from the first day we met that he must ‘clean’ his forest floors,” Trump tweeted bright and early on Sunday morning. “Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers.”
“Every year, as the fire’s [sic] rage & California burns, it is the same thing- and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more.”


Nevermind that only about 2 percent of California forests are managed by the state government, compared to the 57 percent of California forests run by the federal government, according to a report from the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office. As the Los Angeles Times pointed out this morning, none of the fires that hit Southern California last week were even forest fires. Here’s their list of how the fires got started and the urban, suburban, and mountainous areas that burned:
Baseless as it may be, Trump’s threat to pull federal funding from California is hardly a new tactic. Last November, after more than 80 people died in the devastating Camp Fire, he did the same thing. “Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!” he threatened, claiming “gross mismanagement of the forests” was to blame. The office of then-Gov. Jerry Brown fired back, calling the president’s comments “inane and uninformed.” (And just as he is now, back then he was also confused over California’s water policy.)
This morning Newsom expressed the same disdain for Trump’s comments. “You don’t believe in climate change,” he tweeted in response to the president. “You are excused from this conversation.”

They soon discovered that static electricity had caused entrapped methane from the flatulence and manure of 90 dairy cows to explode.
Headline writers had a field day. But the incident pointed to a serious problem: Ruminant livestock, mostly cattle, account for 30 percent of all global methane emissions, pumping out 3 gigatons of the gas every year in their burps, farts, and manure. Methane is an especially potent greenhouse gas: During its 12-year lifespan after being released, it traps 84 times as much heat as carbon dioxide, and its effect on global warming over a century is 34 times that of CO2. According to the United Nations, reducing methane emissions from cows could be one of the quickest ways to slow climate change.
The United States government has done little to curb this potent pollution, which makes up 36 percent of the country’s methane emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency’s AgStar program trains farmers to turn animal waste into biofuel using anaerobic digesters, but it is optional—8,000 farms could implement it, but only about 250 have done so.
Ermias Kebreab, an animal science professor at the University of California–Davis, has spent 15 years studying alternative ways to reduce livestock effusions. Three years ago, he heard that researchers at Australia’s James Cook University had mixed bacteria from cows’ digestive systems with red seaweed and discovered a drastic decrease in methane production. Their lab experiment suggested that reformulating a cow’s diet to contain 2 percent seaweed could reduce its methane emissions by 99 percent.
Kebreab tried to replicate those results with actual animals. His team mixed varying levels of Asparagopsis armata, a type of red seaweed, into the feed of 12 dairy cows over a two-month period. The results were shocking: When the cattle’s chow consisted of just 1 percent seaweed, their methane emissions went down 60 percent. “In all the years that I’ve worked in this area, I’ve never seen anything that reduced it that much,” Kebreab says.
These are preliminary results, but they offer exciting prospects. Seaweed doesn’t require precious freshwater, fertilizer, or land to grow. It can reverse ocean acidification by absorbing carbon dioxide. We’d have to grow quite a bit of seaweed to rely on it for sequestration: One study suggests we could remove the equivalent of 42 percent of all current global CO2 emissions by covering 4 percent of the world’s oceans in seaweed farms—but that’s a lot of ocean.
And as a review published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization notes, if aquaculturists remove rocks or native sea grasses to plant massive seaweed farms, they could disrupt ecosystems and even alter coastal currents. But responsible seaweed cultivation could be a boon to marine habitats, providing nurseries for fish and snails, argues Paul Dobbins, a senior specialist at the World Wildlife Fund and former president of a kelp farm in Maine.
The need to rein in methane emissions is especially urgent in Cali­fornia, home to 1.8 million dairy cows. A 2016 law requires the state air resources board to implement a strategy to reduce these emissions by 40 percent from 2013 levels by 2030. In hopes of helping farmers meet those goals, Kebreab and his team launched a larger version of his cow study in March, using 21 steers that he monitored for six months. So far, the results mirror the first experiment’s, but a full analysis won’t be ready until December. Kebreab’s biggest hurdle has been finding enough seaweed; the variety that’s useful for cows isn’t domestically available.
Massachusetts-based Australis Aquaculture hopes to cultivate red Asparagopsis on ropes anchored off the coast of Vietnam. CEO Josh Goldman is excited about feeding his underwater crop to cows: “You don’t have to rebuild 10,000 power plants in the world. You basically create a modest feed additive that has a big leverage effect.”
WWF’s Dobbins says seaweed farming can be a “triple win”: a way to grow nutritious food for both cows and people, provide coastal jobs, and improve the marine environment. “Everything you do in food production has pluses and minuses relative to the environment,” he says. “Seaweed farming, if done correctly, actually comes out more on the plus side.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Now a Leaky Landfill Is Contaminating Groundwater.,"Naveena Sadasivam,Kiah Collier",MotherJones,Environment,"This story was originally published by Grist and The Texas Tribune and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.
It seems like everyone in Rockdale is talking about Sandow Lakes Ranch. That’s because so many residents of this old mining hub in Central Texas believe that the fate of the 32,000-acre tract is crucial to the future of their town.
For years, the ranch’s owner has been trying to sell the property, and for years, Rockdale residents have been buzzing about potential buyers, from a longshot bid for Amazon’s HQ2 to news that a Bitcoin-mining company might soon set up shop. Amazon, of course, didn’t pick Rockdale, and the Bitcoin company scaled back its plans.
For more than half a century, Rockdale was largely a company town, and as many as 2,000 people worked on that property, where a sprawling coal mine fed a power plant that in turn powered an energy-hungry aluminum smelter.
The mine and smelter were owned by Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, and the generations of Rockdale residents who worked there proudly called themselves Alcoans. At one point, the company accounted for 40 percent of the county’s tax base and 65 percent of the local school district’s budget.
But in 2008, after 56 years of operating in the town about an hour’s drive northeast of Austin, Alcoa dropped a bombshell: It would shutter the smelter that employed about 10 percent of the town’s population. Nine years later, cutthroat competition from natural gas and renewables led Luminant, the largest power producer in Texas, to close its coal-fired Sandow Power Plant and lay off another 450 people. By then, Alcoa had closed the coal mine, too, relying on lignite from the nearby Three Oaks mine.
The town hasn’t recovered. School enrollment has dropped 17 percent over the last decade, and the proportion of economically disadvantaged students has increased from 53 percent to 68 percent. Bobby Dhaliwal, a Rockdale native who works at his family’s Shell gas station downtown, said business has fallen by half since Alcoa and Luminant halted operations.
“Everything is in transition,” he said. “And everyone is hoping for some new retail business.”
In 2016, Alcoa put the former coal mine and its adjoining industrial facilities on the market with a new name — Sandow Lakes Ranch — and a hefty price tag of $250 million.
In marketing the sprawling property, Dallas-based real estate company Icon Global describes it as a country paradise: “The natural beauty is protected and thrives with native flora and fauna, offering ample opportunities for the outdoor and recreational enthusiast.”
For at least the last two decades, the company has replaced thousands of tons of earth it had excavated to reach the coal seams, covered the land in clean soil, and planted grass and other vegetation. And the Railroad Commission of Texas, the state agency that oversees coal mining, has approved these remediation efforts.
“We release the site knowing it is in great shape for its next chapter in the story of Texas,” said Denny Kingsley, then head of the commission’s Surface Mining and Reclamation Division, in a September 2018 press release that hailed Alcoa’s work.
But a review of Railroad Commission records, as well as interviews with former agency employees, indicate the mine site may not be in the immaculate condition that the marketing materials describe. The description glosses over the fact that about 70 percent of the 32,000 acres were once part of a strip mine, where each year the company removed enough dirt and coal to fill the Panama Canal and buried coal ash containing toxic heavy metals under hundreds of acres. The “pristine lakes” on the property are man-made features that once collected acidic mine waste.
Any future buyer will also have to plan around a 169-acre landfill that sits in the middle of the property — an area that isn’t part of Sandow Lakes Ranch because it’s owned by Luminant.
The landfill has been primarily used to dispose of coal ash, a heavy-metal-laced byproduct of burning coal at the now-shuttered plant. In the months leading up to the Railroad Commission’s approval of Alcoa’s remediation plan, Luminant tested the groundwater around the landfill. An examination of those results by an environmental group called the Environmental Integrity Project indicated that the heavy metals from the coal ash had made their way into the groundwater. The analysis showed that concentrations of arsenic, mercury, cobalt, and lithium were well over the federal limits for human consumption and could present significant risk to public health.
Julia Kravchenko, a research scientist and physician at Duke University, said contaminants in coal ash can spread far from a storage site, especially during floods and severe storms. Those contaminants, she said, “can enter the food chain and the environment and persist for a really long time at really high concentrations.”
Surrounding the landfill, Alcoa restored nearly 3,000 acres of land for industrial or commercial use, a relatively lax standard that can save companies millions of dollars in remediation costs and doesn’t require the company to test the soil for heavy metals or other toxins commonly associated with coal. The Railroad Commission approved the reclamation plan.
Of the approximately two dozen coal mines in Texas, an analysis of public records by Grist and The Texas Tribune found that no company has received approval to restore as much land to industrial-commercial standards as Alcoa.
Jim Beck, a spokesperson for Alcoa, said that the company “completed all required reclamation work” for the Sandow mine and that the “rigorous process of reviewing and approving the reclamation results took place over many years.
“This was a very thorough process, which included oversight from the state government and notification to a host of federal agencies,” he said. “In every case, Alcoa met or exceeded standards for surface water, groundwater, soil, and re-vegetation.”
But Travis Brown, a longtime area resident and environmental activist who founded a community group to fight against Alcoa and Luminant, is not convinced. After all, he said, the Environmental Integrity Project’s analysis of Luminant’s own testing shows high levels of mercury and arsenic near the landfill that sits within the land Alcoa is selling.
“You wouldn’t want to drink or feed animals out of it,” Brown said of the property’s lakes, which once contained toxic metals. He added that the eventual buyer of Sandow Lakes Ranch will likely have to contend with major contamination: “God knows what’s buried out there.”
The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, the federal law that regulates restoration at mines sites, says that companies should aim to return land to its prior condition and purpose. In Texas, that’s primarily forest or pastureland.
But the law provides plenty of wiggle room. Companies can suggest alternatives if they can prove the land will actually be used for other purposes within a reasonable timeframe.
Securing industrial-commercial designation for land saves mining companies time in two ways: Less-intensive restoration can be completed faster, and the post-restoration monitoring period is shorter. Before mining, companies also have to set aside money for restoration in the form of bonds, and they can usually get that money back faster when the Railroad Commission approves land for industrial-commercial use.
“You can [satisfy] industrial-commercial land use just by laying rock on the surface and cover it with gravel if you want to,” said a former inspector, who requested anonymity for fear that speaking out would affect his current employment.
In Texas, an analysis of state records shows companies are increasingly asking the Railroad Commission for permission to do just that — even when there isn’t sufficient evidence the land will be used for industrial or commercial purposes. And the agency is increasingly granting those requests.
Since 1988, the Railroad Commission’s Surface Mining and Reclamation Division has approved I/C land use for about 6,800 acres, according to an analysis of public records by Grist and the Tribune. That’s still dwarfed by other land uses — about 34,000 acres of reclaimed mine property were turned into pastureland during the same time period — but the acreage approved for industrial-commercial use has more than doubled since 2010 to 440 acres per year.
“They would change land use to industrial and commercial when there was no [plan for] industry or commercial activity at all,” said the former inspector, who routinely worked with mining companies that pursued the designation.
“It’s kind of a loophole.”
Since 2002, which is as far back as state data provided to Grist and the Tribune goes, Alcoa has received permission to reclaim more acres to the industrial-commercial standard than any other company in the state — about 2,900 acres, or more than 25 percent of the 11,000 acres it sought to reclaim at the old Sandow mine. That’s much higher than the industry average of 10 percent.
Among the land it restored under the lower restoration standard is a 561-acre strip of land that contains a dusty gravel road and, until recently, a 20-mile-long conveyor belt that looked like a misplaced roller coaster track. Both were used to move thousands of tons of lignite from Luminant’s Three Oaks mine, south of the property, to its Sandow Power Plant. Dotted with clusters of trees, the strip, which hugs the edge of the mine site, is part of the 32,000 acres Alcoa is now trying to sell.
The Railroad Commission initially designated the strip for pastureland and fish and wildlife habitat — which would have required Alcoa to conduct soil testing to prove it wasn’t leaving behind acid-forming chemicals and to demonstrate the land could sustain vegetation for five years.
But in 2017, Alcoa petitioned the commission to change the land use to I/C, arguing that the presence of the haul road and the conveyor belt justified the change. If the agency agreed, Alcoa could skip the soil testing and would only have to plant enough grass to prevent soil erosion — without needing to prove that it would survive for at least five years.
According to the company’s estimates, switching the land-use designation would reduce its costs by between $330 to $525 per acre — a savings of at least $185,000 to $300,000.
But the technical specialist at the commission who was assigned to the case, Katherine Upham, didn’t buy Alcoa’s argument for the change.
“You reference ‘industrial activities’ in your letter, but that is too vague for a change to I/C,” she wrote in an August 2017 email to an Alcoa manager. “There are lots of areas that do not look like they would be used for I/C (e.g. the areas between the haul road and conveyor belt or the areas along the haul road).”
Upham asked for proof that the property would indeed be used for industrial and commercial purposes.
On October 10, 2017, Alcoa signed an agreement to lease the land to Luminant for “various industrial activities.” Three days later, Luminant announced it would shut down all operations at both the Sandow mine and power plant.
Nevertheless, Alcoa submitted a copy of the lease to the Railroad Commission about a month after Luminant’s announcement as evidence the land would continue to be used for industrial purposes. By then, several Texas newspapers and trade publications had covered the news of Luminant’s impending closures.
Still, the commission accepted Alcoa’s claim that the haul road and conveyor belt would continue to be used for industrial activities. Letters and documents related to the application, obtained through a public records request, do not show any further communications from Upham about the land-use change, and the agency ultimately approved the application in December 2017. Upham did not respond to multiple requests for an interview.
Beck, the Alcoa spokesperson, said the conveyor belt has been mostly dismantled and that the haul road is still being used to access the property. He said receiving permission to restore to industrial-commercial standards allowed the company to put the land on the market sooner for economic redevelopment. “However,” he added, “this did not impact the quality of the reclamation.”
Beck said that the standard did not save the company money because although it changed the land use on paper, in reality Alcoa decided to mostly restore the land for agricultural use. The land is healthy enough that farmers have been harvesting hay on the property, he said — and, as a result, the company did not reduce its reclamation costs despite receiving industrial-commercial designation.
Joe Pizarchik, the head of the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement during the Obama administration, reviewed Alcoa’s application at the request of Grist and the Tribune. He found that the company didn’t provide sufficient evidence to justify the land-use change.
Federal regulations state the company must show that it’s reasonably likely that the land will be used for industrial-commercial purposes. “They never identified the use,” Pizarchik said. “So, if you do not identify the use, it is not possible to demonstrate that there is a reasonable likelihood.”
Lisa Evans, an attorney with the nonprofit environmental law firm Earthjustice, put it more plainly: She called Aloca’s reasoning “an excuse instead of legal justification.”
Alcoa purchased the Sandow mine and built a smelter and the Sandow coal plant in Rockdale in the early 1950s. Ever since, the company has been in a never-ending battle to find ways to dispose of the waste generated by the smelter and power plant. It has buried carbon dust, created when coal is crushed, on about 10 acres south of the smelter, and molten slag from the coal boiler on another 120 acres. It distributed the fine ash left behind after burning coal — the largest category of waste produced — over a handful of landfills and pits across more than 650 acres.
And those are the sites Alcoa knows about. Many disposal sites are so old that in records submitted to state agencies, the company said, “The exact extent of the legacy waste mine works old disposal sites are unknown.”
To create yet another coal ash disposal site in 2013, Luminant, which had taken an ownership stake in the Sandow coal plant, built the 169-acre landfill on land leased from Alcoa. While Luminant owned the landfill, the land underneath still belonged to Alcoa. So Alcoa was responsible for restoring the site to the satisfaction of the Railroad Commission.
The landfill sits within the 2,900 acres Alcoa restored for industrial-commercial use. A former Railroad Commission inspector familiar with the Sandow mine said that because the landfill was approved for industrial-commercial use, the agency only required inspectors to check if the slopes of the landfill were stable. It didn’t require collection of soil samples to test for toxic materials.
But testing has found that groundwater around the landfill has been contaminated. After the EPA finalized its 2015 rule governing coal ash disposal, power providers were required to make their groundwater monitoring data publicly available. Last year, Luminant’s tests of 10 wells around the landfill showed that heavy metals from the site have already leached into the ground and contaminated groundwater in the area.
The testing data is available on Luminant’s website. An analysis of those results by the Environmental Integrity Project — a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit of former EPA employees — concluded that the groundwater contains concentrations of arsenic, mercury, cobalt, and lithium that are 25 times the federal limit for human consumption.
Coal ash has four to 10 times the concentration of toxins as coal, and research has found that people living close to coal ash impoundments and landfills have a higher risk of premature death. They are more likely to suffer from a slew of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, including pneumonia, lung cancer, and heart attacks.
“There is always risk of contamination from storing coal ash,” said Kravchenko, the Duke University researcher. “For health, it’s much more toxic than just burning coal at power plants.”
Kravchenko has been tracking health issues in communities near active and closed coal plants in North Carolina and found that public health impacts continue even after coal plants have shut down because of the coal ash left behind.
At mining sites, “there’s lead, there’s mercury, there’s arsenic, there’s chromium, and [these] toxic heavy metals are known to impact the nervous system,” said Karen Hadden, executive director of the Sustainable Energy and Economic Development Coalition and a board member of the Texas chapter of the Physicians for Social Responsibility. “They can affect the developing brains of children and cause permanent brain damage.”
Beck, the Alcoa spokesperson, directed questions about the landfill to Luminant, which purchased the landfill property from Alcoa in June 2018. He noted that the groundwater around the landfill is not connected to the main aquifer under Alcoa property and that Alcoa’s testing of groundwater on its property didn’t show contamination. “The water quality is appropriate for the property that is being marketed,” he said.
Meranda Cohn, a spokesperson for Luminant, criticized the Environmental Integrity Project’s analysis, calling it “misleading” and not “considered statistically valid.” She said the landfill is in compliance with all groundwater protection standards.
The groundwater in the two-county region that includes the Sandow mine is managed by the Post Oak Savannah Groundwater Conservation District, located about 10 miles down the road from Rockdale in Milano. Gary Westbrook, the district’s manager, said it had not done its own testing at the former mine site because it has no regulatory authority, but is “keeping the public apprised” and posting information about coal ash on its website.
Westbrook said he has had meetings with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the state environmental agency responsible for regulating coal plants and coal ash. A spokesperson for the agency said it plans to propose state rules for coal ash disposal next month and said that once the rules have been finalized, it “will take appropriate actions to monitor compliance at the 17 coal plants located in Texas, including pursuing enforcement for documented violations of the rule requirements.”
Meanwhile, the residents of Rockdale continue holding out hope that Sandow Lakes Ranch finally attracts new businesses.
When Amazon was soliciting proposals for its second headquarters last year, Rockdale and Milam County pitched the Alcoa property as a potential location with “boundless opportunities.” The pitch — as with more than 200 other proposals — lost out to Northern Virginia and New York City.
The Lower Colorado River Authority and Brazos River Authority, two powerful water districts in Central Texas, also showed interest in recent years, seemingly lured by the water rights that came with the land. Both decided against bids for the property.
Last year, Bitmain, a Japanese company that mines the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, announced plans to turn Alcoa’s former smelter into the world’s largest Bitcoin-producing facility. But after the value of the cryptocurrency plummeted by half late last year, Bitmain delayed its planned $500 million investment and started a leaner operation just last month. It now estimates it will create 50 jobs instead of the original 400 to 600 it forecast.
Lanna Caldwell, 62, owns an antique shop downtown and has lived most of her life in Rockdale. Both her husband and father spent much of their careers working at the Alcoa smelter. She said local officials keep telling residents that something good and big is coming. She’s heard that one buyer has plans to build a large business, “almost like a mall,” on the site.
“It sure sounds promising if they would do something like that that would bring people into our town,” she said. “Something for the economy would be great.”
But Dhaliwal, the gas station owner, seemed glum about the prospects for a revival in Rockdale.
“The town seems to be cursed with optimism,” he said. “They always hope something is going to come through.”

Trump, the noted classicist and civil engineer, told an audience assembled near the Mexican border that millennia of human history has shown that “there are some things that work…and a wall works. Nothing like a wall.”
Alas, a new report from the Washington Post suggests that Trump’s vaunted border wall is… not a thing that works. This should come as no surprise—as long as there have been walls, there have been people going around, over, under, or through them. According to Border Patrol agents and construction experts familiar with the barrier, Trump’s new wall design doesn’t sound hard to overcome, as people have already proven, again and again:
Administration officials argue the wall still provides a helpful barrier in conjunction with remote monitoring and boots on the ground, but no one expects that it will stop smugglers from illegally crossing.
“The cartels will continue to innovate, and they’re not just going to leave San Diego because the wall gets better,” says Ronald Vitiello, a former chief of U.S. Border Patrol and acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the Post.
Joshua Holmes, a Border Patrol agent and union official, agreed, telling the paper: “What happens any time some barrier is thrown up in front of a business is they adapt, and that’s all they’re trying to do.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Beto O’Rourke announced he was dropping out of the Democratic presidential primary, just a few hours before he was scheduled to speak at the Iowa Democratic party conclave formerly known as the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner—the event that helped propel Barack Obama’s candidacy 12 years ago. Instead, the man who’d once drawn serious comparisons to the 44th president (and been egged on by former Obama staffers) would be heading home to El Paso, personal and professional future TBD.
O’Rourke’s campaign ended far less dramatically than it started—with the candidate posed, Reagan-like, on the cover of Vanity Fair—but if we’re being honest, almost every campaign does. It is the nature of presidential politics to take smart candidates who have succeeded at virtually everything else and make them look like idiots. (Also, there are lots of idiot candidates who continue to look like idiots, and sometimes idiot candidates who are unfortunately made to look smart—tag yourself!)
But the end of the road this time was all the more striking given what preceded it. O’Rourke’s 2018 campaign against Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was one of the more remarkable losing campaigns in a generation, a relentless 20-month push that defied conventional norms about how to campaign. His presidential campaign was… well, it wasn’t like that.
The O’Rourke who entered the race as an almost-frontrunner was a different candidate from the one who finished it, and—though there was a lot to say about the first version—the second one was more compelling. It wasn’t until O’Rourke’s polling flagged and he dropped out of the top tier that he seemed to find his purpose. Then, his campaign changed for good after a white-supremacist gunman massacred Hispanic shoppers at a Walmart in his hometown of El Paso, O’Rourke became the candidate most singularly focused on gun violence. As Benjamin Wallace-Wells put it in the New Yorker this summer, he became “more marginal but more interesting: a protest candidate, an antiwar politician, for a different kind of war.”
Just days after the shooting, a reporter asked him if Trump could do anything to make things better. O’Rourke unloaded: “He’s been calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals—members of the press, what the fuck?” he said, asking reporters to “connect the dots” for themselves. As media criticism goes, it wasn’t half-bad.
After staking out newly aggressive policy positions on gun control, he demanded his rivals follow his lead. Most notably, he called for a mandatory buyback of assault rifles—a realization of decades of conservative propaganda about liberals coming for your guns, sure, but also a proposal that honestly grapples with the stockpile that would be left if all legislation did was halt new sales. “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15,” he said. No one else was so bold—Pete Buttigieg called him crazy, and O’Rourke, as my colleague Kara Voght pointed out, was staking out a position considerably more aggressive than what gun control advocates in the House were actually calling for. But it was something new.
If 2018 Beto was a mirror who reflected voters’ ideas about who he was, O’Rourke in 2019 was the inverse, trying to get the electorate to mirror his moves. It was a bet about where the progressive movement was headed, as well as an effort to lure them there. In some cases his instincts were misguided. O’Rourke’s desire to just let loose and channel the progressive id, perhaps, led him to call in September for churches who don’t recognize same-sex marriage to lose tax benefits—a position that conservatives were quick to weaponize and other Democrats avoided like a subway puddle. For all the right’s railings against the slippery slope to socialism, it might be these kinds of attacks on cultural shibboleths like gods and guns that conservatives fear most.
O’Rourke campaigned more than almost anyone else in the field—partly because he had no other job, sure, but also because the idea with O’Rourke has always been to be everywhere. His post-shooting itinerary brought him to Skid Row, to Black Wall Street, to Ciudad Juarez, and, just as he had in his Senate campaign, developed a reputation for barnstorming, standing on objects, holding forth and taking all questions. But the difference between doing that in Texas and doing that in Iowa is stark. People in Odessa might feel like they’ve been ignored by Democratic politicians all their lives. People in Cedar Rapids do not.
In the end there are many explanations for why O’Rourke failed. But the simplest one is universal—copy and paste it for the next time someone significant drops out, and for the time after that. He was not running against the most hated man in the Senate anymore. Instead, he was running against Barack Obama’s (or, please, just “Barack’s”) vice president, the 2016 primary runner-up, and a senator who has captivated so many progressives for so long that she has her own unofficial wing of the party named for her. As O’Rourke wished his supporters well and wrapped up the final rally of this campaign, another one was still going strong behind him—for supporters of a man who not long ago passed Beto in the polls, Andrew Yang.

Pelosi, who expressed similar sentiments to Bloomberg in a Friday TV interview, also took aim at the Green New Deal, a sweeping economic overhaul backed by Sanders and Warren to forestall the worst effects of climate change.

Her comments also come the day after, following weeks of questions, Warren released a funding plan to pay for her Medicare-for-all proposal.

It has, after all, rolled back Endangered Species Act protections, shrunk national monuments, and proposed opening the United States’ largest national forest up to logging and construction. But earlier this month, the administration announced it plans to designate more than 300,000 square nautical miles (that’s about 400,000 square miles) off the coasts of Alaska, California, Oregon, and Washington as critical habitat for three vulnerable humpback whale populations.
It’s great news, even if the Trump administration doesn’t seem to be totally acting of its own accord. The administration is required by law to designate critical habitat for endangered and threatened species where it is “prudent and determinable“—but it didn’t do so within the mandated timeframe that expired in late 2017, pushing environmental groups to sue and force the administration to comply with the law.
The designation comes at an urgent time for the whales. Even as most humpback populations worldwide have rebounded, a handful remain endangered or threatened. In 2016, at least 54 humpback whales were found caught in debris like rope or fishing gear off the West Coast, which that year saw its highest number of whale entanglements in recorded history, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Add to that the threats of global warming and noise pollution and the whales are in a precarious position. In one of the populations, for instance, there are fewer than 800 individual whales left, experts estimated in 2017, while other populations are made up of tens of thousands of individuals.
“We’re particularly happy that this critical habitat was proposed,” Catherine Kilduff, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, tells Mother Jones, “because that population really needs help—if it’s going to persist.”
The humpback whale was hunted over the course of centuries, pushing the species to the point of near extinction; it was listed as endangered in 1973, under the Endangered Species Act, and rebounded in large part due to the institution of hunting bans. In 2016, NOAA found that nine populations no longer warranted protection under the act, but five groups (known as “distinct population segments”) remained vulnerable. The change required the federal government to create and enforce critical habitat areas for the three populations that migrate to US waters and fall under US jurisdiction for protection.
That didn’t happen right away, though. The government, which had one year to act, blew past that deadline, prompting a lawsuit from environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, in March 2018. “There weren’t any signs that the Trump administration was going to follow through with that required habitat protection,” Kilduff says. (Lisa Manning, fisheries national listing coordinator at NOAA, denied that to Mother Jones, saying that the agency was “absolutely” going to designate critical habitat. She couldn’t say if the lawsuit made the process go any faster: “Getting a critical habitat rule done is really onerous,” she says, and even more so with three separate populations.) Following the suit, in August 2018, the Trump administration reached an agreement with the environmental groups to issue the protections.
“It is unfortunate that it took legal action against the Trump administration to secure protection for endangered humpback whales, but we are pleased to move forward with our efforts to create additional marine protected areas for threatened marine life,” Todd Steiner, an ecologist and executive director of Turtle Island Restoration Network, said in a press release.
The proposed critical habitat regulation was published in early October. It is now open to public comment and the final rule is due in September 2020.
In designating a “critical habitat,” NOAA isn’t creating a special conservation area like a marine sanctuary or marine reserve, in which the government may place strict restrictions on activities. The designation rather simply requires federal agencies to make sure any activity it funds or permits—for example, oil drilling—doesn’t harm those areas of humpback whale habitat. “If there’s a federal action that may be likely to adversely modify or destroy that critical habitat in the area that we drew,” Manning says, “then they have to consult with us.” It’s unclear how the rule will impact the fishing industry broadly, as only federally managed fisheries would be required to consult with NOAA.
Still, for endangered and threatened species, a “critical habitat” label can be, well, critical to survival. According to an analysis led by experts at the Center for Biological Diversity, species with critical habitats are “twice as likely to be improving” than those without them. Mapping out critical habitat also helps agencies in charge of conserving the species to know where to concentrate their efforts.
For marine animal activists, the new rule is a victory, but just one. Groups including the Center for Biological Diversity are still fighting the Trump administration on protections for Southern Resident killer whales, Cook Inlet beluga whales, and ice seals, among others.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Despite President Donald Trump’s efforts to curtail the Affordable Care Act—and a lawsuit that threatens the future of Obamacare—the 2020 market shows signs of increasing stability.
While the market was initially characterized by volatility, it’s now starting to stabilize, according to Cynthia Cox, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Many insurers set their prices too low when they first entered the market—the exchanges where individuals can purchase insurance plans each year—and they were forced to leave when they were unable to profit. To make the situation worse, most co-op health plans lacked the funding needed to be viable and were forced to close shop.
That trend has reversed in 2019 and 2020, with premiums slightly decreasing. “It’s not a dramatic change,” says Cox, “but it’s going in the right direction.” This year’s lower premiums suggest that insurers have priced their plans in such a way that they’re profitable, Cox says. The relative stability in the marketplace has also caused insurers to re-enter markets and expand into new territory, giving consumers more choice, according to Kathy Hempstead, the author of a new study on marketplace volatility released by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
Hempstead’s study highlights which counties across the country experienced the most dramatic fluctuations in insurer participation between 2015 and 2020. Certain metro areas, such as Nashville, Phoenix, and Atlanta, have seen many carrier changes, in part because they’re so desirable to insurers. These counties were initially served by many different insurers, who sometimes priced too low and were forced to exit the market. However, new insurers continue to enter these areas due to population growth, high populations of people who are uninsured or self-employed, or low hospital concentrations. The exact reasons for this volatility are unclear, Hempstead says, but “it’s interesting to figure out what it is…that has made so many carriers interested in serving those markets.” The map from RWJF below shows where in the country markets have been particularly volatile.
More counties will see an increase in insurers in 2020, Cox says, although many parts of the country will see no change between 2019 and 2020. Hempstead suggests that increased insurer participation could reflect the appeal of a direct-to-consumer market, on which many Democratic presidential candidates’ health care reform plans are based.
“It could be that carriers are sort of thinking the long game is markets like this, so let’s get into the ACA even if we’re not gonna make a boatload of money,” Hempstead says. Insurers’ interests aside, “it’s definitely better for consumers to have more people competing for their business.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But now a federal court has signaled that it could step in and even overturn the results if the Jim Crow-era provision determines the outcome of the race.
The provision, which was adopted into the state’s constitution in 1890, says that in order to win a statewide race, a candidate must win the majority of the popular vote and the majority of the state’s 122 House districts. That’s a far higher bar to clear, and if no candidate does so, the state House of Representatives gets to elect the winner. The state House is controlled by Republicans. The provision was created to rein in the growing political power of black Mississippians during Reconstruction, alongside poll taxes and literacy tests.
“This racist electoral scheme achieved, and continues to achieve, the framers’ goals by tying the statewide election process to the power structure of the House,” states a lawsuit challenging the provision. “So long as white Mississippians controlled the House, they would also control the elections of statewide officials.”
No other state uses such a process. It has rarely led to a vote in the state House; the last one was in 1999.
Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood are locked in a close contest for governor, with polls showing Reeves in the lead by only 1 to 3 points. As the race got underway this spring, four black voters filed a lawsuit against Mississippi’s top elections officer, Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, and House Speaker Philip Gunn to challenge the provision. The suit was backed by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, an organization led by Eric Holder, the first black attorney general.
On Friday, US District Judge Daniel P. Jordan III declined the plaintiffs’ request to issue a preliminary injunction against the state that would block the provision from being applied to Tuesday’s race. Jordan cited the timing of the case, noting that Mississippi’s election laws “are not merely statutes that can be revised in one legislative session; they are constitutional provisions that require amendment.”
But Jordan expressed “grave concern” regarding the constitutionality of the provision, stating that it would cause “irreparable harm if eventually applied.” Jordan wrote that the provision is the state’s responsibility to change, but he suggested that if it failed to do so and the results of the election were determined by the legislature, it might give the plaintiffs legal standing to move forward with the suit and potentially overturn the provision in court.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs in the case argued that Mississippi is currently gerrymandered to dilute the black vote, and that forcing statewide candidates to win a majority of these skewed congressional districts would violate the principle of “one person, one vote.” Jordan wrote in his decision that this was “arguably…their strongest claim.”
Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) told NPR prior to the judge’s ruling, “Whether it was the poll tax or the Black Code, there were a lot of things put in place [that] down through the years have been declared unconstitutional. To our knowledge, this is the last vestige of Southern discrimination in the electoral process.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Media","In Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators, Ronan Farrow tells the story of how NBC executives worked for months to try to kill the Harvey Weinstein exposé that would later earn Farrow a Pulitzer Prize. The primary villain of the book isn’t Weinstein; it’s the secret infrastructure that powerful people have built to silence critics and protect themselves from scrutiny.
“Things like the use of NDAs, and the use of private investigation firms to smear and surveil people, and the efforts to subvert the press and manipulate the press—I knew that those were bigger than Harvey Weinstein, bigger than the entertainment industry,” Farrow said. “Those are systemic and affect industry after industry, and there were Harvey Weinsteins all over the place.”
Weinstein used his relationships with top executives at the National Enquirer and NBC to bury stories about his predation. Farrow’s reporting reveals that Donald Trump used the National Enquirer to bury stories in a similar way—principally via “catch-and-kill,” whereby tabloids purchase the exclusive rights to damaging information about famous people and then bury the stories. (In his reporting, Farrow gained access to some documents that had been hidden away in the infamous “vault” of American Media Inc., the National Enquirer’s parent company, uncovering a trove of documents about President Trump’s affairs, some of them previously unreported.)
Catch and Kill is about these “instruments of suppression” that influential people use against the media, very often with the complicity of influential people within the media.
This week on the Mother Jones Podcast, our editor-in-chief, Clara Jeffery, speaks with Farrow about his explosive journalistic tell-all. The conversation took place during a recent live event in San Francisco, co-produced by Book Passage and the Curran Theater. Listen to the podcast or read the transcript below, which has been lightly edited and condensed.


Let me congratulate you on Catch and Kill, which I tore through this weekend, and also congratulate you on the announcement of your engagement to [Pod Save America host] Jon Lovett.
Thank you! God bless that man for putting up with me. It is not easy. I think the book is brutally honest about how not fun I can be to date.
Seems like it’s a brutally honest portrait of two people who never sleep, but uh…
Yeah for sure.
So reporters often avoid the “how I got that story” frame and shy away from the first person altogether. But this book is more than a retelling of the stories you wrote for the New Yorker. You’re the book’s main character, not Harvey Weinstein, not his victims or the other perpetrators. Why did you feel this was the best way to advance our understanding of what you had already written?
The book is very forthright about this classic reporter struggle of not wanting to be the story, and in fact has many scenes of me, and when I say “scenes” it’s a thing that actually happened, it’s a work of nonfiction. Me sitting on air and dodging questions from tough journalists about the story behind the story, and these vast systems that conspired to keep the truth quiet for so long.
And I sat there and dodged and weaved and said I want the focus to be on these incredibly brave women that have come forward and on the underlying allegations, and all of that was true, but as source after source began to come forward to describe what ultimately became the plot of Catch and Kill, and these revelations in the worlds of media and politics and private espionage, I realized that this story of instruments of suppression was as important as all these journalists had said, and that to tell it required brutal honesty and it required being sort of vulnerable about myself and my own role in it and the way I was targeted alongside sources. And I realized that would take two years of reporting to get right ’cause it involved a lot of investigative journalism.
In the past 10 days since the book has come out and got its real press run, NBC has continued to stick by the assertion that you didn’t have the story. And yet, and I say this as an editor, seven weeks later you published a print piece that had to be far enough along to go through rigorous editing, lawyering, fact-checking with editors you’d essentially just met. Uhh, that’s a lotta bullshit.
Yes, this is why we love Clara! Yeah, that is a lot of bullshit. It just is. The indisputable point is the one you just made. It actually is four weeks between when the New Yorker greenlit this story and when we put it out, and, yes, we had multiple named women in every draft of the story at NBC, and we had an audiotape from this police sting operation of Harvey Weinstein admitting to not just one sexual assault but serial sexual assaults, and a vast majority of women talking about a pattern of predation. All of that was in the NBC story. And, look, it’s all in the book—you can judge for yourself whether it should have been on air. But there is no arguing I took it across the street to another outlet. They said, oh my god, let’s get this out as quickly as possible, and then it was a Pulitzer Prize–winning story in a few weeks.
You know the fundamental offensive here. I get these kind of smear tactics, spin machines, and legal threats on every story I do. It’s just part of the occupational hazard of investigative journalism. It’s not new or surprising. All of these rebuttals are reflected in the book because we fact-checked and fact-checked and scrubbed every sentence, and you’ll see it’s very measured and very fair, including to NBC. Their responses are in there, but the misdirection of what has become a full-time job for a group of executives trying to tell the press over and over again that there wasn’t a “there there” to the Harvey Weinstein story is that it covers up the fact that the complaint was that they ordered us to stop reporting.
My producer, Rich McHugh, an incredibly brave journalist who refused to stop and didn’t take the orders to shut this down, lost his job ultimately for speaking out about this in the company, a real profile in courage. He’s written about this recently, that we were ordered over and over to cancel interviews with rape victims, to not take a single call. And that is not journalistic behavior.
It’s interesting because two years ago, when NBC made these criticisms, it seemed cowardly at the time, but it also seemed like, okay, maybe there was this bit of, “Well, we didn’t have the stuff you need for TV. We didn’t have enough on camera. We didn’t have enough visuals.” But actually you had quite a number of sources willing to go on, and not just in shadow.
That’s exactly right. I mean, Rose McGowan has been very vocal in recent days saying that is not true, that she did go on the record and she showed her face and did this incredibly brave thing and for months and months hung in there, as there was this kind of prevarication from NBC and these mixed signals. And ultimately she was spooked, but the moment she fell out of that story, another incredibly brave source, Emily Nestor, volunteered to take an interview that she had given before with her face in shadow. This is a common technique in television, by the way. Almost all of my investigative stories before this had people with their faces in shadow. This is not something that TV producers typically object to. And it would have never been all women you don’t see. There were multiple named women.
But Emily Nestor did this incredibly brave thing, volunteered to reshoot her interview, even though she was scared—her mom was scared of retaliation. And it is a real disservice to people as brave as Emily Nestor that there’s a group of executives of a certain kind of thinking, certain age, certain kind of profile, these guys who have banded together and tried to undercut those sources, including lying about them. They’re running around telling the press these women weren’t brave enough to go on camera. And Emily Nestor, would she really have gone on camera? Well, she offered to and they declined it, and she’s said that on the record. So thank god for reporters who see the facts and take them where they should go, which is to publication in this case. Thank god for David Remnick, thank god for the Emily Nestors of the world who won’t shut up, and to the moms who raised them right to do that.
So several top NBC news executives—Andy Lack, Noah Oppenheim, Phil Griffin—have skeletons in their own closet re harassment or unsavory suggestions in meetings, or writings they did in college which aren’t just anti-feminist but directly hostile to women. When you started to report this book and get into these backstories, was that the first thing you said: Oh maybe that’s the reason they’re against it? Was that the thing that started to trip you up?
I think both things are true. The reporting began to solidify against one thing that was happening, which was a very specific plot about what secrets this company held, and the reporting on that began to coalesce first.
So this was about the NDAs they had the folks sign?
Right. This group of executives and lawyers at this company were arguing that it was not appropriate to report on secret sexual harassment settlements. And what I document in this book is, that was an argument given to them by Harvey Weinstein, that in at least 15 secret calls with Harvey Weinstein they’ve now admitted they promised to kill the story and yielded to his argument that you cannot report on secret settlements because you’ll open yourself up to lawsuits. And at the same time they were vulnerable to that argument, because in a period when they had previously lied to their own journalists and said we don’t have any settlements, they in fact had at least seven. I tell the stories of some of those, and this was a company that was enforcing exactly the pacts of silence that Harvey relied on within its own midst, and that included a number of cases involving Matt Lauer. It included cases involving senior executives.
And it’s a great illustration of how when you cover up a problem and pay out women with allegations, and potentially men, but in this case it was women, to make them go away, people can get hurt. Because serial alleged predators stay in positions of power. And the truth can get hurt, because when you’re a media organization, very rapidly it becomes a conflict of interest, that you’re making these arguments about what should and shouldn’t be reported on while you yourself have a stake in upholding that silence.
This claim that came ultimately through Harvey Weinstein, that this was tortious interference, that essentially if the women broke their NDA somehow, you and NBC could be sued for facilitating that in some capacity—they never made that threat to the Times, I think you report in the book. So I’m curious what you think about that.
The Washington Post did a great side-by-side chart, by Erik Wemple at the Post, of all the moments of the pivotal progression of my story and the Times story. We at the New Yorker reported the first allegations of assault and rape about Harvey Weinstein. At the Times they did a separate story about the first allegations of verbal harassment, and you see this striking context of—literally the Post did a table where they get their first big lead. Dean Bacquet at the Times and their editors are like, great, go for it, track it down, stop at nothing, and NBC is like, you should probably stop making calls. Just over and over again. Like you gotta stop. This would be a great magazine piece—can’t you do this for someone else? Wouldn’t it be great if you did it for someone else? I don’t know, tortious interference. And the tortious interference thing is particularly crazy for me as an attorney. I just went to my 10-year reunion two nights ago.
Ronan’s 31, but we’ll come back to that subject.
Don’t hoot and holler that much because by the 10-year law school reunion, I have news for you, everyone’s dealing with complicated child care situations and it is not very lit. 9 p.m. is kind of bed time for 10-year reunion. But one thing I do remember from law school is that tortious interference is a doctrine that usually gets invoked in cases involving completely different kinds of things: if you are deliberately and maliciously trying to frustrate someone’s contract because you’re a competitor of theirs. You know, if I were a rival studio head trying to get Harvey’s employees to break some element of their contract to benefit my business and hurt his, that’s your classic tortious interference case. What there is not is abundant case law showing successful judgment against news organizations acting in the public interest. And the most prominent invocation of tortious interference as a specious legal rationale for shutting down a story, of course, for anyone who follows journalism books and movies, is The Insider. Remember The Insider? Russell Crowe in the fat suit or whatever. Wonderful performance. Jeffrey Wigand, whistleblower, on the big tobacco story. And in that case CBS’s parent company gets involved and they start talking about tortious interference. And it’s literally the stereotype of a fake legal argument from a parent company.
And one that a network felt an unbelievable amount of shame and opprobrium from the profession for ceding to that, like it’s the biggest case we have: Don’t do that, your peers will not look kindly on you.
Right! And as my producer and I sat there and were told by the parent company that we needed to be worried about tortious interference, we just kept saying, like, has nobody seen The Insider?
Paging Christopher Plummer.
My partner Jon is howling through all of this, but The Insider, can’t they just rent it? For what it’s worth, just about any legal question like this you can spin it in a way where you take it more seriously, but the New Yorker’s general counsel, who’s a very sober media attorney, Fabio Bertoni, just sort of wrinkled up his nose and looked puzzled that I’d been talking about tortious interference. And said there’s no case law that suggests that’s a problem in this kind of situation.
Just as an aside, it’s infuriating that a network with near bottomless pockets and scads of in-house lawyers is so chickenshit. When smaller organizations that really do risk being, and in the case of Gawker have been, driven out of business by frivolous suits don’t have that luxury and yet still fight the good fight.
And a great counterpoint there is the New Yorker, which is still a much smaller and less monied enterprise, and looked at this same body of evidence and said not only are we not yielding to Harvey’s threats, we are informing him that we find these threats to be specious because he was attacking me and coming at me with all sorts of personal legal threats, too. They offered to retain an attorney for me. They really pulled out all the stops to stand by this, and that’s part of a journalistic outlet’s obligation, to go into battle if that’s worth it. And the Times was ready to be sued and the New Yorker was ready to be sued, and I think with good attorneys safeguarding the reporting who knew anyone can threaten anything, and it doesn’t actually mean they’ve got a good case.
So the New York Times’ Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey were working. You guys were racing each other,, and reporters are competitive and hate to get beat on any even small element of a story, but from the 5,000-foot perspective, do you think having two such prestigious outlets landing such huge stories within a week really helped turn the Weinstein story and the #MeToo movement into a juggernaut?
Hugely so. And it was very inspiring to me. Part of the plot that unravels in Catch and Kill is me being very alone for long swaths of time. That’s why there’s been all of this misinformation. NBC literally hired a Wikipedia whitewasher to scrub and distort and remove references to all of these scandals from executives’ pages. A news organization did this. They admitted to it. And the comments are so transparent by the way.
“Matt Lauer is a great human being.”
To this day Wikipedia is stripped of references to all this stuff, but it’s a good lesson in how fragile all this is and how people need to object when the deck is stacked and you have paid solutions to these problems that can eclipse any of the normal systems in place. Thank god we have outlets like the New Yorker willing to go into battle, because we might not be having this conversation otherwise. But I talk about being in the thick of all of that and feeling very alone, and one of the pieces of misinformation inserted into Wikipedia was, it took two months for the New Yorker to do this story, and you have Noah Oppenheim yelling at people in this book. You know, David Remnick sat on stuff for years and now I’m the villain! Nobody sat on anything at the New Yorker, I can tell you firsthand. I was out in the cold with no news outlet, paying out of pocket to keep these interviews going for weeks, and the New Yorker greenlit the piece, and four weeks later it was in print. They had to do a titanic amount of work, as you can imagine, turning something like this into a New Yorker piece and giving me the greenlight to continue to take calls. That was the big shift. At NBC I was being stopped. The moment I was able to act on those leads of course it coalesced more, so there was additional reporting. But by and large I was alone.
Knowing the Times was on the story was hugely important to me. It was a lifeline. It was bizarre when I told that to my bosses at NBC, and they said sometimes it’s good for someone else to go first. I had that reaction, too, and even when it was this sort of white-knuckle race to the finish, where I was very frightened that I was going to get scooped and no one would know I had done all this, I was very honest in the book about these selfish moments where I was like, oh shit, I swung too wide, this was too big a gamble. You’re absolutely right that the one-two punch of two big outlets landing these completely different stories about different aspects of this ensured that this was a moment people paid attention to.
At a certain moment I wondered if you and Jodi and Megan had a Slack chat where you’re like, oh my god, all this stuff was coming in, why don’t you guys go after that one. I’ll go do Les Moonves.
Well, they went on book leave because they’re not insane. They’re like adults who have to organize their time and also have to take care of their kids and stuff, so they holed up in Brooklyn and were working on their book, and we would see each other at events and stuff, and they’d be like, we’re cranking away at our book and I’d be over deadline on my book because I had this torrent of other leads. I probably should’ve had the discipline they did and just go straight into the book, but what happened was, I broke a bunch of other stories back to back, was exhausted, and then in a blind panic about the book. So my editors are stressed out of their minds. Everyone’s telling me there’s no physical capacity to print this book in time. I think Jodi and Megan are better with deadlines, among many other wonderful things about them.
And I have to say, for all you must have rushed toward the end, I did not find a copy-editing mistake in that book, which is unusual when something comes that fast and furious.
Thank you! Well, this is spoken like a savvy editor. Can we have a moment of applause for fact-checkers and copy editors? Because this book is made possible by both of those categories of people. Sean Lavery, one of the heads of fact-checking at the New Yorker, did so much hard work, literally was on the phone with some very angry executives at a company that shall remain unnamed, for like 11 hours, until 3 a.m., and got a nosebleed afterward from stress. This guy really got put through the wringer and made sure every sentence was so fair and so measured and nuanced. And there’s been no surprises in the response to the book as a result. And then the copy-editing process, we had so little time, and I pushed this publisher Little, Brown so hard to put resources into it— we’ve just got to copy edit and re–copy edit every page. Everything had to be proofed because anything could’ve been a vulnerability. We knew there would be so much scrutiny, and we got it done. I can’t believe we got it done.
I think one of the gut punches, aside from the stories of the women themselves and the abuse they suffered, was the realization that such civil rights heroes like David Boies and Lisa Bloom were not only working for Harvey, but…
I think that hiss was quite fair based on the available evidence…
But were really duplicitous on a bunch of different levels, and you can’t probably go into them all, but do you want to hit a highlight or two?
Yeah, sure. There are so many highlights to choose from in the canon of Lisa Bloom duplicity in this book. Where to start? I mean, Lisa Bloom is a particularly striking example. There could also be a book about David Boies and the way he’s dealt with reporters on this, on the Bad Blood story about Theranos. Big Carreyrou fans over here. Me, too. Very good book, Bad Blood, and very poor showing by our friend David Boies. I will say, though, that it’s a little facetious to say Lisa Bloom is worse, and it’s not my job to say anyone is worse or bad or anything, but she should not be a member of any bar or legal organization.
I was really wondering if anything either one of them did was grounds for disbarment. I mean, for Boies working both sides of the aisle…
In both cases there are these kinds of wild conflicts of interest and acts of deception. Boies, when I obtained these contracts he’d signed in his own fancy signature, ordering former Mossad agents to shut down reporting on Weinstein, including the Times reporting, as he was representing the Times, when I presented it to him—first of all, one interesting thing about David Boies is, he does play ball with reporters in a way that’s quite smart from a self-protection standpoint, but also almost on some level noble. I mean, he admitted on the record to that being his signature, and those being the contracts, and in one sense that’s just ’cause I had him dead to rights, but in another sense he could have put up more of a fight, and he didn’t, and he confessed everything, so he’s like a villain who does the big confessional speech at the end of the movie, and he actually compares himself to a villain in the Mission Impossible series in this book, which is really a weird thing to do.
Which villain was this?
Well, that’s actually the weirdest part. It wasn’t even a good villain. It was Billy Crudup in Mission: Impossible III, who’s not the main villain in that movie, which is also maybe deliberate on his part. So that was one of the weird things that happened in this book. But Lisa Bloom, on the other hand—I was gonna say it would be facetious to say she’s worse, but certainly what I can speak to without passing judgment on her soul as a human being, which is not my job, it’s someone’s job. I think she’s getting a lot of that from the victims of Harvey Weinstein, who she gaslit and smeared, and that’s fair of them to do, but it’s not my job. But I can speak to my own experience and I can say that Lisa Bloom’s betrayals and hypocrisy hit me harder because you have to bear in mind this was a woman who had been this ardent defender of women, had built a career and a reputation on integrity of that kind and on that issue, had written op-ed after op-ed on my sister, and talking about how the forensic evidence backed up my sister’s claim, and how brave my sister was to come forward, who had been a regular on my cable news program decrying the kind of circles of mutual protection and power that shield predators in Hollywood. And then was filing expense reports with Harvey Weinstein saying like, I’m gonna do an opposition operation on Ronan, dangling her female clients as bait, saying I can give you an exclusive with Blac Chyna if you just talk to me and tell me what you’re reporting on. Posing as a friend and someone I could trust and giving me assurances she would not reveal our conversations to Harvey Weinstein, and then turning around at the end of that strange summer and saying—when I said, “Lisa, you promised you wouldn’t tell his people,”—“Oh Ronan, I am his people.” It’s unbelievable. She has apologized for that, and maybe that’s sincere.
And is this just greed?
I think it’s just greed. I’ve talked to friends of hers, and the full thing she says in that conversation is, “Ronan, I am his people, he optioned my movie, I’ve been in this really awkward position.” But she sure as hell leaned into destroying these women. Another attorney on Harvey Weinstein’s evil legal team said to me, “None of us, the evil attorneys, could believe how Lisa Bloom relished tearing these women apart.” And I don’t know what’s going on there. She had some pent-up issues.
How much overlap is there between the Harvey protection racket and the Trump protection racket?
A lot. Both are major themes of Catch and Kill. This book is about Donald Trump, too. I follow a trail of clues in this book, from Dylan Howard of the National Enquirer—a big fan of Catch and Kill, hired lawyers at great personal cost in every region of the world to threaten to sue booksellers who carry this fine book here. Prevailed in those legal threats in Australia. This book was banned in Australia thanks to Dylan Howard. Then there was too much demand, and they’re selling it now. Which is, jokes aside, another example of the ways in which specious legal threats can end up suppressing the truth. You had a country not reading a book that had a lot of news value for that country, because Dylan Howard is Australian—he’s a major character in it because big companies, including Amazon Australia, just buckled and thought it wasn’t worth the trouble, even though it was a truly ridiculous threat. This is all very careful and fair to Dylan Howard.
Another subissue highlighted by this: We are very lucky in this country to have the protection of the First Amendment. Not everywhere does, so you would very likely not see that kind of ban on a book in the United States, and we’ve all got to fight like hell to uphold the First Amendment, and other countries need to reform when they have these laws that facilitate frivolous defamation suits. The UK did a bunch of reforms. Australia has these legacy UK laws, and it’s a really bad situation for freedom of information and the truth in that country.
But I follow a trail of clues from a story I broke about Dylan Howard and the Enquirer killing stories on behalf of Harvey Weinstein and being basically an attack dog for Harvey Weinstein, digging up information, secretly recording people who might have adverse information about his accusers. It’s pretty ugly stuff, and there’s a paper trail on it that I document in the book. And then I’m led from that ultimately to a series of revelations about how Donald Trump and his team used the Enquirer in a very similar way during the 2016 election. And there are revelations in this book about new instances of them collaborating closely.
So not to name-check every journalism movie out there, but this section of the book is sort of part Sweet Smell of Success, part L.A. Confidential, where it’s just…
I like these comparisons. Thank you.
…”Cat’s in the bag, bag’s in the river.” You know, just these sort of gatherings, real or fake, to lord over people or have as an insurance policy. You ultimately saw an inventory of items in the so-called vault of AMI, National Enquirer, that had been gathered about Trump. And you say, intriguingly, including affairs that have not yet been reported on. Should they be?
The question of affairs is always a complicated one in this kind of reporting. My view is, if an affair corroborates some kind of an MO that then extends to more serious or criminal behavior, then that is worth talking about. A story like Eric Schneiderman, where some of the stories involved consensual relationships in which he was nonconsensually then beating women up, that’s an example of talking about affairs can be fair game because within those affairs there’s a subset of behaviors that is newsworthy. I think, in cases where someone is having affairs within the workplace and then retaliating against people, I mean Andy Lack, the head of the NBC News Group, there’s multiple women on the record talking about when they were associate producers, or talent on his shows, that he would pursue them relentlessly and then be kind of nasty to them afterwards and freeze them out of work opportunities. And he denies the retaliation, but not the sleeping with underlings.
In one case his response to one of these claims was that he didn’t see how he could have retaliated because he didn’t recall the affair ending. So that was a novel response. The affair did end, to be clear, and quite unhappily, and she did feel she was retaliated against. I think those are valid subjects because when someone is making news judgment decisions about whether it’s a matter of public interest to disclose Harvey Weinstein’s predations within the office, and when that informs a kind of baseline of views on women and how to treat people in the workplace and power dynamics, that’s all fair game. I think if something is truly a consensual affair, that’s not the kind of thing I’ve ever or would ever report on. Yet the closest that I’ve come to it, and this shows up in this book, if there are transactions around a non-newsworthy affair that then make it newsworthy, the concealment of some consensual affairs by the National Enquirer, of Trump’s affairs, became a real matter of the national interest to disclose.
AMI, ultimately, after doing a lot of lying to me, there was a lot of Dylan Howard and the general counsel at the National Enquirer lying through their teeth saying they never collaborated with Trump at all—we just killed these news stories because they didn’t meet the National Enquirer’s exacting standards for publication. We just paid them a lot of money and then the reporting didn’t check out. Obviously this didn’t turn out to be the case. They signed a non-prosecution in the end with the Southern District of New York saying, yes, we lied, just kidding about all that journalistic stuff, we had a deal with Trump, and here’s how it played out, and, yes, it could have been a violation of election law. And we promise not to do any more crimes for, I think it’s three years. Seriously, it’s a crazy agreement. Oh yeah, there’s a window in which they can’t do crimes anymore.
Set your clocks.
Yeah, set your clocks! And there’s all these questions about whether they’ve violated that agreement since then by inter alia blackmailing Jeff Bezos, which is a thing they do in the plot of this book. Karen McDougal had an affair with Trump, which was totally consensual and who cares, but it then became a very probable violation of election law that the now-president collaborated with a media outlet to catch and kill the story. I felt very comfortable reporting on that and making it clear that the news was the transaction, not the affair.
Can you give us a bit of hint into the trickiest bits of reporting? For example, you offer up dialogue of calls between Weinstein and various officials at NBC. Are we to gather that such calls are either recorded or that assistants at one end or the other or somebody sits in on them?
While for source protection reasons I cannot always answer that for a given conversation, I have a general answer to that question which I can give you because it’s the very first thing in the book. I’ll read you the author’s note, which gets at this question in some detail and considerable caution:
“Catch and Kill is based on two years of reporting. It draws on interviews with more than 200 sources as well as hundreds of pages of contracts, emails, and texts, and dozens of hours of audio. It was subjected to the same standard of fact-checking as the New Yorker stories on which it is based. All of the dialogue in the book is drawn directly from contemporaneous accounts and records. Because this is a story about surveillance, third parties often witnessed or surreptitiously recorded conversations, and I was sometimes able to obtain their testimonials and records. I adhered to legal and ethical standards when creating my own recordings.”
So you know there’s a variety of sources, but what I can say is, when you are reading an exact quote in this book, it is memorialized in some incontrovertible way. And you will notice that amidst much furor and pushback on this book, there has been no disputation of a single quote.
So you went to college at 11. I can’t stop laughing at that.
I went through a Doogie Howser phase. And you know what’s the worst? My mom, who’s an amazing person, my mom is so brave. She’s so ahead of the curve on these issues, she stood by a sexual assault survivor at a time when everyone called her crazy for it, and when the full attack machine of a powerful person was coming at her and she was getting smeared and blacklisted because the oldest tactic in the book is to blame the mother even though she had nothing to do with this allegation—all she did was refuse to bury it. And god bless that woman. But I will hold her accountable for this: She did give me a bowl haircut when I went to college at 11. And it just wasn’t necessary to double my trouble when I already did not fit in. I will say I had big glasses and I looked very adorable in retrospect.
Okay, well after that—you graduated at 15 or something—you went on to get a law degree from Yale. There’s a PhD in there somewhere.
I finished the PhD.
There’s Rhodes Scholarship.
There was a Rhodes Scholarship in there, a PhD in there. Do we have any grad students here tonight? Okay, we got some grad students. So for every grad student out there, particularly working grad students, I worked throughout this PhD and was wonderfully privileged to be able to juggle these things and not have to deal with family stuff at the time. I was okay financially. And I know it’s much harder for a great many people. But it is nevertheless, for someone in my position, I’m breaking all these stories in the book, I’m going through the events of this book, I’m also trying to make PhD deadlines, and I tell you all of this so you can draw strength from the fact that it took me a full seven years to finish that PhD. I just finished it in January. I am very glad that that’s over, I’m very grateful to the Oxford professors who tolerated my rolling back into Oxford every six months or whatever for various oral exams because you have to defend the thing over and over again.
I feel like we are one on this.
Who among us hasn’t? And they would sort of look at me quizzically and say, depending on which year it was, “We heard maybe you’re anchoring an American television show every day?” And I’m like, that is a side job, and my main passion is this dissertation. And then they’re like, “We heard you won a Pulitzer Prize?” And they’re like, “You’re doing investigative reporting?” Side project. Passion is my foreign policy PhD.
And somehow during #MeToo reporting you also wrote a book on the end of diplomacy and the decline of American influence, which seems…prescient.
War on Peace, get it on Amazon. I’m very proud of it. And the throughline in both of these books is that a lot of brave whistleblowers made both possible.
Okay, anyway, you’re no slouch. But I wanted to get into, for this book, how much, when you were trying to crack the world of Harvey Weinstein, did being sort of third-generation Hollywood “royalty,” for lack of a better word, help you? Did you know the byways better than most reporters, like have some access to some angles?
Part of the book’s plot is how that got weaponized against me and was not always a positive. On the other hand I think you’re probably right that I was a known quantity in a way that was slightly helpful. You’d have to ask the sources. I think that the decisions people were making about coming forward were so wrenching and life-altering that no credential could really sway that so substantively. What I saw was that people made a decision that I can’t take credit for at all. People were either deciding to take that leap or not based on an analysis of harm to them, weighed against the greater good, and chance at protecting other people going forward. So Mira Sorvino and Annabella Sciorra and Rosanna Arquette and Emily Nestor, Ambra Gutierrez, who does this incredible high-wire act in this book, we reveal for the first time that she preserved evidence and got it out. Just amazing people, and they took those risks because they decided they were going to do a brave thing. The reporter who was there with them, I don’t want to say was secondary because reporters do incredible work on this kind of stuff every day, and we need reporters out there pushing sources to take that leap, for sure. But I also want to make clear that they had the agency here and they did the brave thing, and I don’t know what good and bad parts of my personal baggage and history helped or hindered that, but I’m glad it went the way it did.
Do you think knowing your sister was a survivor of sexual assault or abuse helped them be able to unburden themselves to you? Did it help you know how to communicate to them?
I think that was the most direct link in that category of personal things that contributed. Rose McGowan raised it in our early conversations and had seen that I had gone through this journey of initially telling my sister to move on, and wondering whether it was worth the fight for her to maintain her claim as she has consistently year after year. And I’m very nakedly honest about that evolution, that I went from that to gradually realizing that she was right, both in the sense that the evidence was on her side and also in the sense that she had been courageous to stick to her guns, and it was worth every ounce of inconvenience for those of us around her. In the sense that this was a big scandal that blew up and triggered all this blowback for all of us every time she spoke, my mother, but also me, and Rose among others had seen that I’d had that evolution, and written an op-ed talking about how we needed to ask tougher questions and how my sister’s claim had been ignored for too long. And I did help people understand that while I was an arm’s-length reporter who was coming fresh to the Harvey Weinstein case, I did have some understanding of the stakes of the issue and the vast machines that women went up against as they spoke about this.
O’Reilly, Trump, two-plus years of #MeToo reporting have been both edifying for women but also so triggering and traumatic, hearing all these stories, reliving their own cases of sexual abuse. And I have to say, just watching you back in the little gathering here before, to see so many people—and I was across the room, I wasn’t overhearing them—but come up, and it seemed so clear that they’re looking to you to maybe unburden themselves, maybe thank you. You’re getting a lot at you, and that’s gotta be really hard. And I just was wondering if you could talk a little about it. I know you’re always putting the victims ahead of your own story in that way, but it’s difficult to be the receptacle of that and to honor it.
Well, thank you. That’s very compassionate of you to view it that way. To sound like a broken record, I would point out that it’s harder for the people who come up and say, hey, this happened to me, and to share their stories. And I’m always grateful. Many of you who were here tonight did that in that gathering, and I’m always just profoundly grateful—first of all because, if you’ve read the book, I also get a lot of threats and people wanting to kill me or smear me or blackmail me. So thank you for not doing any of that. That’s a start. And separately I know that it takes guts to say those things. And there’s various forms of it. People outright come and tell their stories, or just say something significant, or there’s a meaningful look and a “hey, thanks.” And everyone has their own way of expressing this, but it is tremendously galvanizing to me to have people come up and say that the work matters.
It also means a lot to me when reporters come up and say it’s meant something to them or inspired them in some way. I hope I have the opportunity to be in receipt of newsworthy leads, and if you have one, if you’re sitting on a piece of evidence, it’s ronan_farrow@newyorker.com. Please don’t hesitate. I’m grateful for every person who continues to care and rally around it. Writing this book, I knew I’d get a heap of shit from a lot of powerful people and there would be these kinds of threats, and that’s fine. My only job is to keep my head down and be really rigorous in the reporting and fact-checking, and I’ve done that, but it still makes a difference to see both people in the media and people in the public really stand behind it and cut through those threats and the spin and the distortions.
Until you started doing this reporting, and even after you started meeting ordinary people telling their stories about abuse at the hands of nonfamous or powerful men, did you know how wide and deep and profound a problem this is?
I didn’t have a crystal ball, and again I didn’t have a lot of time or bandwidth to think about the wider world. I very much was in the rabbithole of thinking about this crazy international espionage plot. Which can be distracting, it turns out. But I did know that I was reporting on issues that were important partly because they were structural and that things like the use of NDAs and the use of private investigation firms to smear and surveil people, and the efforts to subvert the press and manipulate the press, I knew that those were bigger than Harvey Weinstein, bigger than the entertainment industry, that those are systemic and affect industry after industry and that there were Harvey Weinsteins all over the place. So I was not surprised to see this outpouring of brave people refusing to stop speaking about it. I was grateful, and I’ve been bowled over by the enormity of it, but I wasn’t surprised.
Do you think you’re still being surveilled?
Well, that starts to intersect with ongoing reporting, so I’m not going to answer that.
Very intriguing. Backing up to one of the things you do write about, one of the great flips in the book is one of the guys working for Black Cube, maybe two still, they started flipping on this black-ops surveillance group, other conflicting and overlapping groups. When did that information come in? Because in the book you weave it in in real time. You know, when people were out in cars, they seem hapless, I have to say.
There’s a little bit of a comedy of errors with the espionage plots on the ground level. There’s a Russian and a Ukrainian guy. They’re working long hours and peeing into bottles, and they spend several days following a neighbor of mine who looks a little bit like me—blonds—it’s very easy to get us mixed up. Literally they’re following this guy around the city and he looks like me from behind, and they go up to tap him on the shoulder and realize maybe it’s not him and call my cellphone, which they’ve now gotten through their records searches, and I pick up somewhere else entirely and hear a string of Russian curses. But on the other hand these are serious things, too, and not the sorts of intrusive tactics that should be thrown at journalists in this country, and one of these guys, Igor Ostrovskiy, and the source you mentioned, a sleeper, which is another saga in the book that plays out, leaks us documents in real time that prove that these people at this Israeli firm are lying to us, and they’re both people who believe in the free press and were dismayed to be part of this kind of operation, and that ultimately I hope makes this book a hopeful book and an optimistic one, because there’s plenty of darkness in it, but it ends on a note about the bravery of all these sources and whistleblowers who I think will keep coming in these dark times.
Going back to NBC: Is there any movement within the network or outside the network to do something? To have an independent investigation, the way other networks—you know, CBS had one after Les Moonves—have done when they’ve come up against a string of predators in their midst, and then covering it up as well?
Right, I mean when I broke those stories about CBS, there was a similar effort to dig in, to begin with, and a board that was protecting a group of executives accused of misconduct and of sleeping with underlings, very similar in a whole lot of respects—secret pattern of settlements and an initial effort to kind of smear me and the reporting. And then that did fall away thanks to an incisive, outside press that wasn’t tolerating the bullshit, and thanks to wonderful reporters within CBS saying “enough” and demanding answers. That gave way, as you say, to independent investigation and leadership change. In NBC’s case you have executives who are accused of serious misconduct and you have this pattern of cover-ups that have now been revealed. It’s the same kind of early phase where there’s an effort to dig in and an almost sort of Trumpian response of just the same talking points over and over. “There wasn’t a there there to the Weinstein reporting. It wasn’t worth putting on air,” which is somewhat besides the point and is not convincing anyone, so it’s a strange response, and there have been just unanimous calls from within that building for tough questions to be asked of this leadership, and people like Chris Hayes have gone on air and called out their bosses and said we should’ve broken that story, and I don’t know if any of you saw that Chris Hayes segment. It’s worth looking up. It’s a hard thing to do, to call out your bosses, and we’re seeing a lot of that.
Back to Harvey, I think one of the things that I realized as your reporting was first starting to come out two years ago, you and the Times, was that this whole generation of young actresses, we thought, “Oh, whatever happened to so-and-so? Well, it’s just the usual Hollywood bullshit where they reach 35 and they don’t get roles again until they’re 60.” But actually, so many of them were disappeared in one way or the other. And I wonder if, for even just Weinstein’s victims or a broader sense, do you think that we have seen most of the iceberg on that front?
Oh, I don’t think so at all. Certainly if you’re talking about the wider blacklisting and smearing of women who talk about these things, that persists, and it goes on every day. You know, people who speak truth to power are very quickly branded difficult, hysterical, emotional, are very quickly frozen out of work opportunities, and that happens in every industry. It’s especially ruthless in Hollywood, which is so ruthless about women and objectifying and commodifying women anyway. Thank god the women in these stories have spoken and the women who for the first time tell their stories in Catch and Kill have spoken. I hope it helps the culture, but that fight is just beginning. And it’s great to see people outside of and around those sources backing them up and talking about their role in whatever industry propping up those smearing and blacklisting efforts. Peter Jackson gave an interview saying like, “Yeah, I blacklisted Mira Sorvino and Ashely Judd. I didn’t really know that that’s what was happening, but Harvey Weinstein said they were difficult, so I took them out of the running for parts.” And that’s a small thing but really important. It’s really good that he did that, and that really takes guts, so props to Peter Jackson. Big Tolkien fan, so.
That reminds me that you asked me to discuss Wrinkle in Time.
Oh yeah we had a really deep conversation about Wrinkle in Time before this.
Are you Charles Wallace?
That’s so funny. I guess I did kind of identify with Charles Wallace. I think I wanted to be Calvin.
Yeah.
How am I doing? Am I becoming more like Calvin as I age? I hope.
You gotta start going to escape rooms with Jon. Then you’ll be a Calvin.
I feel like this audience is not—do we have Wrinkle in Time fans? Okay, yes. All right, we should just take a moment because that is such an important work of literature. I have not returned to it in recent years, but I did as probably a late teen, and I think it holds up. I think I might need to reread that, now, immediately. Also, the movie. Thoughts?
It had moments.
It did. It had moments.
So you wrote Catch and Kill…
That was a very diplomatic conversation about A Wrinkle in Time, the Walt Disney company film.
I love Ava DuVernay.
We love Ava DuVernay. She’s great. She’s fantastic and I liked many things that the movie earnestly tried to do.
Which brings me to maybe my final question, which is: You wrote Catch and Kill very cinematically. You’re moodily looking out into the ballet studio across the street. You’re constantly caught in rainstorms with the rivulets of water coming down your back. There’s actual cases where you and your assistant are, like, trying to evade people in the streets. It’s a good, rip-roaring read.
I believe that’s what’s known in the “save the cat” outline structure as the “fun and games” portion. Didn’t feel like fun and games at the time, but…
Uh, has it been optioned yet?
It has not, and I have taken some very exciting meetings with people I really respect creatively, but all while I was writing the thing and in a context where I felt the only answer could be, let’s talk in a few years because I have to do literally two years of incredibly hard investigative reporting before I even know how this story ends. But, yes, from very early on, I’m honored to say there was interest and just my focus has had to be on the reporting.
Okay, we’ll take that as your caveat. But who’s your dream director, living or dead, for this particular story, and who should play Ronan Farrow?
I can’t answer those questions because, Clara, if you really are invested in wanting to see a movie happen, then I can’t piss off the one director by naming the other director.
The dead directors.
The dead directors, well, the dead directors are really hard gets, as it turns out. Very, very difficult. Very hard to set up a film with Fellini these days.
It’s too bad. All right, so final-final question: Is Pundit in fact an angel?
There’s a chapter in Catch and Kill entitled “Pundit” in which Pundit plays a not inconsiderable…
I saw a few quizzical looks. Pundit is the dog that your mom gave to your now-fiancé, Jon Lovett. And Jon talks about her a lot.
She’s a goldendoodle, and the running reference to Pundit on the podcast is that Pundit is angel—and that does fact-check because Pundit actually has a moment of working with a source who’s reliving some pretty traumatic events, and leaping into her lap and comforting her when she’s upset.
And she’s crying about the horrible things she suffered from.
And Pundit is very alarmed. Dogs get alarmed when someone is upset. Pundit is very emotionally tuned in and was very upset by the interviews with sexual assault survivors. There’s a running theme of animals in this book, which is quite surprising. You kind of alluded to the cinematic nature of it. It was a challenge to get that balance on that right, and I’ve been so relieved that reviews have been embracing of that, because it was naturally embedded in the material. I spent months generating a bible, like the tick-tock of what happened every day, and the documents and communications from that day, so I had kind of the universe of what happened in real life.
Did the fact-checkers go in and say, “Actually Ronan, it was raining, you were right.”
Yeah, they did. Every reference to weather in here was of course fact-checked. But there were choices on a stylistic front. I had that bible of just the dry facts of what happened beat to beat, and that’s like 1,000 pages, and actually the very first draft of the book itself was also 1,000 pages. I’m not making that up. My poor editor. I’d gotten it down to 900 by the time she saw it, and then 700 by the time David Remnick saw it. Everyone suffered through long drafts of this book, but one of the stylistic tensions was, I made the choices about genre and prose style based on what I saw in the bible of real-life events. I realized there’s a running joke on these four occasions, and that’s a theme I can weave through. There’s X number of scenes taking place in rainstorms, and that’s pretty noirish, that feels like a Dashiell Hammett or a Raymond Chandler. And so the noir thriller vibe naturally bubbled up from the facts, but then there was still the question of, first and foremost, it had to be an airtight body of investigative reporting, and how much propulsive narrative and scene-setting stuff is a distraction? I really worked very hard to calibrate to the point where the narrative nature of the book is transporting and powerful in a way that enhances the reporting but doesn’t distract from it. So one of the things to fall on the cutting-room floor was actually more weather. There’s a scene that takes place during an eclipse. There’s sunsets. There’s rainstorms. But I think David Remnick was one of the people who was like, it’s so much rain. So there’s, I think, half the rain that there was in real life in this book.
I will say that Ronan Farrow moodily staring out into rainstorms is the new Bob Woodward anxiously looking through parking garages, so well done.
I will take that compliment, thank you.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The Kincade Fire alone threatens 90,000 structures. By Wednesday morning both fires were almost 20 percent contained, but severe winds could reverse progress firefighters have made. Meanwhile, almost a dozen other large fires are burning across the state.
Add to their many tragic consequences—the loss of life and property, the dislocation, the strain on resources—the fact that wildfires release large amounts of pollution into the atmosphere. A study published last week by the National Bureau of Economic Research from air pollution scientists at Carnegie Mellon University revealed that for the first time since 2009, air quality nationwide had plummeted, and nowhere fared worse than the west. Between 2016 and 2018, the levels of fine particulate matter—inhalable specks of liquids and solids that make up air pollution—increased by 11.5 percent. The result? Vulnerable people in these areas experience a greater number of heart attacks, strokes, and worsening of pulmonary conditions such as emphysema and asthma.
Researchers also found that the increase in air pollution since 2016 has caused almost 10,000 premature deaths across the country, with more than 40 percent of them in California alone. Karen Clay, an economics and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon and one of the study’s authors, speculates that the overall increase in California’s air pollution comes from myriad sources, including increased economic activity and a decline in EPA regulation enforcement. Wildfires are one important factor in the uptick, but, she says, their specific impact is difficult to measure with any accuracy.
One way to do so, though, is look at health data of people who have been exposed to those fires. According to Dr. Nicholas Kenyon, a professor and pulmonologist at UC Davis, the school’s Environmental Health Sciences Center has been conducting surveys of Californians in areas affected by wildfires. The research hasn’t been published yet, but the numbers he’s seen are troubling —especially when it comes to preexisting conditions like asthma.
“Fifty percent of them had worsening asthma symptoms,” he says. “These were folks who were from a few miles to many miles away [from fire events].”
The mortality rates specifically linked to air pollution can be difficult to measure, but a particularly dramatic event, a wildfire for instance, that occurs during a restricted time period could provide useful data. While analyzing stats on air pollution rates and resulting deaths, Clay and her colleagues decided to isolate specific months to spot trends. When findings from November 2018, the month of California’s Camp and Woolsey fires, were separated from the data overall, they found that over a thousand people died from air pollution-related ailments, in comparison to the previous months when the average mortality rate was a fraction of that. After eliminating all other possible factors, the researchers concluded the fires were the only variable that could explain the upturn.
“To cause that kind of effect,” Clay says, “some polluter would suddenly take off their emission controls, but only in November of 2018.”
Officially, 88 deaths have been attributed to the Camp and Woolsey fires, but these were the people who were directly in harm’s way. But then researchers examined the effects of the pollution the fires released into the atmosphere, and found that it lead to the premature deaths of up to 1400 more people. This does not include how the pollution has affected countless others whose preexisting conditions were intensified by the bad air.
“There’s a huge quality of life component for people who didn’t die,” she says. “The kid down the block who gets asthma and has another asthma attack because the air quality is really bad. The person who has to be on oxygen because of air quality issues.”
Researchers noticed that during the Camp Fire, many who suffer from respiratory ailments made more trips to the pharmacy rather than the hospital. Andrew Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at UC Davis, said that the 2018 wildfires, which burned about 250,000 acres and displaced almost 300,000 people, caused “probably the worst air pollution in the world at the time,” but didn’t lead to an increase in ER visits to UC Davis Medical Center.
“People who have some preexisting condition,” Wexler says. “Those people are very much susceptible to this kind of stuff, and it could push them over the edge. Albuterol use went up. People who have asthma used more inhalants in order to get past this terrible wildfire smoke.”
And not all wildfire smoke is equal. In 2018, the same year of the Camp and Woosley fires, the Mendocino Fire burned more than 450,000 acres of national forest land and was the biggest fire in California history. But the effects of this fire’s pollution weren’t visible in the mortality rates of the Carnegie Mellon study. Wexler suggests that the worst fires aren’t the biggest ones, but the ones that burn closest to people—and their man-made materials.
“Houses have terrible chemicals in the construction materials and whatever they got lying around,” Wexler says. “That stuff probably is much worse for you than regular old wildfire smoke.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

It’s a Sign of a Bigger Crisis That the State Tried to Downplay.,Samantha Michaels,MotherJones,Prisons,"In July 2018, Dr. Michael Golding, the chief psychiatrist for California’s correctional department, visited a maximum-security prison near Sacramento to shadow a couple of psychiatrists there. At least three-quarters of their scheduled patients missed their morning appointments. That afternoon, he and one of the psychiatrists went to a cell block, trying to find the no-shows among a huddle of towel-clad inmates returning from the shower, to talk at least for a minute or two with people struggling with issues like manic episodes and suicidal thoughts.
To Golding, it was a sign the system wasn’t working properly. How could you treat someone in a crowd of other inmates, without any privacy or substantive time to talk? But a week later, prison officials burst into applause during a meeting after discussing the facility’s mental health care: state data suggested 90 percent of the prison’s patients were being seen at their scheduled appointments, even though only about a quarter of patients had made it to their appointments during Golding’s visit. He recounted this in recent court documents, arguing the data was misleading: For one, the department considered an appointment completed on time even if it consisted of two nonconfidential minutes chatting with a doctor in the hallway after a shower or in the yard surrounded by other people.
Last week, based on Golding’s whistleblower testimony about medical care in correctional facilities, a federal judge ruled that the California corrections department knowingly gave a court misleading data that covered up or downplayed the extent of a continuing mental health crisis in its prisons.
“A system in which a large majority of patients are not getting psychiatric care when scheduled or otherwise when they need it, and which is not set up in such a way that patients are brought to psychiatry appointments in confidential offices, but in which instead, the psychiatrist is expected to search the prison yard looking for patients or trying to communicate through a crack in the cell door and unable to look at the patient while speaking loudly to be heard through the crack in the door, is by no means conducive to good patient care,” Golding wrote in a 161-page report to the court last year. “It might not be surprising to find high rates of hospitalization and suicide in such a poorly designed and run system.”
The judge’s ruling is part of a decades-long class-action lawsuit by inmates seeking better medical care. In 1995, a court ordered the state to provide better access to psychiatrists and mental health appointments in prisons, saying the quality of care was so poor it put people at risk of serious death and injury. Since then, the state has been required to check in with the court about its progress, in a system where more than a third of inmates receive treatment for mental illness. In 2011, the Supreme Court famously ordered California to downsize its prison population because overcrowding made it impossible to give them adequate care. But in recent years, the state presented data to the court that showed improvement. In 2018, the corrections department claimed 94 percent of appointments across its prisons were completed in a “timely” way, according to Golding’s report. He contends fewer than half of inmates were actually seen at their scheduled appointments.
According to a transcript released Wednesday, US District Judge Kimberly Mueller found Golding’s report extremely compelling. “Misleading information was provided to the Court, make no mistake,” Mueller said in a hearing on October 23. She added that while she saw no evidence the state committed intentional fraud, which would involve a scheme to hide a key fact from the court, there was, “at minimum….willful blindness or reckless indifference, given the context in which the decision was made.” The choice to make the data seem better, she added, was “misguided and a symptom of an approach marked by a quick, really unthinking fix and applying a very tiny bandage to a festering wound while the infection spreads throughout the body.”
The corrections department, according to Golding’s testimony, considered an appointment completed if a psychologist or psychiatrist met with a patient for a minute or two in the yard or at his cell, speaking through a slit in a solid metal door, or surrounded by other inmates and custodial officers. It also counted telepsychiatry visits, which sometimes allegedly consisted of a laptop being placed outside a cell door so that the patient could speak with a therapist onscreen, but still with no privacy. According to Golding, the data system defaulted to recording appointments as confidential, and many medical staffers said they didn’t know how to change that classification: At one crisis bed facility, all appointments in May 2018 were recorded as occurring in private spaces, but psychiatrists on the ground said that almost none of them did, except for the one time that month when a court-appointment monitor was present. “These are not adequate medical appointments,” Golding wrote.
What’s more, he said, though the court ordered that certain patients should be seen every 30 days, the corrections department in 2016 began to count appointments as compliant if they occurred within 45 days. (The next year it stopped doing this after Golding objected.) Making matters worse, officials would reset the clock every time a person transferred to a new prison, meaning he or she could go much longer before an appointment and it would still be considered on time. Golding added that department psychologists, who are not medical doctors, wore badges identifying themselves as such and made medical decisions like discharging patients and ordering restraints without consulting with psychiatric physicians.
The consequences for patients can be dire. In 2017, a woman in a Chino prison cell ripped out her eye and ate it during a psychotic episode after having screaming fits for four hours. Earlier that day she was evaluated by a psychologist, who could not give her medication. Even during the screaming fits, the psychologist did not call a psychiatrist, who could have prescribed medication—one allegedly wasn’t called until later, after the eye had been eaten, according to Golding’s report. “The tragedy is that any competent psychiatric physician or general medical physician would have medicated the patient, and likely the patient’s eye would still be in her head had that happened,” Golding wrote.
California’s inmate suicide rate is one of the worst among the country’s largest prison systems, and it has risen steadily for the past four years—from 19 suicides per 100,000 inmates in 2015, to 26 suicides per 100,000 inmates in 2018, according to an investigation by the San Francisco Chronicle. From 2001 to 2014, the number of suicides in California prisons was double the number in the entire federal system, even though there are more federal inmates.
Before Golding first complained to the court last year, the state corrections department had argued that it didn’t need to hire more psychiatrists because conditions had improved even with the vacancies. Recruiting mental health staffers is a challenge for prisons across the country, as the Marshall Project reported, and California is experiencing a shortage of psychiatrists across the state, according to data cited by the governor’s office. “In a system that is failing to get more than 50% of patients to their appointments, many more psychiatrists are needed than would be otherwise, because of the wasted time, the enormous work needed to try to find patients who did not come,” Golding wrote.
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation “appreciates the court’s attention to these important issues and remains committed to providing appropriate and constitutional mental health care and services to all in its custody,” a spokesperson for the department told Mother Jones. “The department is making a number of improvements to its systems to ensure that all of our data is accurate and reliable.”
Judge Mueller asked attorneys for California inmates to submit recommendations for what changes should be made going forward and noted that the state had already filed some corrections to fix the record of certain misleading information. She urged both sides to remember the goal they’ve been working toward since 1995, to provide people struggling with mental illness with the “absolute, undeniable right to adequate treatment.”
“This Court,” she added, “is called upon to make clear what should be patently obvious, and that is that remediation may not be accomplished by end runs and hiding the ball to create a false picture to the Court.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The new decree by Jim Spanfeller, the journalistically illiterate and widely despised CEO of G/O Media, is of course anti-Deadspin and anti-reader; it’s also antithetical to journalism in general and to the basic, necessary work of saying true things about a world that doesn’t fit neatly into the categories advertisers like to sell against. But it’s more than that. “Stick to” is shorthand for something more sinister, a whole system of control whose stay-in-your-lane logic is so easily exported to other areas of culture. Publishers and promoters told Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln to stick to jazz (never mind your quaintly political, off-topic We Insist! Freedom Now Suite in 1960); LeRoi Jones to stick to poems, plays, and corner-store protests, and stick his Blues People: Negro Music in White America polemic up his ass in 1963; Nat Hentoff to stick to jazz or the Constitution and never to connect their dots.
A day after Spanfeller fired a Deadspin editor, Barry Petchesky, for not sticking to sports, leading nearly the entire staff to quit in solidarity, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni argued in his newsletter that the fans who’d booed Trump at the World Series should have stuck to sports. In his Times newsletter subject-lined “I didn’t like hearing Trump booed,” the very liberal-minded Bruni, a career neutralist who like a lot of establishment journalists seems to hold neutrality as the highest possible virtue, criticized Trump for “demeaning people” as well as “fans at the stadium” whose boos “demeaned him in turn.” Trump may be trashing “norms” and “etiquette,” but fans who booed Trump were “likewise” stooping to sneers beyond sports. All a wash. “I couldn’t take any joy in it,” Bruni adjudicated, not realizing that boos are not a joy to take; they’re a message. Etiquette is not at stake; expression is.
There’s a convergence of confusions here—a confusion of decorum for dignity; of neutrality for earned judgment. Not all boos are created equal. Deadspin’s owner and the Times’ Bruni are arguing from the same pious, false premise that there are things above (or beneath) politics, as if politics don’t shape the very structure of sports, of jazz, as if politics don’t lie at the root of a boss’s wish to control employees’ expression.
“We’re surrendering restraint,” Bruni warned in a 2017 op-ed about all sides of public life, bemoaning the coarsening of American politics. A telling choice of words, and a telling absence, too. Restraint from what, he doesn’t say. The restraint itself is his point. That’s what the “stick to” mandates are all about—not journalism, not even profits, but control for its own sake.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Steve Beshear, a Democrat, issued an executive order automatically restoring voting rights for roughly 140,000 people with past felony convictions who had completed their sentences for nonviolent crimes. Republican Matt Bevin, who supported restoring voting rights for ex-offenders while serving in the Kentucky senate, changed his mind after replacing Beshear as governor in December 2015 and rescinded his predecessor’s executive order. As a result, more than 300,000 people with felony convictions can’t vote in Kentucky—9 percent of the population, according to a 2016 study by the Sentencing Project, including more than one in four African Americans, making it the state with the highest black disenfranchisement rate.
Now Beshear’s son Andy, the state attorney general, is running against Bevin for governor in Tuesday’s election and promising to reinstate his father’s executive order. “Matt Bevin’s unnecessary voting restrictions make it harder for Kentuckians to be involved in our democratic process,” Beshear told the Louisville Courier Journal. “Unlike this governor, I want to lift up all of our families and believe we have a moral responsibility to protect and expand the right to vote.”
The Kentucky governor’s contest is one of a handful of state races on Tuesday that could have a major impact on voting rights by expanding access to the ballot or replacing gerrymandered maps drawn by Republicans.
Democrats have a shot to win governor’s races in three deep-red states this month. Polls show surprisingly close races in Tuesday’s elections in Kentucky and Mississippi, as well as the Louisiana contest on November 16. Democratic victories in any of these races would give the new governors the ability to veto redistricting maps that will be passed by the GOP-controlled state legislatures in those states in 2021, when states across the country draw new maps based on the 2020 census.
Democrats are also only a few seats away from reclaiming the state legislature in Virginia on Tuesday, which would give them control of a key battleground state for the first time in a quarter of a century. (The governor is a Democrat.) Virginia Democrats could pass new redistricting maps for the state legislative and congressional districts to replace the gerrymandered ones enacted by Republicans in the House of Delegates. A federal court struck down 11 state house districts in June 2018, finding that they were illegal racial gerrymanders, and a court-appointed expert redrew those districts to make them fairer. If Democrats take the majority, they could replace the entire statewide map—a move that could create a more representative legislature or that could turn a GOP-biased map into a Democratic-friendly one.
Another possibility: A Democratic majority in the state legislature could establish a bipartisan commission to redraw the state’s legislative and congressional maps, making Virginia the second-largest state after California to enact redistricting reform. Earlier this year, the GOP-led legislature approved a constitutional amendment to create an independent commission, but it must be approved by the legislature again next year and then by voters in a referendum to become law.
Democrats in Virginia could also enact a wide array of proposals for expanding access to the ballot. Virginia has some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country: It requires government-issued photo ID to vote; voters must have an excuse for why they won’t be present on Election Day in order to vote early or obtain an absentee ballot; and the governor can restore voting rights for people with past felony convictions only on a case-by-case basis. If Democrats win control of the state legislature, they could repeal the voter ID law and pass reforms including automatic restoration of voting rights for ex-offenders, no-excuse early and absentee voting, Election Day registration, and automatic registration—joining a nationwide trend of Democrats in blue states aggressively expanding the right to vote. These bills have already been introduced by Democrats in the legislature, but Republicans have blocked the initiatives.
The state races in 2019 have huge stakes for the future of democracy, even though they have been overshadowed by the impeachment inquiry and the 2020 presidential election. “The presidential election is of existential importance, but these state races are, if not existential in their importance, more important than any state races have perhaps ever been,” former Attorney General Eric Holder, who’s leading a group seeking to reverse Republican gerrymandering efforts, said at an event organized by Mother Jones last month. “I can’t imagine what this country will look like if we have 20 years of gerrymandered Republican control and we try to dislodge it in 2031 instead of 2021.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

What Could Go Wrong?,AJ Vicens,MotherJones,Politics,"The phones of senior government and military officials in multiple US-allied countries were targeted with a hacking tool via WhatsApp, a popular encrypted messaging application, according to a new Reuters report. Multiple Trump administration officials are known to have used WhatsApp to carry out sensitive conversations, raising the prospect that their communications have been intercepted.
The report, by Reuters’ Chris Bing and Raphael Satter, comes in the wake of a lawsuit filed by WhatsApp and its parent company, Facebook, against NSO Group, an Israeli technology firm that specializes in developing tools that allow governments to hack and collect intelligence. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in a California federal court, alleges that the firm used WhatsApp servers and technology to target roughly 1,400 users between January 2018 and May 2019, including human rights activists, journalists, and politicians. WhatsApp released a fix for the vulnerability in May, addressing a flaw that allowed attackers to surreptitiously access a victim’s text messages, contacts, emails, and other sensitive information. NSO Group denies the accusation, and says it will “vigorously fight them.”
In March, the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, revealed that Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and one of his most trusted associates, was using WhatsApp to “communicate with foreign leaders.” Kushner has had extensive dealings with political figures throughout the middle east. Gordon Sondland, Trump’s ambassador to the European Union and a key figure in in the administration’s campaign to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations that would benefit the president, communicated with other US diplomats about the effort over WhatsApp. During Trump’s run for the presidency campaign chairman Paul Manafort regularly sent polling data to a Russian associate via the app.
“I have zero doubt that over time at least some of Kushner’s communications were swept up,” says Jake Williams, the founder of Rendition Infosec and a former NSA hacker. “It’s important to consider that even if Kushner wasn’t a direct target, he could have been targeted indirectly by compromising those he communicates with.”
The growing revelations about the WhatsApp vulnerability come after a number of prominent cybersecurity missteps from the president’s team. Last week, Axios reported on an October resignation letter from Dimitrios Vastakis, a White House computer security official, warning that the building’s systems were vulnerable to intrusion after a series of management changes and personnel departures. A year ago, the New York Times reported that Trump was still using an insecure iPhone to talk with friends and associates. And just today, NBC News revealed that Rudy Giuliani, one of the president’s private attorneys and a likely target of every capable intelligence agency, took his personal iPhone into an Apple store in San Francisco in 2017 after he’d locked himself out of it; the article revealed that a copy of his phone’s data was stored on a cloud server.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Katie Hill (D-Calif.) took responsibility for mistakes she had made that helped end her brief career in Congress. But she also denounced the “misogynistic culture” that pushed her out of office while preserving Donald Trump’s presidency.
In recent days, conservative publications have posted nude photos of Hill, which she said were taken without her knowledge. Hill has suggested that the photos were released by her estranged husband, Kenny Heslep, who she says was abusive. (Heslep’s father has said that Heslep denies leaking the photos.) Hill announced her resignation Sunday amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into whether she had an affair with a congressional staffer, an allegation she has denied. She has also acknowledged a consensual but “inappropriate” relationship with a campaign staffer. After apologizing to her supporters Thursday, Hill took aim the media outlets that published the photos.
“I’m leaving because of a misogynistic culture that gleefully consumed my naked pictures, capitalized on my sexuality, and enabled my abusive ex to continue that abuse, this time with the entire country watching,” Hill said. “Today is the first time I’ve left my apartment since the photos—taken without my consent—were released. And I’m scared.”

Hill noted that, earlier in the day, she cast her final vote—to formalize the ongoing impeachment investigation—”on behalf of the women of the United States.”
“The forces of revenge by a bitter, jealous man; cyber-exploitation and sexual shaming that target our gender; and a large segment of society that fears and hates powerful women, have combined to push a young woman out of power,” she said. “Yet a man who brags about his sexual predation, who’s had dozens of women come forward to accuse him of sexual assault, who pushes policies that are uniquely harmful to women, and who has filled the courts with judges who proudly rule to deprive women have the most fundamental rights to control their own bodies, sits in the highest office of the land.”

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) has securely established himself as one the biggest Republican trolls in Congress. He loves nothing more than taunting his Democratic colleagues and questioning their patriotism. He recently called Democrats working on impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump “an angry pack of rabid hyenas” and led his GOP colleagues to storm the deposition of an impeachment witness in the Capitol’s sensitive information facility. So why, then, has he become an outspoken defender of Rep. Katie Hill, a Democrat from California?
Hill, who until recently was one of the party’s rising stars, recently announced her resignation following revelations that she had a three-way affair with a campaign staffer and her now-estranged husband. Congress had launched an ethics investigation into allegations that she also had an affair with one of her congressional aides. (Hill, who is openly bisexual, has admitted the affair with the campaign staffer, but denied the relationship with her House aide.) Hill’s private life became headline news after the British tabloid the Daily Mail and conservative website RedState published nude photos of her without her consent. She has suggested that the photos were leaked by “an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me.” Her husband has denied leaking the photos.
Not many of Hill’s Democratic colleagues have stepped forward with full-throated defenses of the 32-year-old member of Congress. But Gaetz did. Last week, as the allegations were unfolding, he tweeted: “Who among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text? Katie isn’t being investigated by Ethics or maligned because she hurt anyone—it is because she is different.” Later he tweeted: “Congress should write a budget before we play ‘bedroom police’ or allow an ex to illegally humiliate our colleague for being different. Key fact: Not a whiff of a complaint from anyone who has worked for Congresswoman Hill. Just an angry ex releasing revenge porn. Sad!”
Gaetz’s tweets were notable for their empathy, something that rarely shows up in his regular Fox News appearances, where he serves as an attack-dog surrogate for the Trump administration, frequently lashing out at Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, and calling him a “pencil neck.” Many in Gaetz’s party have made attacking LGBTQ people part of their platform, and other GOP members of Congress rushed to call on Hill to resign.
So what gives? I wrote a long profile of Gaetz earlier this year and spent months reporting on him and interviewing people in his district. I have a couple of ideas.
First, Gaetz, 37, is a millennial like Hill. He was an early adopter of Twitter and is deeply immersed in social media and Instagram selfie culture. He understands all too well that lots of young people may have a photo trail they would rather not see made public. As I wrote in the spring:
But I suspect Gaetz’s motivation for defending Hill may run deeper than his own dating life. He seems genuinely committed to the idea that his party needs to move into the 21st century and abandon its attacks on LGBTQ people. Back in 2015, when Gaetz was still a member of the Florida House, the state legislature was considering a bill that would roll back a decades-old law banning same-sex couples from adopting children. Republicans tried to add a rider to the bill that would have allowed private agencies to invoke religious freedom as an excuse to continue to discriminate against gay couples. Gaetz’s father, Don Gaetz, was then the state Senate president. He helped defeat the religious freedom provision and roll back what he referred to as the “archaic, dusty, dead law.”
A staunch religious conservative and acolyte of former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Don Gaetz had never been a champion of LGBTQ rights. But he credited his progressive stance on the adoption bill to an influential adviser: his son, Matt. “My son sat me down and said, ‘Dad, nobody under 35 cares about this issue. Only you old guys…Republicans shouldn’t care,’” Don Gaetz told a group of Florida State University students in 2015.
Earlier this year, the Florida legislature took up another bill that would outlaw workplace discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. Social conservatives were outraged and attacked the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Joe Gruters, who is also chair of the Florida GOP. Matt Gaetz came to his defense, saying, “People don’t choose to be gay, and we shouldn’t be mean to people based on who they are.”
Last year, Gaetz told The Hill that the GOP needed to move away from attacking gay people if it wanted to attract younger voters. “I think we need to make it very clear that we don’t hate gay people,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that we want to deconstruct the concept of the American family, I think we need to support the family as the principal institution of American life. But for people who don’t fit neatly into that, you know, ‘Leave it to Beaver’ mentality, there needs to be broader acceptance in our party.”
Gaetz doesn’t always live up to his own standards. In April, he made a few headlines during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Equality Act, a bill that would ban discrimination against LGBTQ people. Gaetz insisted that he would have liked to support the bill because he’s opposed to discrimination against transgender people, but he couldn’t bring himself to vote aye because he believed the bill would allow “bad actors” to somehow “weaponize” it to their advantage. To illustrate his point, he said, “Consider this possibility: If President Trump were to say, ‘I am now the first female president,’ who would celebrate that? Would those who support the legislation think that’s a good thing or would they be dismayed?”
There’s another reason Gaetz may have some sympathy for Hill, with whom he has served on the Armed Services Committee. He has said repeatedly that he is straight, but he has been the target of anti-gay vitriol himself. Rumors about his sexuality have been promoted by some of his political opponents and a discredited conspiracy theory website. The lawmaker has been chill about this, once tweeting: “while I have nothing against gay folks, that ain’t me.” It’s hard to imagine that Gaetz has been entirely unaffected by the attacks. He could be the rare straight man who knows what it’s like to encounter anti-gay bigotry firsthand, an experience that might affect how he views Katie Hill.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

He was still on the plane when, he told the Guardian, “I called [my agent] back and she said, ‘Oprah.’ I said, ‘Shut the front door,’ because I didn’t want to curse. She said, ‘Oprah book club.’ I said, ‘Motherfucker.’”
Whitehead’s sixth novel, The Underground Railroad, getting chosen by Oprah was a door opening, or really more one blasting open—and Whitehead clearly knew it. Oprah’s stamp of approval on your book can make your career, massively boost your book sales, and get your book into the mainstream like really nothing else can, even a Nobel Prize. I mean, look at Toni Morrison. While I want to be clear that she is a literary genius whose impact was immense long before she got popular attention, consider that when Morrison’s debut novel, The Bluest Eye, was first published in 1970, it sold just 2,000 copies, according to Quartz. After being featured as an Oprah’s Book Club pick in 2000, it sold 800,000 copies.
I was in middle school on September 17, 1996, when Oprah Winfrey stood in front of a studio audience in Chicago and announced she was starting the book club. But even though I didn’t consider myself—a basketball-loving tomboy growing up in San Francisco—part of her target demographic, I couldn’t escape her reach back then, and still now. This book club, through several evolutions and iterations, is the only part of the sprawling Oprah empire I genuinely care about. Her book club, for me—and I suspect a lot of other people, particularly in my age bracket—is the most culturally resonant part of her powerful legacy. I didn’t watch her talk show, am grumpily and somewhat naturally predisposed to be skeptical of her enthusiasm for All The Things, and despite my being a Leo and an only child, still can’t quite fathom putting my own face on the cover of a magazine every month for two decades.
But it would be treasonous to book nerds everywhere not to acknowledge the outsize impact Oprah’s had on publishing. And me. If one of the Oprah seals of approval catches my eye at the bookstore, I can’t help but stop. And with the club relaunching this month on Apple TV Plus, it’ll reach a whole new generation of people who I hope will get the same excitement finding the little orange O on a cover’s corner.
This is not just about the woman having good taste. This is about how Oprah, Patron Saint of Palatability, tells her millions of viewers not just that they should read, but what they should read. And, critically, those picks are often black writers who make race and America’s torrid racial history the center of their work. Of the 81 books Oprah has chosen since 1996, almost 30 are by authors of color. That’s not a bad track record—and the frequency of those picks has only increased in more recent years. She’s made black literature popular literature, from Morrison’s Paradise to Whitehead’s Underground Railroad to Imbolo Mbue’s Behold the Dreamers. (Though this power can also boost people like Bill Cosby, who had three books on the list, and James Frey and his disgraced memoir, I’d argue it’s mostly been used for good.) She made what were largely taboo issues part of the pop culture conversation. She has the power to alter a reader’s perspective—on issues like reparations, slavery, and incarceration.
“It’s been so wonderful to see her use [her] platform to say, ‘I am invested in the stories that African Americans have to tell. And I believe that these stories are universally compelling,'” says Lisa Lucas, executive director of the National Book Foundation, which hosts the prestigious National Book Awards. “I think that has helped change the reception of stories that might’ve been marginalized otherwise.”
For writers like Nicole Dennis-Benn, praise from Oprah is also validation of their own work. “Of course [my] stories are told through Jamaican, working class women. They tackle universal themes like immigration, motherhood, belonging, acceptance, sexuality, colorism, classism, all those things,” she says of her two books, Patsy and Here Comes the Sun, which were both top picks in O, the Oprah Magazine. “I am so happy though that people are now seeing our stories and getting to kind of empathize with people who definitely look different from them or someone different from them.”
She adds, “I’m putting these untold stories out there, because as a girl growing up, these stories were kind of hush-hush, they were gossip. But to have our stories out there as working-class Jamaican women, people seeing us and hearing our voices, it means a lot to me.”
Back in ’96, when Oprah wanted to indulge with the world in her favorite pastime, it probably seemed like just that: an indulgence. “I wanna get the whole country reading again!” she beamed, as the camera panned to an audience of hopeful-looking women, most of them looking eager, blond, white.

But this in and of itself was an important image: A black woman born into poverty in Mississippi was just about singlehandedly dictating the tastes of a key, moneyed demographic of white women, who happened to influence white households and their buying practices, and also drive mass culture.
Sure, you could say Oprah wasn’t the first black woman to do such a thing. America’s cultural landscape is littered with the penniless carcasses of black women who shaped film and music in their day, from Billie Holiday to Josephine Baker. But Oprah represented something altogether different. She didn’t make culture so much as she anointed it. As America’s ultimate tastemaker, she was an influencer before there were influencers, as Lucas puts it to me. And unlike her predecessors, Oprah was actually acknowledged and compensated—beyond even her wildest imagination—for that work.
Crucially, so were the people she deemed worthy.
In an interview with Vibe in 1998, Morrison explained that Oprah was making books part of the public discourse in a way that had never quite happened before. “Most book shows on television miss the point because they’re teacherly, I-know-it-you-don’t, elitist,” Morrison said. “It’s not open, friendly, we’re both in this together. And it’s off-putting for the non-reader, non-browser, non-academic person.” Importantly, she added, “The bestseller sells to people who don’t buy books.”
Oprah brought Morrison to the fore of America’s popular masses in a way that the writer’s greatest literary achievement—the 1993 Nobel Prize for Literature—simply did not. Morrison was a black woman who wrote about black womanhood from all manner of lived experience, from pliable girlhood (The Bluest Eye) to defiant motherhood (Beloved). Eventually, four of Morrison’s titles made Oprah’s list—more than any other author. But most importantly, Oprah used her platform to publicize Morrison, offering viewers an intimate look at a decorated female author’s path as a working mother who hadn’t started writing seriously until her 30s. This was probably Oprah’s greatest genius: her ability to make extraordinary people seem ordinary, and to make other people relate to them and thus connect with them. Morrison was brilliant, yes. But she was also tired, overburdened by her obligations to other people, and still learning to prioritize her own desires, as she describes in 1996 at Oprah’s dinner table:

Now Oprah is extending this tradition in the third iteration of her book club. To kick off the partnership with Apple, which officially begins November 1, Oprah chose one of the most anticipated books in years: Ta-Nehisi Coates’ debut novel, The Water Dancer, which follows a man born into American slavery who discovers a miraculous superpower. “I have not felt this way about a book since Beloved,” Oprah has gushed in interviews.
Last year, when it was announced that Oprah had signed a deal with Apple for undisclosed gobs of money, it would have been easy to write the whole thing off as another mogul teaming up with a tech giant to do evil. In a society where everyone is polarized and everything is problematic, the term “influencer” is barreling toward the phrases “billionaire” and “techie” as pejoratives.
“I can do whatever I want,” Oprah bragged to Ellen DeGeneres recently, before noting that she’ll dabble in documentaries and occasional interviews. Oprah’s Book Club will be “in a billion pockets, y’all,” as she told Ellen—meaning her picks will be given prime real estate in the iBook store, and her interviews with authors will likely live on pre-installed iOS software in the Apple TV Plus app on your iPhone. There’s also a standalone Oprah’s Book Club app in development and broad yet vague plans to create an engaged community on Instagram, and even a hashtag: #ReadWithUs.
This new iteration of the book club will be more consistent with six picks per year, while in past years there was no real timetable. And it will somewhat formalize what previously felt like a coincidence, by more sharply focusing the conversation on race and once-forbidden issues. “One of the hopes in this iteration of the book club for Oprah is that many of the books that she picked will be novels or memoirs [that] can start conversations around urgent relevant topics,” says Leigh Haber, books editor for O, the Oprah Magazine and coordinator of Oprah’s Book Club. “I think Oprah is drawn to stories of people who are underserved, and [Oprah’s Book Club] will primarily focus on books with relevant social themes.”
Like Morrison was when she was picked by Oprah, Coates is of course already incredibly successful: A heralded essayist with three works of nonfiction under his belt, his fame is such that he’s now casually mentioned by other artists like Chance the Rapper and Black Thought in songs. His latest book was likely to break through, though it was not assured. But Oprah’s blessing seems to have guaranteed that it shot up the New York Times bestseller list before the book’s official release in September. And she’s boosted the book alongside Coates on the morning talk show circuit—where the masses were finally introduced to Coates, the person.
“The idea with The Water Dancer by Ta-Nehisi Coates [is] to engage in conversation around reparations, around the legacy of slavery. Even around something like when you refer to an enslaved person as a slave, it robs them of their identity,” Haber says. “And I think the books, and the authors, give Oprah the opportunity to engage deeply in conversation about topics that are very, very important to her and to the rest of us. That’s the goal.”
For Coates’ part, he told his hometown paper, the Baltimore Sun, “I was just as surprised as anybody” to be chosen. But he was delighted by the conversation that followed. “I was really happy…But I think the most encouraging part was that she’s a reader. It was clear from the conversation that she’s a reader. This is not a marketing ploy. There’s nothing to be cynical about.”
To come back again to Morrison, Oprah popularized what was once the domain of the elite, so it’s no surprise there are scores of other book clubs that have popped up in its image. There are a slew of other celebrity ones—hi, Reese Witherspoon—and there are even a few that have devoted themselves to the still radical act of black women who read. Well-Read Black Girl, for instance, is a mostly online reading community created by Glory Edim. It now has a community of more than 50,000 followers on Twitter, and the club brings together readers and black women literary stars like Jacqueline Woodson and Nic Stone at an annual festival. Edim tells me she started reading books along with Oprah back in high school.
“Well-Read Black Girl would not exist without her life and legacy,” Edim tells me. To underscore that point, Edim giddily recounts meeting Oprah at a recent invite-only launch event for The Water Dancer in New York City. In a video of their encounter, Oprah holds a copy of Edim’s recently published anthology of writings by authors featured by the book club. “Well-Read Black Girl, that’s what I am already,” Oprah says to the camera.
After some prodding by Edim, Oprah stresses the point further: “I am the original,” she laughs.

I too am in a book club. For the past decade or so, a group of three friends and I have met once every few months on Google Hangout to talk about books on a Friday night. It’s been one of the most consistent joys in my life, if for no other reason than I get to use books to connect with people who I’d otherwise probably lose touch with. And, like Edim, this joy began with Oprah. In high school, when I sought solace in an Oprah-approved Wally Lamb, who in different circumstances I would not have gotten to know, I felt seen as the emo teen I was, and one who was starting to sift through a complicated family history. More recently, after Oprah picked Tayari Jones’ An American Marriage, I went down the rabbit hole of Jones’ three previous novels, which reinforced the idea that reading can be a solitary act that’s part of a collective rebellion.
Oprah is a celebrity who has been famous since before I was born. But she’s also a black woman whose most influential gift to the world has been her discerning taste as a reader. That’s no small thing in a country that once forbade black people from learning how to read and write. That’s no small thing to a girl like me, a black girl, who loves to read.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The real problem is carbon emissions in places like China and India, which are growing faster than ours and, in China’s case, already much higher.
The motivation for this attitude is obvious: conservatives don’t want to address climate change, and this is a good excuse for doing nothing. But motivation aside, do they have a point?
The International Energy Agency recently released a series of reports about energy use in southeast Asia. Here is the penetration rate of air conditioners over the past two decades:
Air conditioner penetration has tripled and refrigerator penetration has nearly doubled. Here is the IEA’s projection for the next two decades:
As the usual aphorism goes, “They all want air conditioners too.” (And cars and refrigerators and so forth.) This might not be too bad if all these air conditioners were going to be powered by solar panels, but that’s not where the investment is:
The end result is this:
Energy use is projected to increase by half and fossil fuel use is projected to rise by 60 percent. If nothing happens to change this, it will dwarf any reduction in carbon emissions from the developed countries of the West.
And this is only southeast Asia, which doesn’t include India or China. It’s at most #3 in the fossil fuel race.
In other words, American conservatives have a point. Their motives may be suspect, but that doesn’t mean they’re wrong. The Green New Deal is all well and good, but the real challenge for climate change hawks is the skyrocketing growth of fossil fuels in the developing world. That should be the single biggest focus of our attention. Everything else is a nit by comparison.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

It’s an odd demand considering many people did, in fact, read the White House’s reconstruction of his now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and it was widely viewed as highly damaging for the president. The document also featured several curious ellipses, which a top Ukraine expert with firsthand knowledge of the conversation told investigators this week marked the omission of key details related to Trump’s demands for an investigation into his political enemies. According to the New York Times, that revelation didn’t “fundamentally change lawmakers’ understanding of the call,” but it does further undermine Trump’s insistence that the document somehow exonerates him.
Still, “read the transcript” has emerged as Trump’s go-to, shorthand defense, a kind of catchall rejoinder against impeachment. Now, with allegations of multiple quid pro quos piling up, “read the transcript” appears ready for primetime. Trump told the Washington Examiner on Thursday:

The animals have brought Poncia acclaim: Stemple Creek’s organic meats fetch top dollar at nearby markets and at restaurants as revered as Berkeley’s Chez Panisse. But these days, Poncia’s attention has turned to some different critters. They number in the billions, and they live underground: soil microbes.
Poncia uses a technique with his cattle known as managed rotational grazing. The herd munches on a piece of pasture for a set period of time. Then, with the prodding of some electric fences, they move to another patch of grass so the last patch can recover and regrow. “We try and mimic what mother nature did in the great plains,” Poncia says, “where there was huge herds of bison that would migrate across the great plains and they’d eat the grass in front of them, stomp on the grass below ‘em and poop on the grass behind ‘em, and it would really regenerate the soil every year and make a really good ecosystem for perennial plants.”
The grasslands suck up carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis. And the more life the soil contains, the more it can help break down that CO2 and store it as carbon, deep underground. By practicing a type of agriculture known as regenerative ranching, Poncia wants to coax his rangeland to grow more than just grass: He hopes to produce acres of forbs—deep-rooted flowering perennials—like chicory and plantains. Perennials, Poncia explains, “photosynthesize year round, and when they’re photosynthesizing, they’re capturing mother nature’s free energy and storing it as carbon in the soil.”
And that’s what’s making a lot of people very excited about regenerative agriculture right now.
Visit rancher Loren Poncia and hear from scientist Rattan Lal on the latest episode of Bite:
Farming, ranching, and deforestation produce about a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. But agriculture also has the potential to help remove those emissions, at least temporarily, through the creation of natural carbon sinks in grasslands, trees, and cropland.
How much carbon could the world hope to sink? Rattan Lal, a soil scientist at Ohio State University and director of the Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, has been pondering this question for decades. For a paper he published with his team in 2018, he estimated that global soils can recapture about 2.5 to 3 gigatons of carbon a year, roughly the equivalent of taking more than 2 billion cars off the road, and just under a third of what would be needed to neutralize the world’s annual carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry. (A gigaton is the same as one billion metric tons. And one ton of carbon is equal to to 3.67 tons of carbon dioxide). When Lal’s team combined that number with the forests’ ability to suck up about the same amount, they projected that we may hope to sequester around 333 gigatons of carbon in all terrestrial ecosystems by the end of the century, the equivalent of drawing down atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions by 156 parts per million.
Coming up with a large-scale estimate is slippery, given all of the factors involved. For one thing, the soil can only sequester so much carbon before reaching a saturation point; what that threshold is and when it is reached depends on the region of the world, the type of land, and how people have treated that soil in the past.
Research led by biochemist Jonathan Sanderman of the Woods Hole Research Center used a massive historical data set to find that we’ve lost a cumulative 133 gigatons of carbon in the soil over the past 12,000 years due to agricultural land use, on par with what we’ve lost from deforestation. It has long been assumed that if we can restore all of the soil in these native ecosystems, we might potentially recapture around two thirds of the carbon lost, which would be 88 gigatons, by the end of the century.
But it would be nearly impossible to reclaim so much land and convert it back to its wild state. Sanderman’s team took a pretty conservative approach in its calculations. Based on the assumption that we’ll have to resort to sequestering carbon mainly in land that we’ve already messed with, and assuming the soil might reach a carbon saturation point in 20 years, Sanderman posits that under best management practices, the best we could hope to recapture is 0.4-1.4 billion metric tons of carbon a year—or up to 28 gigatons by century’s end. That’s still a pretty big dent. That would be like shutting down 26,372 coal-fired power plants for a year.
But even that number strikes Sanderman as optimistic. “All of these estimates assume that everyone around the world adopts new behavior and new technologies,” Sanderman adds, “not only adopts it, but does a good job of adopting it. That’s a very tenuous assumption.”
And no assumption about cattle ranching and carbon drawdown can ignore the animals’ emissions of methane, another potent greenhouse gas. (Read our piece on the exciting potential of seaweed to help solve this problem.)
Stemple Creek ranch is now part of an experiment with the Marin Carbon Project, whose researchers have helped him draw up a “carbon farming plan” and take soil samples. Poncia still hasn’t received the data that would tell him exactly how much carbon his land has sequestered. Either way, he plans to continue regenerative ranching: “It’s better for the land, it’s better for the animal, it’s better for the consumer eating the product, and it’s better for the environment,” he says. If he can help prove that the model’s successful, he says, “more and more people are going to have opportunity to eat good meat, and at the same time, it’s going to regenerate the soil and help solve global warming.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

It is, as near as I can tell, the most complete plan in the known world, paying literally 100 percent of all health care expenses. That means medical, dental, vision, and mental; and it means no premiums, no copays, and no deductibles. No country in the world does this, so we’d be top dogs for sure if something like this passed.
And now for the nitty gritty. At great cost to my sanity, I have created a spreadsheet laying out the costs and payments for Warren’s plan. Some are taken directly from her white paper while others are estimates based on current costs and some slightly vague statements on Warren’s part. All of them are 10-year costs. Here it is:
As you can see, it doesn’t add up, but I can’t quite tell if that’s my fault or hers. You see, Warren says that she’s going to return all the copays and deductibles we currently pay back to us. That’s an $11 trillion hit. But nowhere does she specifically account for how she’ll make up that money in other funding:
Sure enough, those taxes are there, but if you apply them to the $11 trillion you can’t also apply them to the rest of the $39 trillion that needs to be paid for. So it looks to me like, one way or another, Warren is short by about $8 trillion.
But I might have a few numbers wrong or miscalculated here, so I’ll wait a bit to see if someone else produces a more detailed accounting. In the meantime, I’ll note that $8 trillion amounts to about $600 billion in the first year of operation, which is not insurmountable. I also note that there’s no line item for recouping current spending on Obamacare, which amounts to about $1 trillion over ten years.
In other words: don’t take this too seriously yet. This is the best I could do with the document Warren posted, but I might have some line items wrong. Alternatively, Warren might have some line items wrong. Everyone stay cool for a while until it’s all worked out.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The CIA Is Partly to Blame.,Dan Spinelli,MotherJones,Politics,"This week brought more grim news from the US war in Afghanistan, which is now in its 19th year.
The United Nations reported a 42 percent increase in civilian deaths in July-September compared to the same period in 2018. The NATO-led military coalition, which generally underestimates civilian harm relative to the UN, found a nearly-identical 39-percent increase for June-September. This stretch, documented in a filing published Wednesday by the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, covers key events such as the Afghan presidential election and the breakdown of peace negotiations between the Taliban and the United States. During that time, several horrific attacks linked to the Taliban and ISIS’ Afghan offshoot took place at weddings, mosques, and other public venues.
The United States and its allies are hardly free from responsibility for the carnage. In July, a UN report said American-led forces and Afghan security officials were responsible for a majority of the civilian deaths in the country during the first six months of the year. On Thursday, Human Rights Watch unveiled evidence of atrocities by fighters aligned with the CIA, which has been training Afghan paramilitary units to fight terrorists for nearly two decades. The report identified 14 cases over the past two years in which “CIA-backed Afghan strike forces committed serious abuses, some amounting to war crimes.”
The intelligence community does not reveal the location or result of most of its raids, but reporting by HRW and news outlets like the Intercept have shed light on the gross overreach of CIA-backed operations. At a national security forum in October 2017, then-CIA director Mike Pompeo said that with President Donald Trump’s support, he and the agency’s leaders “were taking several steps to make CIA faster and more aggressive.” It quickly became clear what he meant. A New York Times story later that month reported that the CIA was “expanding its covert operations in Afghanistan” by sending agency personnel and contractors to help Afghan forces “hunt and kill Taliban militants across the country.”
A CIA spokesman told Reuters that the agency conducts its operations “in accordance with law and under a robust system of oversight.” But for months, the UN has flagged dangerous excesses by these CIA-backed groups. In its 2018 annual report, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan warned of there being “no legal basis for the existence of the Khost Protection Force,” one such unit, adding that “Afghan authorities have not taken the necessary action to hold members of this group accountable with respect to allegations of excessive use of force, intentional killings, and other abuses that severely impact the human rights and the lives of Afghans.”
More troubling news arrived on Tuesday with the publication of a memoir by Guy Snodgrass, former aide to ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis. During an overseas trip with Mattis to the Middle East, Snodgrass writes, he was ordered to redo the Trump administration’s Afghanistan strategy “in one day” after a first draft from the Pentagon’s policy shop proved unsatisfactory. Despite not having participated in “any rollout or strategy planning meetings,” Snodgrass states that he completed the task. Given the time constraints, he says he was forced to bypass the policy office, which was responsible for crafting the strategy in the first place.
None of this happens in a vacuum. As Snodgrass told me in an interview earlier this week, a “chaotic administration” produces an “incredibly dangerous” environment for national security policymaking.
“It’s not like there’s a well-thought-out strategy that’s simply being enacted as we go along,” he said.

His top two picks for the job don’t meet the legal requirements to be made acting secretary. Neither Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, nor Mark Morgan, the acting head of Customs and Border Protection, has been confirmed by the Senate. And neither is in the line of succession for the job or has served more than 90 days under the previous DHS secretary. That makes them ineligible to be tapped as acting secretary under the Vacancies Act with the current chief, Kevin McAleenan, stepping down.
The administration needed a workaround, and it landed on an obscure one, using an office called the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.
The administration’s argument is that the leadership position of CWMD is a lower office, to which the executive has unrestrained power in its appointments. The New York Times reported earlier this week that from there, the administration thinks a nominee like Cuccinelli could be lifted to the DHS secretary position.
Even prior to these developments, CWMD was shrouded in controversy. Its last head, James McDonnell, resigned last month at McAleenan’s request. McDonnell, a Trump appointee, spent his tenure downsizing the department, promoting disputed metrics for anthrax detection, and sending its employees scurrying to other jobs.
Friday brought news that the administration may back away from its plan and name an acting DHS secretary who more clearly meets the criteria for the job. But given the intrigue around CWMD, I spoke with Miles Pomper, senior fellow at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, about why the office shouldn’t be politicized, and why it needs a worthy leader more than ever.
Mother Jones: Can you tell me a little about about what the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office does?
Miles Pomper: It’s supposed to prevent terrorists from carrying out a WMD attack and getting the materials that they would need to do so.
MJ: Tell me about the transition from CWMD’s predecessor, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, to CWMD under President Trump.
MP: It was in the process to some degree before Trump came in. Some people were concerned about what would happen to the DNDO, which people kind of regarded as a crown jewel of the US government, but they had good people who were running it, so it didn’t really matter that much. Then Trump came in and appointed this guy who was…not very good. That kind of compounded the bureaucratic problems.
MJ: How important an office is CWMD in DHS?
MP: Well, it’s very important. Not just for DHS, but for national security. We’re talking about protecting the country from terrorists using WMDs. I can’t really think of a lot of threats that we would be more worried about.
MJ: What qualifications should the head of that department have?
MP: You want someone who’s had significant national security background, particularly in the WMD space.
MJ: To your knowledge, do Cuccinelli or Morgan—
MP: No. I mean when these guys are getting appointed, it’s obvious what their priorities are for homeland security. That’s only immigration, apparently, which is an important function, but so is protecting the country from terrorists.
MJ: What are the consequences of leaving this position without a committed steward?
MP: Well I think the real thing is, sometimes you’d have an acting person, that would be fine, but the last occupant really gutted this office. And, to credit the previous secretary for at least recognizing that and forcing him to resign after it was destroyed—but you really need someone there who can come in and clean up the mess and get these national treasures back to doing what they do well.
MJ: So if this administration is serious about CWMD, what steps should they be taking right now?
MP: The first step is they should appoint someone competent to run the office, who’s got the right experience. There’s plenty of those people in the government. Plenty of people who are Republicans, and so on. There’s no shortage of people they could find who are capable of running this kind of thing. I don’t know why they would choose people who don’t have this ability. I mean, what message are you sending to your staff if you tell them that we’re just using this as a pass-through to sneak our way around Congress and political opposition rather than taking the mission seriously?

A half-year later, Nielsen’s replacement is on his way out, and Trump’s apparent pick to replace him is…Nielsen’s former chief of staff.
Trump almost certainly doesn’t want Chad Wolf, a mostly unknown former lobbyist in charge of DHS’s policy office, running the Cabinet department most responsible for carrying out his attacks on immigration. The problem is that he doesn’t have much of a choice. He’s been so negligent about appointing people to run DHS that there’s no one to his liking in the line of succession. Nine of the 11 top DHS positions are vacant. If Trump had bothered to nominate people and pushed the Senate to confirm them, he could have chosen among them for acting DHS chief.
But the rules require him to pick someone already confirmed by the Senate, in the line of succession, or having served at least 90 days under the previous secretary. His top hardline picks don’t meet those criteria, and so he’s stuck with Wolf.
The New Yorker’s Jonathan Blizter wrote of Nielsen’s rise to power:
Wolf is another no-chance-in-hell pick in a normal administration pick. During the George W. Bush administration, he was an assistant administrator at the Transportation Security Administration before spending the next 11 years at a DC lobbying firm. He joined the Trump administration as the TSA’s chief of staff before eventually becoming the chief of staff for all of DHS, which oversees the TSA.
Today, his official title is Assistant Secretary of Strategy, Plans, Analysis, and Risk and the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary of Strategy, Policy, and Plans. Trump has nominated him to be the permanent undersecretary, but the Senate hasn’t confirmed him yet.
Acting US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli, whose Twitter feed is a case study in nativist fearmongering, would have been more to Trump’s liking as a DHS secretary. But he’s not eligible to run DHS on an acting basis without using a loophole that would invite legal challenges. The same goes for the the also acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Mark Morgan, who got his job by talking tough on immigration on Fox News. (Trump is reportedly considering nominating Morgan to replace Wolf on a permanent basis, if he can be confirmed by the Senate.)
So that leaves Trump with Wolf, who once lobbied on behalf of immigrants working in the tech industry. As Wolf emerged as a candidate to run DHS, RJ Hauman, the government relations director at the anti-immigration Federation for American Immigration Reform, told Politico, “President Trump can choose to be on the side of his base and American workers, or throw in his lot with the swamp” by picking Wolf. Trump is going with the swamp. But unlike with, say, corporate tax cuts, it’s not because he’s pulling fast a one on his base. In this case, it’s just sheer incompetence.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The UK-native only has one album (the self-titled Dua Lipa) but two Grammy’s—Best New Artist and Best Dance Recording.
Since the LP’s 2017 release, Lipa has only released a handful of new singles—most of them collaborations. (Well, all of them have been collaborations except for “Swan Song,” her contribution to James Cameron’s sci-fi fantasy film Alita: Battle Angel.) With the release of the Calvin Harris collab “One Kiss,” she became a club staple (it peaked at number one on Billboard’s Dance/Club).

Then came “Electricity.” A collaboration with Diplo and Mark Ronson’s Silk City, the song cemented her in the club music scene and netted her that Best Dance Recording Grammy. But it also left an audience unsure if her bold debut would be the beginning and the end.
Lipa needed to ring in a new era without abandoning her past. She couldn’t just change her hair (even though she did). Instead, she embraced the beats of her recent history and infused some of the original pop strings and keys that made Dua Lipa so fun.
“Don’t Start Now,” her new single for an upcoming sophomore album, draws a line backward. It begins as a modern pop song—synthy and echoing with reverb. Soon, the disco sound explodes. It becomes as carefree as a CHIC track—she’s literally been in the studio with Nile Rodgers for this upcoming album. It’s still Lipa pulling from the collaborations of her recent tracks—”Don’t Start Now” has the power and energy of the club bops she’s found comfort in—but finds a way to fit in with her own bold history.

It’s just before 5 p.m. on a sticky summer evening late in August when we pull up in front of her modest suburban house in Chesterfield, Virginia. “I need a few minutes!” Bynum-Coleman tells Rob Silverstein, her 28-year-old campaign manager, when he calls to say we’re outside. He turns to me after hanging up. “It’s okay to be a little late to your own fundraiser,” he says. “Make an entrance.”
A month earlier, Bynum-Coleman, 47, made her entrance into the political spotlight when national political groups jumped into Virginia’s upcoming statehouse elections with a slew of endorsements and millions of dollars in campaign contributions, including more than $250,000 to her campaign. State elections aren’t usually thrust into the national political conversation—especially in an off-year election when there are no presidential or congressional races—but the upcoming ones in Virginia carry a lot of added weight: If Democrats win control of the state’s legislature, it would be the first time the party controlled the full government since 1993. What voters decide in November won’t just shape the state’s political future for the next decade, but could give the country a hint as to what might happen in the 2020 presidential election. Because of the timing and political history of Virginia’s state elections, analysts often see the state as a political indicator for where the country might go next. And in the wake of several mass shootings this year, the debate over gun control has become a leading issue for voters nationwide and reshaped the political implications of many national and local campaigns. That’s especially true in Virginia, where a shooter entered a municipal building in Virginia Beach in May and killed 12 people.
And at the center of it all is Bynum-Coleman, a real estate agent, developer, and mother of five who has made gun control a central message in her campaign against the most powerful Republican in the state, Kirk Cox.
As speaker of the GOP-controlled House, the 62-year-old Cox, who has represented Virginia’s 66th District since 1990, has thwarted Virginia Democrats’ push to pass several pieces of progressive legislation—even ones with bipartisan support. He’s kept the state’s Equal Rights Amendment in legislative purgatory, blocked measures to ban housing and workplace discrimination for LGBTQ residents, and opposed raising the state’s minimum wage. And in a move that reinforced Bynum-Coleman’s decision to run against him, he prevented gun control legislation from passing.
Strengthening gun control laws has long been an uphill climb for Virginia Democrats. The state is home to the National Rifle Association, whose vast financial influence in American politics was on full display during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Historically, the NRA hasn’t had to flex its political muscle much in the Old Dominion state, but that all changed after the Virginia Beach shooting. A month after the shooting, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam convened a special session to pass gun control legislation, but the session lasted all of 90 minutes after the Republican majority of the Assembly—with Cox at the helm—voted to adjourn the session without passing any gun control measures. All day long, the NRA was there, posted up inside Cox’s office.
But now Cox’s reign is under threat. Not just by Bynum-Coleman’s ability to attract more national support than a typical state-level campaign—she’s raised more than a million dollars (though trails Cox’s haul of $1.5 million) and received endorsements from organizations like Moms Demand Action, Brady United Against Gun Violence, the Human Rights Campaign, and EMILY’s List—but because the state’s previous legislative boundaries were tossed out by federal courts due to racial gerrymandering, a decision recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. For Cox’s district, that’s meant a big shift of voters from predominantly white and Republican Richmond suburbs to the more racially and politically diverse communities of Wilkinson Terrace, Matoaca, and Bynum-Coleman’s community of Chesterfield. Using data from the US Census Bureau and the Virginia Division of Legislative Services, the Virginia Public Access Project—a nonpartisan data organization dedicated to Virginia politics—predicts a 32-point shift in Cox’s district, pushing it to 53.2 percent Democratic voters and 46.8 percent Republican.
It is one of six GOP districts that have been redrawn to benefit Democrats, threatening to erase the GOP’s three-seat majority in the House. Cox is feeling the heat: For the first time in decades, he took to the debate stage to convince voters that he should stay in office. “We have gotten to where we are in Virginia, I think, because of very balanced, sound policies,” Cox said during the debate, where he avoided directly answering questions about gun control legislation and climate change. “It’s the Republican majority that’s trying to keep those.”
The aspiration among the state’s well-heeled Democrats to undo that majority was palpable and optimistic at Bynum-Coleman’s August fundraiser, which she eventually arrived at as stragglers were rushing to check in. The venue, in a posh clubhouse in a neighboring district, was packed with dozens of Democratic fundraisers eager to mingle with their party’s new rising star. Bynum-Coleman represents the new face of the state’s resurgent Democratic Party—a young black woman who entered the political arena because she was fed up by a lack of progress she was seeing in her community.
“I’m running against the most powerful Republican in the state of Virginia, and this election is going to impact people’s lives,” Bynum-Coleman said with calm confidence. “There’s some nights I can’t sleep. When I knock on people’s doors and they tell me they need me to win, that’s not something I take lightly. That’s big to me.”
The push to strengthen Virginia’s gun control laws is at the center of the state’s shifting political identity, and there’s a lot of hope that these legislative elections will reflect that. According to a recent Washington Post–Schar School poll, gun policy is the top issue for Virginia voters. Other statewide polls show strong bipartisan support for passing gun control measures, including universal background checks, limits on concealed carry, and a ban on assault-style weapons. A poll last year found that 54 percent of voters thought it was more important to control who can buy guns than to protect the rights of gun owners.
“The politics of guns in Virginia is a powerful example of how the state’s political culture has changed very rapidly,” says Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. For decades, he says, Democrats wouldn’t talk about gun control outside of the bluest urban districts because of NRA’s political influence in the state.
But support for gun control has slowly increased in the state since the mass shooting on the campus of Virginia Tech in April 2007 and intensified greatly in the wake of the Virginia Beach shooting. “If the public is moving in a certain direction, you as a politician would be unwise to ignore it,” Farnsworth says.
For Bynum-Coleman, the gun control push is personal. In 2016, her daughter was shot at a party when an argument between two people led to an exchange of gunfire. She survived and made a full recovery, but the experience seriously shook Bynum-Coleman. “Just imagine getting a call in the middle of the night that your child has been shot,” she says with shaky breath when I ask her about the incident. “It was a very traumatic experience.” Earlier, her cousin was shot 23 times in two separate incidents. “Just seeing the gun violence in my community, it’s always been a concern,” she says. “Never knew what I could personally do about it—I just wanted to see something change.”
It’s no coincidence that the NRA set up shop in Virginia in 1993. For decades, the state has been home to some of the loosest gun control laws in the country. That was especially true before 1993, when the state passed a law limiting the number of handguns an individual could purchase in a month. “People would come to Virginia,” Randy Rollins, the former secretary of public safety under Gov. Doug Wilder, told Virginia Public Media earlier this summer. “They could go to a gun dealer. Buy 25, 30 weapons, put them in the back of their car, take them to DC.” That law was repealed in 2012 by the state’s GOP-controlled legislature and Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican who had voted to approve the original law when he was a member of the state’s House in the ’90s.
In recent years, the GOP-led legislature in Virginia, with Cox at the helm, has used its narrow majority to thwart any gun control legislation. In the aftermath of the Virginia Beach shooting, Cox and his fellow Republicans pulled a Mitch McConnell at the special session and refused to vote on any of the gun control bills introduced by both Democrats and Republicans, ending the proceedings after just 90 minutes.
Outside the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond on the morning of the session, Bynum-Coleman joined hundreds of gun control activists demonstrating outside. She was energized by the size of the crowd gathered in the sweltering July heat to demand gun control laws, which far outnumbered the pro-gun contingent, she recalls. But inside the Capitol, a conference room in Cox’s office turned into a de facto war room for NRA officials, who strategized about counter-protest efforts and distributed hundreds of t-shirts and hats to pro-gun demonstrators. Virginia Democrats were stunned by Cox’s move to end the session after just 90 minutes, but the NRA had spent weeks guiding the GOP leadership on how to handle the session, the Washington Post reported. Virginia voters may want tight gun control laws, but the NRA’s grip on the state’s GOP leadership is tighter. So far this election cycle, the NRA—amid its myriad financial struggles and internal turmoil—has spent $273,000 to help state Republicans stay in control, according to VPAP, much more than it has in any previous state election cycle.
The issue of gun control isn’t just a leading concern for the Virginia state elections, but for the upcoming 2020 presidential election, and many national political groups are looking at Virginia as a bellwether. To that effect, national gun control groups have spent a historic amount of money in Virginia. Everytown for Gun Safety has pumped $2.5 million into the state’s 2019 elections, while Giffords, the gun violence prevention research and advocacy group co-founded by former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, just launched a $300,000 digital ad campaign to help its endorsed candidates—including Bynum-Coleman—get elected. Cox, through his political action committee, has received $1,500 from the NRA thus far.
Cox and his GOP colleagues’ control of the Virginia legislature was by design. The oldest legislative body in the Western Hemisphere has ping-ponged back and forth between the two parties for decades, but for the past 20 years, the GOP has controlled its House of Delegates. The state went for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election by more than 5 points, but in the 2017 midterms, Republicans barely held onto the House because of a race that was so close the winner’s name was literally drawn out of a hat.
Democrats in the state had a banner year in 2017, but they probably would have gained more seats had it not been for the gerrymandered maps that Republicans passed in 2011. Though Democrats won the statewide vote for the Assembly by 9 points in 2017, Republicans narrowly maintained control of the body because of district lines that packed majority-black parts of Richmond and Hampton Roads into overwhelmingly Democratic districts. But in 2018, after a years-long court battle, a federal court ruled that the Assembly map was unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered and ordered that 11 districts be redrawn, including Cox’s district.
Cox didn’t take the ruling lightly. “The modules selected by the Court target senior Republicans, myself included, without a substantive basis in the law,” he said at the time. “We are confident that the Supreme Court will not allow the remedial map the court appears to be on its way to adopting to stand.” It did, in a 5–4 ruling.
And so, as the Virginia heads into the next redistricting cycle in 2021, the future of Virginia’s legislative maps—and the state’s politics—for the next decade lies in how well the Democratic candidates in those redrawn districts fare on November 5.
With gun control at the center of the political debate, Virginia’s elections have come to be seen as a sort of referendum ahead of 2020, and it has drawn outsize attention. Progressive political groups continue to funnel millions of dollars to Democratic candidates in tight races, and celebrities like Alec Baldwin, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Debra Messing, and Mark Ruffalo have endorsed candidates in swing districts. And Bynum-Coleman has made the issue central to her campaign. In late September, Everytown produced a television ad for Bynum-Coleman that pulled no punches in criticizing Cox’s relationship with the NRA: “Kirk Cox cares more about the gun lobby than our families.”
That’s the message she’s been repeating on the fundraising circuit, where people always introduced her with some version of “the future of the Virginia Democratic Party.” At several fundraisers I attended—near her home district in Virginia and in Washington, DC—she told the same stories. How her son with a learning disability struggled to get resources at school, prompting her first run for the state House in 2015. The myriad challenges she’s faced as a black woman. But the one that always elicited dead silence and solemn stares is when she recalls the horror of getting a phone call in the middle of the night that her child has been shot. And then she would follow up the story with the same talking points about how important it is for Virginia to pass stronger gun control laws and how shameful it was that her opponent punted on doing so. And every time she brought it up, her audiences sternly shook their heads in agreement.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But the Trump-Russia scandal is about to make its own comeback. On November 5, Donald Trump’s longtime political adviser Roger Stone—the dirty trickster who had for years encouraged Trump to run for president—will go on trial in a federal court in Washington, DC, facing charges that he lied to Congress about his interactions with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign, as the organization was publicly disseminating Democratic material stolen by Russian hackers. Stone also was indicted for allegedly obstructing justice and witness-tampering. Though the trial will determine whether Stone tried to bamboozle a congressional investigation, it could answer two bigger questions about the president: Did Trump use (or try to use) Stone as a conduit to WikiLeaks, and did Trump lie to special counsel Robert Mueller? The former might not be illegal; the latter could be a crime.
In the publicly released version of Mueller’s final report, Stone, the flamboyant provocateur and conspiracy theorist, is conspicuously absent. The Justice Department redacted most of the portions of the report that referenced Stone because his trial was pending. So it’s unclear what Mueller had on Stone. But the report contains clues suggesting that the full story of Stone’s involvement in the Trump-Russia scandal goes beyond what’s publicly known—and that it implicates Trump.
As has been already documented, Stone, during the Russian attack on the 2016 election, repeatedly declared he was in contact with WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. Throughout that stretch, he sent out tweets predicting WikiLeaks would release material that would torpedo Hillary Clinton’s campaign—tweets that reinforced the impression he was in communication with WikiLeaks while it was part of the Russian operation. Stone—who remained in contact with Trump and his campaign after he was ousted from his official role in the Trump 2016 effort—also privately communicated with Guccifer 2.0, an online persona created by the Russian hackers. And Stone repeatedly claimed in public that Moscow had nothing to do with the hack of the Democratic National Committee servers, echoing Moscow’s propaganda. After the Russia scandal exploded, Stone changed his story and insisted that he had not been in direct touch with WikiLeaks and Assange. That is, he has essentially said he was lying and exaggerating during the 2016 campaign. He maintained it had all been “posture, bluff, hype.”
Yet Mueller’s report tantalizingly suggests that, in 2016, Stone directly interacted with Trump about WikiLeaks and its plans to release the documents pilfered by the Russian cyberthieves. The report includes this highly redacted section:
This shows that Trump sought inside information on what material WikiLeaks had and what it intended to do with the stuff. And it’s clear that in this tight campaign circle of Paul Manafort, the campaign manager, Rick Gates, the deputy campaign manager, and Trump, there was at least one other player—whose name was redacted—whom the campaign was relying on to find out what Assange was up to. At one point, according to the report, Trump apparently spoke to this person or someone else about what WikiLeaks had coming.
Beyond the Mueller report, the New York Times reported that Stone in 2016 traded emails with Steve Bannon, Trump’s campaign CEO after Manafort departed. In those emails, Stone purported to have inside information on Assange’s plans for releasing the hacked Democratic emails. WikiLeaks would release “a load every week going forward,” Stone told Bannon on October 4, 2016.
Both Bannon and Gates are expected to testify as prosecution witnesses in Stone’s trial—an indication the proceeding will confirm that Stone was in contact with Trump campaign higher-ups about WikiLeaks during the election. Part of the federal case against Stone is that he lied to lawmakers when he said he had not communicated with the Trump campaign about what he knew (or claimed to know) about WikiLeaks’ plans. Stone’s and Gates’ testimony could address that and show whether the Trump campaign—and Trump himself—saw Stone as a go-between with WikiLeaks or a source of inside skinny on the Russia-WikiLeaks operation against Hillary Clinton. A person familiar with Bannon’s role in the trial says Bannon expects to testify that he communicated with Stone and that Stone “was portraying himself to Bannon as someone who was in touch with Assange.”
Back to the mystery man in the redacted paragraph from the Mueller report. It’s tough to think of anyone else in the Trump-Russia saga who would fit this bill other than Stone. The reason provided for the redactions in this section—the information could harm an “ongoing matter”—is a strong hint that Stone’s name appears under those blacked-out stretches. If so, that would mean Stone had been passing information to Trump and the campaign about WikiLeaks. In that case, one question would be if that information came from WikiLeaks itself—or if Stone had received it from another source or was just pretending to know more than he did.
Why does this matter? There are several reasons. First, if Trump or his senior campaign aides thought Stone was communicating with WikiLeaks—whether or not he actually was—and they were receiving information from him related to WikiLeaks, that would mean they believed then that the Trump campaign had a back-channel contact to WikiLeaks as it participated in the Russian operation. Trump has long shouted there was “no collusion.” But perhaps Trump thought at the time that he and his campaign were colluding. After all, a significant Trump adviser consorting with WikiLeaks at this point could be construed as some sort of collusion.
Stone’s trial could yield evidence (beyond his emails with Bannon) indicating whether Stone was talking to Trump or anyone else in the campaign about WikiLeaks—and whether he was viewed within Trump’s inner circle as a conduit to Assange. If Trump and the campaign in any way had tried to reach out to WikiLeaks through Stone while WikiLeaks was facilitating a Russian assault on an American election, that would be a big deal.
The Stone trial could also produce material that challenges what Trump told the special counsel. The president refused to be interviewed by Mueller, but Trump agreed to answer a set of written questions—as long as the queries only covered what happened during the campaign, not any activity that occurred after he became president (meaning actions related to the allegations that Trump obstructed justice). In the questions Mueller submitted to Trump, he asked several times about Stone, including these three:
In his written responses, Trump made these two statements:
Trump acknowledged that he had spoken with Stone “from time to time during the campaign,” but the man who has often boasted he has a great memory added that he had “no recollection of the specifics of any conversations he with Stone between June 1, 2016, and Election Day.”
Go back and read the paragraph from the Mueller report above. Who did Trump speak to on the phone during the ride to the airport? And when Manafort was under pressure to get information on WikiLeaks, who did he turn to? Who was pressing Manafort to find out WikiLeaks’ plans? Could it be someone other than Trump? Unless there’s a character in the story who has yet to be revealed, it seems probable that Stone was the guy trying to gather information from WikiLeaks for the Trump campaign—and that Trump knew about this.
Will the Stone trial provide answers? A lawyer for Stone did not respond to questions from Mother Jones. But any material presented in the courtroom that fills in the redactions would go far toward resolving all this. The evidence could also reveal whether Trump lied to the special counsel—which would be obstruction of justice and a crime. (Mueller’s final report, however, noted that Justice Department policy prohibits the indictment of a sitting president.) Throughout the Russia scandal, Trump has been caught in assorted lies, as he has continuously denied or dismissed the Russian attack that helped him become president. That scandal may be taking a back seat to the Ukraine controversy fueling the ongoing impeachment inquiry (though, in a way, the Russia affair led to the Ukraine scandal, with Trump pressing the Ukrainian president to investigate—and prove—a nutty conspiracy theory that claimed Moscow did not hack the 2016 election). This trial of a conniving Trump confidante who specializes in the political dark arts will be a reminder of the original scandal of the Trump administration that has tainted and undermined his presidency, and it could add another big lie—and a possible crime—to Trump’s long record of wrongdoing.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

These Conservatives Don’t.,Nathalie Baptiste,MotherJones,Crime and Justice,"“Criminals who murder our police should get the death penalty,” Donald Trump said to loud cheers at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference on Monday. The president loves the death penalty. He’s called for it for those convicted of terrorism, mass shooters, and even drug dealers. So, it came as no surprise when Attorney General William Barr announced in July that the federal government would resume executions after a 16-year hiatus.
But not all conservatives are cheering.
“The death penalty is a failed big-government program,” Hannah Cox, the national director of the Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty said at a press conference on Monday, which happened to coincide with the President’s speech. “The administration is out of step with where the country is going on criminal justice reform.”
Support for the death penalty across the political spectrum has declined since its peak popularity in the 1990s, but support among Republicans remains high. A 2018 Pew Research survey found that 77 percent of Republicans support capital punishment. By contrast, 52 percent of Independents support the practice while 35 percent of Democrats do. But at their press conference, the Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty announced that they had received more than 250 signatures from Republicans, conservatives, and Libertarians who are opposed to capital punishment in hopes that they could convince more conservatives to abandon the death penalty. Republicans remain criminal justice hardliners even after the Democratic party slowly began embracing progressive reforms, but conservatives opposed to the death penalty justify their approach with classically conservative arguments: They see it as an expensive government program rooted in arbitrariness and prone to big-government mistakes. All of which doesn’t align with what their ideology claims to value.
When the Department of Justice announced the resumption of executions, Barr said in the press release, “We owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.” But Earlene Peterson, a Trump voter from Arkansas, doesn’t want what the government thinks it owes her. She created a six-minute video asking Trump to spare the life of Daniel Lee, who is scheduled to be put to death on December 9 for the murder of Peterson’s daughter Nancy Mueller, her son-in-law William, and their eight-year-old daughter. She voted for Trump in 2016 and will do so again in 2020. “I can’t see how executing Daniel Lee will honor my daughter in any way,” she said. “I hope and pray President Trump will give him clemency. That would help me and my family more than anything.”
In 1996, Daniel Lee broke into the Russellville, Arkansas, home of the Muellers. William Mueller was a gun dealer, and Lee and his accomplice Chevie Kehoe, were looking for firearms and money. In the course of the robbery, they murdered the family and deposited their remains in a bayou. They were charged with murder in the aid of racketeering, which made it a federal offense. Though both defendants were charged with three counts of murder, Kehoe was the one who murdered the child after Lee said he did not kill children. Kehoe, who was clean-cut and well-dressed during the trial in 1999, was sentenced to life in prison. The prosecution team initially decided not to pursue the death penalty against Lee, but Department of Justice officials overruled the lawyers. They argued that Lee would be dangerous unless he was put to death. His will be the first of five federal death sentences that will be carried out in December and January.
Despite the argument that one important justification for the death penalty is, as Barr noted, someone compensating victims for their losses, Peterson has been public in her opposition. “The government ain’t doing this for me,” she said in the video. After showing pictures of Nancy and her granddaughter to the camera, Peterson sits outside of her home and recounts the story of the crime that robbed her of a daughter, son-in-law, and grandchild. “I believe you have to pay for what you do,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean death.”

Some of Peterson’s family members, like her daughter Kimma Gurel and her granddaughter Monica Veillette agree. Scott Mueller, William Mueller’s son, says it doesn’t matter to him.
Liberals and progressives often argue conservatives shouldn’t be allowed to call themselves pro-life if they are anti-abortion but support the death penalty. Recently some conservatives have begun to acknowledge what they see as that fundamental contradiction. “I am pro-life from conception until natural death,” Ohio state Rep. Niraj Antani, said on the CCADP press call. Darcy Van Orden, founder and executive director of the Utah Justice Coalition, a criminal justice reform organization, echoed Antani’s sentiments. “I’m a pro-life person,” she explained. “I don’t want government to play God.”
Some other conservatives point to the fact that the death penalty is costly—even in states where it’s rarely used. “Utah spent $40 million dollars in the last 20 years, just to add two people to death row,” Van Orden explained during the press conference. The last person executed in Utah was Ronnie Gardner in 2010. There are currently 8 people awaiting death in the state. In Wyoming, the financial picture is even starker. Although no one has been executed in the state since 1992, and no one has been on death row since 2014, it still costs the state $1 million each year to fund death penalty trials.
For supporters of limited government, it seems obvious that conservatives wouldn’t want the government meddling in such existential questions. “The small government aspect is a driving force for me,” Wyoming state Rep. Jared Olsen said on the press call. “It blows my mind that anyone would want to trust the Justice Department with matters of life and death.” Distrust of the government’s ability to kill inmates is well-deserved. According to a 2014 report by the National Academy of Sciences, one in 25 people currently on death row are innocent. For many conservatives, there is no better example of why the government should no longer be involved than botched execution than the case of Clayton Lockett, the Oklahoma inmate who in 2014 writhed and moaned in pain while prison staffers spent close to an hour trying to inject him with a lethal dosage of drugs. “We don’t trust government to run our healthcare,” Rep. Antani said, “why would we trust government to put us to death?”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Republicans for weeks have argued that the impeachment investigation violates due process because the House had not voted to authorize it. Last week, however, a federal judge ruled that the investigation was legal and that Republican arguments to the contrary are not supported by the Constitution. Still, some Republicans are unsatisfied with the vote; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said “it falls way short,” and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said that Democrats were “trying to put a ribbon on an already terrible process.”
The resolution will place the House Intelligence Committee in charge of public hearings and allow the committee to release transcripts of depositions that have already taken place behind closed doors. Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) will be able to authorize up to 45 minutes of questioning for himself and for Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the top Republican on the committee.

	Politics","In a display of unity that would have been unthinkable just two months ago, 231 House Democrats voted Thursday morning to formalize the impeachment process. Over the summer, the party seemed hopelessly split on the issue. That all changed after the emergence in September of a whistleblower complaint revealing President Donald Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations against his political enemies.
This week, several longtime holdouts from districts Trump won—Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Ron Kind of Wisconsin, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, Anthony Brindisi of New York, and Jared Golden of Maine—announced their support for the impeachment resolution. Democrats also had the backing of Michigan independent Justin Amash, a one-time Freedom Caucus conservative who left the Republican Party earlier this year after calling for impeachment.
Still, two Democrats voted against the impeachment probe Thursday. Here’s who they are:
One of four New Jersey Democrats to flip GOP congressional seats last year, Van Drew has been particularly skeptical about impeachment. “If we are going to have an impeachment inquiry and procedure [leading up to the] 2020 elections, it will be very counterproductive,” Van Drew said in September, according to the Press of Atlantic City. Van Drew, whose district Trump won by 5 points, is among the most conservative members of the House Democratic caucus. He told the Philadelphia Inquirer that impeachment could “secure the presidency for Donald Trump” and, according to the paper, he echoed a series of GOP talking points about the Ukraine scandal. This week, he told Politico that he was leaning toward a “no” vote. “I didn’t know that it was really necessary at this point,” he said.
Like Van Drew, Peterson is one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress. Unlike Van Drew, he’s been on Capitol Hill for decades. His rural Minnesota district has moved sharply to the right in recent years—Trump won it by 30 points in 2016, and Peterson’s recent victories have been narrow ones. “If anyone thinks a partisan impeachment process would constrain President Trump, they are fooling themselves,” he told the Detroit Lakes Tribune in September. “Without significant bipartisan support, impeachment proceedings will be a lengthy and divisive action with no resolution.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

On Wednesday night, a week and a half after tens of thousands of teachers walked out of classrooms to demand more support staff, higher pay, and smaller class sizes, Chicago teachers’ union leaders and city officials announced they had come to an agreement. The highlights include: $35 million toward reducing class sizes; hundreds of new social workers, case managers, and other support staffers throughout the district; and a teacher pay raise of 16 percent over five years.


The strike was the longest in the city since 1987 and echoed the frustrations of recent labor battles in both conservative states like Oklahoma and West Virginia and progressive cities like Los Angeles, Denver, and Oakland. Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) vice president Stacey Davis Gates told Mother Jones ahead of the strike that the contract battle was about equity in the city’s schools: “It is not fair for us to go into school communities and to manage poverty. It is not fair for our teachers to go into these school communities and manage the lack of resources and to manage white supremacy and to manage low expectations.”
The contentious standoff between Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson, and CTU leaders heightened last night when union officials refused to end the strike until the two sides could agree to how many days would be tacked onto the end of the school year to make up for the work stoppage. Earlier in the week, Lightfoot had criticized teachers’ union officials for holding up negotiations and “moving the goalposts.” “Are we really keeping our kids out of class unless I agree to support the CTU’s full political agenda wholesale?” Lightfoot said to reporters.
On Thursday, both sides compromised to add five days to the end of the school year, half the time teachers were out of work. When Lightfoot announced that the city’s 300,000 students (Chicago is home to the third-largest school district in the country, behind New York City and Los Angeles) would return to school tomorrow, CTU president Jesse Sharkey made a point of not standing by her side at the press conference.

“This deal will move us closer to ensuring that our most vulnerable students receive the instruction, resources and wraparound services they need to thrive,” Sharkey said in a statement. “No educator wants to leave their classroom, but our 10-day struggle was the only option we had to enshrine, ensure and enforce real change for our students and school communities. This contract will put a nurse in every school, a social worker in every school and provide a real solution for thousands of homeless students in Chicago.”
Here’s the tentative agreement:

The question is: why is PG&E suddenly cutting power during high winds in California? After all, California has always had high winds. It’s always had lots of wildfires. And utility lines have always been a leading cause of those fires. So what changed?
A small part of the answer is that climate change and other factors have made wildfires more common over the past decade. Another small part of the answer is that more people live in areas that are vulnerable to damage from wildfires.
But the biggest part of the answer is: Judge William Alsup. You see, PG&E has been under probation ever since it was convicted of negligence in a pipeline explosion that killed eight people in San Bruno a decade ago. Alsup is the judge overseeing the probation, and after the Camp Fire killed 86 people and destroyed the town of Paradise last year he got fed up. He’s been after PG&E for years to cut back trees and other vegetation near its power lines—as required by state law—and finally demanded that they stop making excuses and just do it. This coincided with PG&E declaring bankruptcy in expectation of billions of dollars worth of claims from victims of the fire, claims that were highly likely to succeed given that a federal judge was already on record accusing PG&E of years of negligence and disregard for public safety.
PG&E can’t immediately cut back all those trees, of course, so as a stopgap they decided to institute rolling blackouts during periods of high winds, even though they’ve never done that before. Other utilities then followed suit.
There’s much more to the story, but this is the nutshell version. It’s not so much that anything has changed on the ground—2018 was a record fire year, but 2019 is actually below average so far—or that California’s electrical infrastructure has suddenly collapsed. What’s changed is that a judge finally said enough is enough.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The president’s defenders have been particularly aggressive in pushing back against the specific allegation that Trump withheld vital military aid to Ukraine in an effort to secure an investigation of an energy company connected to Joe Biden’s son. But on Thursday, as Congress debated a resolution to formalize the impeachment inquiry, one Republican lawmaker appeared to directly contradict Trump’s defense.
In the middle of a fiery speech attacking Democrats, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) said that the president “was doing his job, ensuring that if taxpayer dollars from my constituents and yours was going to the other side of the world, that it would be paired with a commitment to crack down on corruption at all levels—no matter who someone’s daddy is or what their political ambitions are.”
That’s a clear reference to Biden and his son Hunter, and the implication seems unavoidable: In Babin’s view, Trump withheld military aid in the hopes of securing a “commitment” from a foreign government to investigate the Democratic presidential frontrunner. Babin isn’t claiming the quid pro quo never happened; instead, he appears to be saying that it did happen and that he’s fine with it.
Babin isn’t the first prominent Trump defender to seemingly acknowledge a quid pro quo involving Ukrainian military aid. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney did so earlier this month, when he told reporters that Trump withheld the funds in part to secure a Ukrainian investigation into a conspiracy theory about the Democratic National Committee. Mulvaney later tried to retract those comments.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Did you catch that? “…not just for police officers, but for all citizens at every level, from the indigent living on the street to the President living in the White House“? That’s the National Fraternal Order of Police very unsubtly rebuking congressional Democrats for their investigation into President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scandal. Trump, who has cracked jokes about police brutality and falsely accused his opponents of various capital crimes (“TREASON?”), has been warmly received by law enforcement agencies throughout his presidency, and the FOP, an organization of more than 300,000 law enforcement officers, released its statement one day after the president spoke to the International Conference of Chiefs of Police in Chicago.
Impeachment is not a legal process; it is a constitutional process. But it is unfolding in a way that’s similar to a criminal case: The House is currently in the preliminary stages of investigating reports of a high crime and/or misdemeanor, and if it decides to move forward on impeachment—the equivalent of an indictment—there will be a public trial in the Senate, where evidence will be heard and debated and the defendant will have a chance to defend himself. Due process! FOP’s concerns about transparency are all the more phony coming, as they do, from a group of people who have spent their entire careers preparing cases for grand juries—which as a rule, take place behind closed doors, with no input from defense attorneys.

They certainly don’t represent a “student achievement crisis,” as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos put it.
Besides, if I’ve taught you anything, it’s this: at a minimum, you have to decompose the scores by race to see what’s really going on. Often it turns out that—
Yikes! The 50th percentile is basically the median score, and among African American 8th graders it dropped five points. That’s roughly half a grade level. And the results were even worse among low performers.

According to the Pentagon, the hours-old corpse had been washed and placed in a simple white sheet in accordance with Islamic practice. It was then sealed inside a weighted bag and laid on top of a board, which was tilted until “the body slid off into the sea.”
Back on land, the controversy surrounding Bin Laden’s last splash was just beginning. But beneath the waves, nature was taking its course, quietly and methodically turning the world’s most-wanted terrorist into fish food. You could say Osama bin Laden had received the ultimate green burial, courtesy of the United States Navy.
Obviously, the decision to consign Bin Laden to the deep was motivated by expedience rather than eco-friendliness. Seafarers from Odysseus to Ahab have long known that there’s no better way to quickly be rid of a corpse than to toss it overboard. But only recently has this salty custom been rediscovered as a relatively efficient way to be laid to rest with minimal environmental impact.
“I have noticed a great increase in interest in burial at sea,” says Ann Rodney, an environmental protection specialist in the New England office of the Environmental Protection Agency’s ocean and coastal unit, which oversees burials in American waters. The agency doesn’t have hard data on how many Americans choose sea burial, but Rodney suspects the numbers, though small, are growing. “Ten years ago, I might get one or two calls a year about it. Now I get at least one call a week.”
If you’re intent on going into a watery grave, you’ll need to enlist someone like Brad White, a 52-year-old licensed ship captain who has been depositing bodies in the Atlantic since 2005. His company, New England Burials at Sea, based in Scituate Harbor, Massachusetts, does an average of six full-body burials a year and has 25 “pre-need” requests on the books. People who choose to be buried at sea, he says, “typically have a love for the ocean, do not want to be cremated, and prefer ‘ashes to ashes, dust to dust.’ They want to become part of the Earth again via our oceans.”
To help them realize this, White offers burials that he says are not only historically authentic but environmentally sound. “About five or six years ago, someone kept asking me, ‘Can you do a full body?’, and I kept saying no, since I didn’t want to put a casket in the ocean.” He turned to nautical history for an alternative. Traditionally, 18th and 19th century American and British sailors who died at sea where wrapped in a sailcloth shroud with a few cannonballs or leg irons as ballast and then sent overboard. This inspired White to create the Atlantic Sea Burial Shroud, a canvas body bag that comes in seven colors, with your choice of piping or fringe. The shroud zips up, so there’s no need for the traditional final stitch sewn through the nose—a superstitious precaution meant to rouse the comatose. For ballast, White sells custom-made 37.5-pound cannonballs. “Barbell weights work well, too,” he says.
Besides honoring nautical tradition, White says, a shrouded body has less impact than a corpse inside a coffin—the standard for the Navy, which offers full-body burials for veterans, provided the bodies are embalmed and sealed inside a metal casket with a few holes drilled in it. White prefers not to handle embalmed bodies. “We’re into clean waters and clean oceans,” he says. His system is designed to be as biodegradable as possible. Grommets in the shroud “help the body sink because air comes out. And when a body decomposes, body gases come out. It also allows sea life to go in and do what sea life does. What’s left after everything degrades are the cannonballs, and they make their own reef.”
Plus, White adds, “A Navy ship deploys a body from 10 stories high. We have a gentle deployment system that slides the body into the ocean. It drops maybe six inches to a foot.” (Bin Laden’s body  reportedly fell from the hangar deck of the Vinson, which is about 55 feet above the waterline.)
Beyond cost—White’s full-body burial services start at $9,750—there’s little stopping you from visiting Davy Jones’ locker, though the EPA must be notified within 30 days of your final voyage. The agency’s main concern is that once sunk, bodies stay that way. Burials must take place at least three miles offshore and in at least 600 feet of water (1,800 feet in certain areas, such as the Gulf Coast). If you use a casket, the agency recommends drilling at least six three-inch holes in it to “facilitate rapid flooding and venting of air.” It also suggests adding four pounds of additional weight for every pound of body weight, which means the coffin for a 150-pound person would weigh more than 750 pounds. And to make sure coffins don’t pop open when they hit the water, the EPA advises wrapping them in stainless-steel chains, gift-box style.
The only nod to clean-water standards is a requirement that all wreaths or flowers tossed in the water must be “readily decomposable in the marine environment.” The EPA will get on your case if you dump formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, into a stream or lake, but it won’t blink if you put a body filled with formaldehyde-based embalming fluid into the Pacific Ocean. While there is no research on the effects of sunken bodies on ocean ecosystems, Rodney says that logic suggests it’s minimal. She cites the adage “dilution is the solution.” In other words, it’s a big ocean out there.
The rules for burial at sea are more stringent in the United Kingdom. Bodies can’t be embalmed and must be clad in biodegradable material (“commensurate with modesty”); coffins must be made of softwood and may not have plastic, zinc, copper, or lead fittings. Like the EPA, British regulators are preoccupied with preventing bodies from washing up on shore or getting snagged in fishing equipment. They require coffins to be heavily weighted and drilled with 40 to 50 holes. Just in case, each body must have an ID tag locked around its neck.
Though it is rare, bodies do occasionally resurface. Last September, a fisherman came across a floating corpse, naked except for a sock, a few miles off of Florida’s Atlantic coast. A brief homicide investigation revealed it belonged to a North Carolina man who’d been buried at sea a day earlier, wrapped in a plastic tarp. In 2007, a fishing boat off the Massachusetts coast pulled up the remains of a body that had been buried more than six years earlier.
Usually, the ocean does not give up the dead so easily. As he was developing his sea shroud, White did some of his own research into underwater decomposition, running trials with the bodies of various mammals. “We would use store-bought roast turkeys, chickens. Animal Control supplied us with roadkill foxes, possums, raccoons. We used a little bit of everything,” he recalls. He also consulted FBI forensic experts, who informed him that after two days in the water, most bodies are “unrecognizable.” White concluded that a body and a shroud on the sea floor should completely disintegrate within three to six months.
Results may vary depending on a burial spot’s depth, temperature, and its abundance (or lack) of sea life. Generally, the deeper and colder the water, the slower bodies decompose. A 2008 paper in Forensic Sciences described the differing conditions of remains retrieved from two airplane crashes in more than 1,500 feet of water. A victim discovered off of Sicily 34 days after death was still fully dressed; a three-month-old body found off the southern coast of Africa had been “fully skeletonized” by “highly efficient necrophageous lyssianassids” (i.e., flesh-eating shrimp-like creatures).
Another recent study that monitored pig carcasses submerged in approximately 300 feet of water found that hungry sea critters can have rapid and dramatic effects on the dead. Observing a subject known as “Pig 1,” researcher Gail Anderson wrote, “It immediately attracted a number of animals including squat lobsters, Dungeness crabs and spot shrimp. Two days after it was placed on the ocean floor, a large piece of tissue was removed from the rump…the bite mark left behind suggests that the culprit was a six-gill shark.”
Gory, but that’s what it means to sleep with the fishes. Capt. White speculates that Bin Laden’s body has met a similar fate. Considering that the Arabian Sea is warm (right now its average temperature is in the 80s) and teeming with sharks—well, he says, “Go figure.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

“We’ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,” Dorsey wrote in a tweet thread announcing the post. “While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.”
Dorsey said that Twitter would share more updates about the new policy on November 15 and start enforcing it by the next week.
The decision comes amid the heavy criticism Facebook has received in the last several weeks over its decision to allow politicians to run misleading and outright false ads on its platform. Dorsey appeared to take a subtle shot at Facebook’s position in his tweet thread.


Dorsey’s announcement called for further regulation of the online political advertising industry, as he argued it was “worth stepping back” to reconsider whether “today’s democratic infrastructure” is “prepared to handle” the kinds of advertising his company has helped make possible.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended his company’s decision saying that “I don’t think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 percent true.”
But the company has been hammered for its position, particularly from Democratic lawmakers, who are frustrated that it allows politicians to lie with impunity. Some, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), have tested the limits of the policy. Earlier in October, Warren bought a Facebook ad falsely alleging that Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump.
During her line of questioning in a recent Congressional hearing with Zuckerberg, Ocasio-Cortez asked the Facebook CEO if it would be possible for her to buy ads saying that Republicans had voted in support of the Green New Deal. Zuckerberg replied that he wasn’t sure but that it would “probably” be okay.
Facebook has further irritated civil rights groups with its new position on political disinformation. The policy has even frustrated its own employees, some of who circulated a letter in protest, obtained by The New York Times. Around 250 employees had signed the letter at the time it was published.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But shortly before the event, Facebook made a decision that hit the civil rights community like a gut punch. Two days ahead of the gathering, Facebook announced it would allow politicians to publish false information in Facebook posts, arguing that politicians’ lies are newsworthy and deserve protections that other Facebook users do not. The organization also said it would not factcheck politicians’ paid ads.
After years of trying to get Facebook to remove hate speech and voter suppression from its platform, the civil rights advocates saw Facebook’s move as establishing a truck-sized loophole in its content rules just to avoid taking down President Donald Trump’s campaign ads. Ahead of 2020, they fear the new guidelines will allow the free flow of racist content that puts people at risk of harm and suppresses votes.
“We were taken a bit aback that not only would this news come out, but they would break this news right before the forum without giving us a heads up or having a discussion,” says Rashad Robinson, the president of the civil rights group Color of Change, which organized the event, noting that the decision was made despite previous calls from his organization and others for Facebook to assess the impact of its decisions on minorities before implementation.
The lack of communication over the policy led to tense moments and anger at the gathering, just as advocates felt historic progress was being made. Henry Fernandez, a fellow at the Center for American Progress, accused Facebook from the stage of inventing the policy to avoid a confrontation with Trump. “Because Facebook does not want to say this is really about Trump, it has extended this protection to all elected officials,” Fernandez said. “So now if you are a school board member or sheriff in a small town, you can say the most vile things on Facebook because 300 people voted for you? That’s bad policy, made in fear that conservatives will say Facebook is silencing Trump.”
The reaction from Facebook representatives in Atlanta was that feedback was welcome and that the policy was still evolving, according to advocates who attended. But in the weeks following the forum Zuckerberg has doubled down and defended the new rule multiple times, even as its contours remain hazy and lawmakers and some Facebook employees urge him to reconsider.
Civil rights advocates believe the new policy, which Zuckerberg says is to preserve free speech, has dangerous implications. At a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee last week, Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg whether a member of the American Nazi Party running for office could post hate speech that would be taken down if posted by someone who wasn’t a candidate. Zuckerberg dodged the question, but Casten, who pointed out that a Nazi actually ran for Congress in his home state last year, had highlighted how the rule could become a loophole allowing fascist propaganda. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) then asked Zuckerberg if she could purchase Facebook ads falsely accusing her colleagues of taking certain votes. Zuckerberg said “probably.”
Facebook has set some limits to this hands-off policy. In a major speech at Georgetown University defending the rule, Zuckerberg said “there are exceptions, and even for politicians we don’t allow content that incites violence or risks imminent harm—and of course we don’t allow voter suppression.” Those exceptions mean that Facebook has put itself in the position of deciding whether any given post or ad from a politician incites violence, risks imminent harm, or suppresses votes.
Just last week, a state senator in North Dakota posted a picture of what he claimed was Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) hoisting a gun at an Al Qaeda training camp. “She is trying to get this picture blocked,” Republican Oley Larsen wrote on Facebook. “Share it everywhere.” In another post, Larsen called Omar a “terrorist.” While the image has been widely tied to Omar, it actually depicts a 1978 Somali military training exercise. (Omar was born in 1982.) Larsen came under pressure from his own party and ultimately removed the posts after acknowledging they contained falsehoods, but the posts were permissible under Facebook’s rule. A Facebook spokeswoman, Ruchika Budhraja, confirmed that the company would not have deleted the material had it stayed up, but would have factchecked it, labeled it false, and demoted it so that fewer people could view it. Budhraja says the company’s newsworthiness policy requires a case-by-case balancing of what it perceives is important for the public to see and the risk of harm.
Though Facebook didn’t plan to remove Larsen’s post as an imminent threat, Omar disagreed. She tweeted that Larsen’s post is “designed to stir up hate and violence” and was “threatening my life.” Omar, who is among the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, is a frequent target of caustic attacks from President Trump and the far right. That invective has come with multiple death threats, and she has been forced to travel with an increased security detail.
Trump has targeted the representative not just in speeches and tweets, but also in Facebook ads in which Trump’s campaign says that Omar is anti-Semitic and suggests she is sympathetic to terrorists. “The Democratic Party has sunk so low that they’re embracing Anti Semite Ilhan Omar, who recently minimized the terrorist attacks of 9/11 as ‘some people did something,’” a Trump campaign ad this spring said, referring to an out-of-context line from a speech Omar gave about being Muslim in America after 9/11.
“False ads, false speech, misinformation by politicians is not just about a lie: It’s endangering people’s lives,” says Madihha Ahussain of Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group that has been pushing Facebook for years to remove anti-Muslim groups and content. “They’re really missing the boat.”
Advocates have also been critical of Facebook for allowing Trump’s campaign to publish more than 2,000 ads using the word “invasion” to paint a picture of menacing immigrants storming across the Southern border. “That language is used very specifically by the El Paso shooter, and it’s also used by the synagogue shooter in Pittsburgh,” says Fernandez, who co-chairs Change the Terms, a coalition pushing tech companies to fight hate speech. According to Fernandez, Facebook’s decision to allow the language means “the standard that they’re using seems to go beyond the standard that’s actually used by mass killers who are anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, or white nationalist, or anti-Latino.”
“This policy allows politicians to use dangerous speech that history has shown leads to mass killings,” warns Fernandez, who points out that leaders from Hitler to Rwanda’s Léon Mugesera have used such language “to dehumanize minorities before mass killings.”
On a practical level, Zuckerberg and top company officials don’t yet appear to fully grasp the difficulty of carrying out the new policy. In 2011, political scientist Jennifer Lawless estimated that there are more than 500,000 elected officials in the United States, from Congress to county sheriffs to local water boards. Add in the candidates who run against them in both general elections and primaries, and there could easily be over a million Facebook users now entrusted with a special ability to spread lies.
On a press call last week, BuzzFeed’s Alex Kantrowitz asked Zuckerberg about this very point: “Can anyone just start running for their local school board and then start running ads with misinformation?” The answer was basically yes, as long as they register as a candidate, Facebook will consider that person a candidate under the policy.
“Facebook is saying: If you are a politician who wishes to peddle in lies, distortion and not-so-subtle racial appeals, welcome to our platform,” Vanita Gupta, who runs the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, wrote in a Politico op-ed criticizing the policy. This policy, she argued, sets the stage for politicians to stir up disinformation and racial division as part of their 2020 election strategies. “Free expression is a core principle of our democracy. But so are fair elections.”
For years, Facebook has had a fraught relationship with civil rights groups, which have sued the company for violating federal civil rights laws and lobbied an intransigent Facebook to take discrimination seriously on the platform. Last November, the dialogue deteriorated when the New York Times reported that Facebook had hired a Republican public relations firm to undermine Color of Change. Amid a cascade of bad press, Facebook signaled a renewed dedication to working with civil rights groups. Sandberg took a more visible role in this effort, overseeing an audit of the company’s impact on civil rights, which is scheduled to wrap up in the next few months.
Over the last year, advocates have supported new efforts by the company to tackle voter suppression and hate speech, while cautioning that much more needs to be done. Color of Change has continued to push for Zuckerberg to leave Facebook’s board, where his outsized voting power gives him virtually total control over a company whose user base outnumbers Christianity. Still, with the ice melting, Color of Change and Facebook set out to jointly host the Atlanta forum. “For so many years, all these conversations would happen behind closed doors, they would be off the record, we would be signing NDAs,” says Ahussain, referring to Facebook’s practice of having visitors to its offices sign non-disclosure agreements. “This is the first of its kind with the civil rights community and Facebook coming together in this way in a public setting.”
The decision to allow politicians to publish false information wasn’t the only step by Facebook that threw cold water on the forum. On October 14, Politico revealed that Zuckerberg hosted a series of dinners at his home for conservative personalities, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Fox News host Tucker Carlson, and podcaster Ben Shapiro. The effort, according to Politico, is an attempt to appease Trump, who believes Facebook censors conservatives—an accusation without evidence—and ward off regulation from his Justice Department. The story revealed that while civil rights advocates were enjoying access to Sandberg, the right was going straight to Zuckerberg, and being wined and dined.
“As far as we know, he hasn’t ever had meetings like this with advocates representing impacted communities,” says Ahussain, adding that at “the town hall, Sheryl Sandberg was there, but Mark Zuckerberg was not.”
Zuckerberg has framed his decision not to factcheck politicians’ ads as in keeping with the free speech afforded by Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglass, both name-checked in his Georgetown speech. But when it comes to the policy, it’s unclear if he discussed it with anyone with civil rights expertise. While Budhraja, the Facebook spokeswoman, would not say whether Zuckerberg has ever met in-person with civil rights advocates, she said the company had weighed civil rights when designing the newsworthiness exception and that Zuckerberg had consulted civil rights advocates on the Georgetown speech, but would not elaborate on either claim. According to the Washington Post, Gupta at the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights expressed concerns about the policies in a call with Zuckerberg before the speech, arguing the company lacked the civil rights expertise to make responsible decisions. Zuckerberg reportedly responded that he had “several people from the Obama White House.” It’s unclear if either this conversation with Gupta or the presence of former Obama employees is what Facebook is referring to when it says it has involved the civil rights community in the creation of these policies.
“Regardless of what Mark Zuckerberg will say about the First Amendment, he is willing to allow politicians to lie, to cheat, and to suppress votes because he’s afraid of the Trump Justice Department and potential regulation,” argues Robinson. “And he’s willing to go down in history that way.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The New York Times and the Daily Beast reported on Wednesday that House Democrats summoned Bolton for a voluntary deposition on November 7.
Witnesses in the impeachment inquiry have described Bolton as alarmed by the aggressive efforts of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and EU ambassador Gordon Sondland to pressure Ukraine into investigating Trump’s domestic political rivals. Fiona Hill, Trump’s former top Russia adviser, testified that Bolton told her to tell the National Security Council’s top attorney about the back-channeling. “Giuliani’s a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up,” Hill said Bolton told her.
Trump pushed Bolton, a hardline foreign policy hawk, out of the administration in September amid major policy disagreements.
A spokesperson for House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) declined to comment bout the deposition request. It’s unclear whether Bolton will comply with it. Investigators have also called on former top NSC attorney John Eisenberg and a deputy, Michael Ellis, for voluntary depositions on November 4.

Update: John Bolton’s attorney Charles Cooper says the former national security adviser won’t show up to testify voluntarily.

Thus far, the National Rifle Association has spent $298,000 on campaign contributions to help ensure the state’s GOP maintains control of its state legislature, according to the nonpartisan politics data group the Virginia Public Access Project. That might not seem like a huge number—especially compared to the hundreds of thousands of dollars gun control groups like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence have spent to boost Democratic candidates—but it’s far more than the NRA has ever spent on in its home state.
As the Washington Post reports, the NRA usually spends the bulk of its funds in Virginia through independent expenditures, usually in the form of television ads in support of, or against, a specific candidate. The NRA has so far spent just over $22,000 in independent expenditures this election cycle, which is a lot less than it has in previous years. But since independent expenditures aren’t considered direct campaign contributions, they aren’t tracked in the same way.
A majority of the NRA’s direct financial contributions this year have gone to Todd Gilbert, the state’s Republican House majority leader, who represents a district in the Shenandoah Valley and is facing his first general election challenge in 10 years. On September 3, the NRA made a $200,000 donation to Gilbert, the largest single donation the group has ever made to a candidate since at least 1996, the first year VPAP began tracking money in Virginia’s elections. It also donated large sums of money to two long-time incumbent Republican state senators: $50,000 to Mark Obenshain and $25,000 to Ryan McDougle. Elsewhere, the NRA has contributed smaller sums to candidates in tight races, including to Bill DeSteph, the gun-dealing senator representing the district where a shooter killed 12 people in May, and Kirk Cox, the speaker of Virginia’s GOP-controlled House of Delegates who, in July, ended a special session of the state’s general assembly, which had been called specifically to pass gun control, without even holding a vote.

The NRA has long been an influential force in American politics nationally, and that was never more evident than in the 2016 presidential election, when it spent a massive $54.4 million to help elect Donald Trump. But since Trump took office, the group has devolved into chaos thanks to infighting in its leadership, political scandals, and depleted finances. As the fight over gun control has emerged as one of the top issues ahead of the 2020 presidential race, the nation’s leading gun rights groups has never been in worse shape.
For many political analysts, Virginia’s off-year state elections are often seen as an early indicator of where the country may be headed politically. “These midterms the year before a presidential election are sometimes seen as a vehicle for gauging support for the president’s party nationally,” says Stephen Farsnworth, a political science professor at Virginia’s University of Mary Washington. “Democrats and Republicans both want national bragging rights for Virginia.”
Over the years, the NRA hasn’t traditionally had to spend much in Virginia state elections. In 2017, a year in which Democrats made significant gains in the state’s legislature, the group only spent $31,580 in direct campaign contributions to support Republican candidates—but it reportedly planned to spend up to $750,000 on TV ad buys (VPAP doesn’t have the NRA’s independent expenditure filings listed for 2017) . But as the debate over gun control has evolved since the 2016 presidential election—especially in Virginia, in the wake of a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May—the group has ratcheted up its spending like never before. It’s too soon to say if that will also be the case for 2020—so far the NRA has only spent slightly more than $250,000 in next year’s federal elections according to OpenSecrets—but its influence in Virginia’s state elections this year show that it’s at least willing to put up a fight in the battle over gun control.

Since Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) announced she was leaving Congress on Sunday night, Democratic lawmakers and their staffers on Capitol Hill are grappling with the complicated circumstances of that resignation: Allegations of an affair with a member of her congressional staff, precipitated by the nonconsensual publication of nude photographs. As the female House Democratic aide who cursed the situation told me, “Potential ethics violations are a problem, but what happened to her isn’t right.”
Facing a House ethics investigation, Hill resigned just more than a week after right-wing blog RedState and British tabloid the Daily Mail shared nude photographs of her and after she admitted to a consensual but “inappropriate” relationship with a campaign staffer, but denied allegations of a relationship with a congressional aide. In her resignation letter, the 32-year-old freshman lawmaker blamed the distribution of the photos on her “abusive husband” and “hateful political operatives” enabling “a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation.”
Now, with the ouster of one of their own, women on Capitol Hill are attempting to figure out how to deal with someone they may believe showed poor judgment, but who didn’t deserve her fate.
I spoke with five Democratic women on Capitol Hill since the congresswoman’s resignation—two lawmakers and three aides. All five were unequivocal in condemning the nonconsensual publication of Hill’s nude photographs, a practice known as revenge porn. They were also unified in believing the release of these photographs was politically motivated: The RedState writer who first published the allegations against Hill, as well as the first of the nude photos, has a long history of boosting GOP candidates, including former Rep. Steve Knight, who Hill unseated.
“These are very specific and targeted types of harassment that can have severe offline ramifications in people’s lives,” Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), the House’s fifth-ranking Democrat who works closely with the freshman class, told me. She condemned the posting of photographs “as a way to destroy someone’s life, to shame them, to embarrass them.” Clark has recently taken the lead on legislation that would protect individuals against revenge porn.
The three House staffers I spoke with—who all wished to remain anonymous to speak frankly about the sensitive issues at stake—agree that while people are quick to defend Hill against the release of the photographs, they’re not willing to weigh in on Hill’s conduct beyond that. These staffers weren’t either. “No one wants to veer into the territory of condoning a potential ethics violation,” the first House aide told me. “The [House ethics] rules exist because a subordinate, in being a subordinate, can’t give consent.”
Indeed, last year Congress updated its code of conduct to hold lawmakers accountable for workplace misconduct, a change that followed a wave of #MeToo resignations across both parties in the House and Senate. “We changed our House rules to reflect how seriously we take a workplace that is safe and respectful for every worker,” Clark told me.
“I would certainly hope those rules would be applied equally,” she added.
But some of the women I spoke with were frustrated that there is a stark double standard at play. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) faces several House ethics violations for multiple alleged affairs with his House staff and the use of campaign funds to cover it up. First-year Democratic delegate Michael F. Q. San Nicolas of Guam, also faces an ethics investigation into an alleged affair with a House staffer, but remains in office. And then, of course, there’s President Donald Trump—while not in Congress of course, he’s a man who has been accused of sexual assault by at least two dozen women.
“It’s really sad to see the kind of double standards that are deployed,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) told me. “It’s quite shameful that Duncan Hunter is still a member of Congress and Katie will not be. It is a shame that we have Donald Trump as still our president while Katie will not be serving us in Congress. And it is a shame, truly, that we have members of Congress and people in leadership who don’t rise to the level of integrity that she has shown.”
Omar herself has been the target of frequent racist and sexist attacks since she joined Congress, and a second congressional aide makes the point that what happened with Omar, as well as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and now Hill, fits into a growing pattern. “There’s something recurring here: These members, especially young women, have attracted an unusual amount of scrutiny from the right,” she said. “Their lives have been weaponized in a way that’s not seen by other House members.”
Still, the staffers I spoke with said that however painful, the investigation into Hill was what was required for Democrats to declare themselves the party of morals and ethics—a conversation the third House aide says reminds her of the ongoing debate over the resignation of former Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.).
“We have to be better than Republicans,” the third aide told me. “That means we must condemn this illegal invasion of her privacy. But we also have to condemn the possible ethics violation.”
For her part, Omar told me she’s proud of how Hill has conducted herself in the face of the scrutiny. “I hope that the message that women and young girls around the country are getting is…she’s going to do everything in her power,” Omar says, “to make sure that women have more abilities to not fall prey to the kind of predators that exist out there, that exist your most vulnerable times in life.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

They teamed up with the Liberal Democrats to form a government, but the Lib-Dems insisted on the two-thirds law as a condition of supporting the coalition. Why? Because they wanted a full five-year term. The new law prevented the prime minister from calling an election the first time the polls looked good and he thought he might be able to win a majority on his own.

Randall Williams, the Missouri state health director, said Tuesday that the state health department had been keeping a spreadsheet of patients who had visited Planned Parenthood, with personal data on each patient including the date of the last menstrual period. The state collected this information as a part of its annual inspection of the clinic and later used this information to try to determine whether patients had undergone failed abortions. According to the Kansas City Star, which first reported the news, the spreadsheet also included “medical identification numbers, dates of medical procedures and the gestational ages of fetuses.”
“Today’s revelation is deeply disturbing,” Yamelsie Rodriguez, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region , said in a statement. She added, “Missouri politicians have gone too far. This is government overreach at its worst. It shadows the Trump administration’s history of tracking the periods of refugee girls under the government’s care. This is outrageous and disgusting.”
Williams’ testimony came during an administrative commission hearing taking place this week to determine whether Missouri’s last abortion clinic, a Planned Parenthood facility in St. Louis, will be allowed to keep its license to perform abortions. The hearing began on Monday morning and is set to end on Friday afternoon.
This hearing is the just the latest chapter in a fight between the Missouri Department of Health and the Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region. In May, state regulators demanded to question clinic doctors over “ongoing concerns about deficient practices,” but the clinic declined to make providers available for interviews that it considered a form of intimidation. As a result, the health department refused to renew the clinic’s license to perform abortions, leading Planned Parenthood to sue the state.
If the St. Louis Planned Parenthood fails to get its license renewed, Missouri will become the first state without any abortion clinics since the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling upholding the right to an abortion.
“This is the reality when people in power want to strip away our rights and freedoms,” Alexis McGill Johnson, the acting president of the national Planned Parenthood organization, said in a statement. They force medically unnecessary pelvic exams, investigate menstrual cycles, and do whatever it takes to take control of our bodies, our lives, and our futures. Enough is enough. Every person deserves access to safe, legal abortion without fearing their personal information will be used to wage political war.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The company says the networks have links to Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the Russian oligarch indicted by U.S. prosecutors over interfering in the 2016 presidential election. The operation illustrates how the Kremlin’s playbook on election interference and political meddling is evolving and adaptable.
The Stanford Internet Observatory at the university’s Cyber Policy Center also released a detailed analysis of the networks, noting that while Russia’s efforts to assert geopolitical strength by engaging in Africa militarily and economically are well known, “there is emerging evidence that Russian-linked companies are now active in the information space as well.”
The Stanford researchers studied seven Instagram accounts and 73 Facebook pages, concluding that the pages had made over 48,800 posts, generating 9.7 million interactions, including 1.72 million likes.
In total, the company removed over a hundred Facebook and Instagram accounts targeting audiences in Madagascar, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Sudan, and Libya.
“We’re taking down these Pages, Groups and accounts based on their behavior, not the content they posted,” Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, wrote in the company’s announcement. “In each of these cases, the people behind this activity coordinated with on another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action.”
Gleicher wrote that “the people behind these networks attempted to conceal their identities and coordination,” but that the company’s investigation linked them to Prigozhin, a close Putin ally who is behind Russia’s Internet Research Agency (IRA), which was accused by the US government of creating and operating a social influence campaign as part of broader efforts to undermine the 2016 US presidential election in support of Donald Trump.
The Stanford report notes that the operation made use of Twitter accounts, WhatsApp and Telegram groups, Facebook Live video streaming, and Google Forms, and using a mixture of fake accounts and pages and ones run by contractors living in Africa.
The operations in Libya, which relied on a combination of Egyptian nationals and fake accounts, focused on Libyan politics and policy matters, and portrayed themselves as journalistic efforts, sometimes playing host to multiple sides of a debate. But the pages and memes also generally supported the late dictator Moammar Qaddafi and his son, Sair al-Islam Gaddafi, along with a Russian-backed general, Khalifa Haftar.
In Sudan, the operation also mixed authentic local accounts with fakes ones posing as news organizations to comment on, post, and manage pages that generally offered a pro-Russian point of view.
“Considered as a whole, these clusters of Pages were intended to foster unity around Russia-aligned actors and politicians,” the Stanford team wrote, noting that the tactic differs from the IRA’s approach in the US, sought to exploit existing fissures in domestic political and social debates. By including local content creators, the pages targeting Africa acquired a credibility and authenticity that boosted perceptions they were an trustworthy source.

The rule change in question would have eliminated temporary protection from deportation for migrants in need of vital medical care. It was ultimately reversed amid public outcry.
Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner currently leading US Citizenship and Immigration Services, made the admission under questioning from Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.). In a heated back-and-forth during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing, Pressley pressed Cuccinelli on whether the White House—and Trump’s staunchly anti-immigration adviser Stephen Miller in particular—had a role in the rule change. Cuccinelli hedged but eventually responded in exasperation, “I made this decision. Alone.”

Pressley later tweeted, “Cuccinelli just told me under oath that he is the one that made the policy decision that put critically ill immigrant children at risk of deportation. One step closer to justice for these families.”
The Trump administration made the policy change in early August without notifying Congress, but after public outrage, USCIS said it would start processing requests for reprieve again in September.

Gavin Newsom signed a strict ban on for-profit prisons and immigrant detention centers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement quietly posted a solicitation notice for three new detention facilities in California—a move that advocates are calling a discreet attempt to open up new privately run facilities before the law goes into effect at the start of next year.
ICE is asking for “turnkey ready” facilities near San Francisco, San Diego, and Los Angeles for “the exclusive use of ICE and the ICE detainee population,” according to documents posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on October 16. (When ICE seeks a new contract, the search has to go through a public bidding process.) The facilities would be used to “provide housing, medical care, transportation, guard services, meals, and the day to day needs for ICE detainees,” the documents say. As the Palm Springs Desert Sun first reported, ICE is looking to house up to 6,750 detainees in the facilities.
In the notice, ICE clarifies that it will not accept proposals for constructing new facilities. The notice also includes specific requirements, like being a set distance from ICE field offices and having a certain number of beds. And since California passed a law last year banning any city or county from entering into contracts with ICE or for-profit prison companies to detain immigrants, the only existing facilities that would comply with ICE’s requirements for this contract would be the ones already owned by private prison companies, according to Silky Shah, executive director for Detention Watch Network. “In the amount of time they have for the solicitation,” she said, “it’s going to be tough for a new contractor to offer their services.”
The FBO notice has a response date of October 31, giving interested companies about two weeks to respond. Hamid Yazdan Panah, an immigration attorney with the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, says the timeline shows ICE is trying to secure a new contract before the law goes into effect on January 1. “This is an indication that ICE and private prison companies are working together to respond to California’s ban,” he said.
As written, the ban does not allow the California Department of Corrections to enter into any new contracts or renew any existing contracts with for-profit prison companies. But it says nothing about contracts that will already be in place when the ban is implemented.
State legislator Rob Bonta, a Bay Area Democrat who wrote the original bill, said ICE is trying to exploit that loophole. “Everything about this is gaming the system,” he said. If ICE rushes to sign a contract before January 1, Bonta noted, the new facility would operate for at least five years. And even though the new law explicitly prevents any contract renewals, the FBO notice states that the contracts have two five-year extension options.
Bonta said he anticipated that ICE would try to get around the law, especially since they can no longer sign contracts with any local governments in California. ICE was able to get past that legislation by signing temporary contracts directly with GEO Group and CoreCivic, without municipalities as intermediaries.
In a statement, ICE officials said they were reviewing the bill but that once the law goes into effect, “the impact would be felt by residents of California who would be force to travel greater distances to visit friends and family in custody, and not by ICE.” They did not comment on the solicitation notice.
Currently, ICE has four contracts with private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers with the ability to detain up to 4,694 people. Those detention facilities could close in the next year when their contracts expire. ICE’s contract with GEO Group, the largest private prison company in the state, for the Adelanto and Mesa Verde facilities will expire in March 2020. (In October 2018, the DHS Office of Inspector General conducted a surprise inspection of the Adelanto facility and found “serious” violations of ICE’s own detention standards, and “significant threats to the safety, rights, and health of detainees.”) The contract with CoreCivic for the Otay Mesa Detention Center is also set to expire in June 2020. The Imperial Regional facility in Calexico is under a temporary contract between ICE and MTC, which will end in September 2020.
The ban also comes after a string of detention facility closures in the state. In March, the Orange County Sheriff’s Office announced it would no longer work with ICE to house detainees in its local jails, the James A. Musick and Theo Lacy facilities. (A DHS report in 2017 detailed accounts of detainees being forced to eat spoiled food at Theo Lacey.) Contra Costa and Sacramento counties also ended contracts with the federal agency in 2018.
Bonta sees these latest attempts as a last-ditch effort by ICE to keep working with the private prison companies in the state. “These twisted somersaults to push and bend federal protocols are a sign of desperation,” he said. “It’s what you’d expect from a dying industry.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

On top of her responsibilities as a testing coordinator and case manager, Lauren listened to her students recount the daily traumas they faced—the acts of gun violence, the deaths of family members, the solitude of kids taking care of kids. She wondered what she had gotten herself into. “I was kind of like, I don’t know what I was thinking. I can’t handle this. It’s too much for one person to do.”
“It was definitely a learning experience,” Lauren told me. “You can’t really sit in a classroom and learn about how to run a grief group, like I did in my master’s program. You’re then sitting in front of six middle schoolers that have all lost siblings, cousins or uncles. It’s just completely different than you could imagine.”
On September 10, just a month after she’d started the job, her new colleagues went on strike for seven days, calling for pay raises and more support staffers and railing against controversial reforms pushed by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. They managed to secure an average 17 percent pay raise over four years, and altered Emanuel’s proposal to tie teacher evaluations to test scores. Lauren, who requested anonymity to speak frankly, says she could barely recall the details of that strike because, she says, she was focused on just getting through her first month at the elementary school.
What got her through the year was watching students improve after going through her anger coping group, and hearing from students themselves about what it’d meant to them. “That was the motivation I needed that first year to just get through and realize that maybe I can do this and it is what I’m meant to be doing,” Lauren says. “And it’s still something that drives me every day. Being a counselor is probably one of the most emotionally draining jobs.”
As she settled in, Lauren began to empathize with her colleagues who’d gone on strike. The 33-year-old from Potomac, Maryland was serving as the only counselor at a school of more than 230 preschool through eighth-graders; meanwhile, as she juggled multiple responsibilities beyond her counseling duties at her school, she heard of schools in the north side of the city with both full-time counselors and social workers. The situation felt untenable. Last year, a student had an asthma attack, and officials called an ambulance. The school nurse hadn’t been around that day—they come in once a week—so Lauren, who doesn’t have a medical background, grabbed the EpiPen from her office and was ready to jam it into him when the ambulance arrived. “A counselor should not be having to do that,” she told me. “We’re not trained for that.”
So when the Chicago Teachers Union announced a general strike this month, Lauren joined thousands of her peers to rally in the streets for better working conditions. At the heart of the strike, which entered its ninth day on Tuesday, is a call that felt familiar to Lauren, but also to teachers in cities throughout the country: Teachers want the school district to hire more counselors, nurses, and other support staff. That’s a particular concern in schools on the Chicago’s south and west sides, areas that have historically faced disinvestment.

“There’s so much inequality between the south and west side schools and the north side schools. And that’s all dependent on parent involvement, who people know, the communities, and it’s such an injustice,” Lauren says. “They can’t help what community they are born into and what school that they go to. It’s just not fair to not give them an equal playing field to other students in the same city.”
During the 2015-16 school year, the typical K-12 school counselor worked with, on average, 464 students, far above the American School Counselor Association’s recommended ratio of 250 students for every counselor. Lauren concedes that for an elementary school in Chicago, her caseload is small. She knows all of her kids by their first names, as well as their family members.
Still, “there’s not enough of me” at her school to match the emotional support needed for her students, Lauren says. “You have 250 students, but it’s 250 students with many needs,” she adds. “I don’t have enough time to just be a counselor and serve those students. I don’t have enough time in the day physically to see the students progress as much as I’d like to see them.” Her peers are even less fortunate. “Most of my colleagues have one student for 600, 700, 800 students,” she says.
Earlier this year, Lauren scheduled an anger support class with a group of third-graders when she received a call from a school security guard that a seventh-grader whose uncle died the night before had been “crying uncontrollably.” Lauren dropped her meeting with the third-graders to take care of the kid in an immediate crisis. “She needs to see you right now,” Lauren recalls hearing. She rushed and saw the girl in the hallway and brought her to her office. They spoke for nearly an hour at the end of the day.
But that came at a cost. The third-graders looked for their counselor and asked, “Where were you? We were waiting for group.” “I explained I had to run and meet with another student, but students don’t see it that way. They think, ‘Oh, you forgot.'”
“The most heartbreaking thing to me is to have students say, ‘You don’t have time for me,'” she told me. “That’s the hardest thing to hear, to have to explain to them, it’s not that I don’t want to see you but I have to get the mandated x, y, and z things done for the school. At the end of the day, one counselor per school is not enough to service the high needs that our students have.”
As a result, her students at times become her crisis reporters when their peers are struggling. Lauren recalled a time when a girl told her during lunchtime that a friend of hers contemplated suicide. “I don’t know what to do. Can you go talk to her?” Lauren recalls the girl saying. Lauren pulled the girl out of class to speak to her.
Before teachers went on strike more than a week ago, the seventh-grader whose relative died approached Lauren about her best friend, who had lost her older sister to gun violence earlier in the school year. The girls wanted to start a group session to share their experiences. “They’re like, ‘We’re both going through something so similar. No one else understands,'” Lauren says.
Since the strike, Lauren hasn’t been able to meet with them in person. The girls have spoken on the phone. “We’re passionate about [the strike] because we do want these things. It’s just a shame it has to come to this to get what these kids deserve because we want to be in the classroom. We want to be back at school,” Lauren says. She supports the strike but acknowledges that it’s difficult to see her students miss time inside the classroom. “And so it’s really hard when you hear a lot of negativity like ‘if they really wanted to be down for their kids, they would end the strike early and get back to work.’ But it doesn’t work like that, unfortunately.”
She sees it as a Catch 22: Her and her colleagues picket outside their schools every day for better opportunities for their students, but they see the repercussions their students face when they miss school. Her eighth graders missed their high school fair, an opportunity to meet with representatives from schools in the area. (In Chicago, teenagers have to not only graduate from high school but also show that, by the end of their time, they’ve either gotten a job or made into college, trade school, or the military.) “It’s hard to be outside of the school for this long knowing that our students are missing out,” Lauren says.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Only 3 Presidential Candidates Showed Up.,Samantha Michaels,MotherJones,Crime and Justice,"Dorsey Nunn traveled from California to Pennsylvania for it, but very few of the sprawling field of Democratic presidential candidates bothered to make the same commitment. Of the top tier, only Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker came. (Billionaire Tom Steyer joined too.) “It was interesting that the two people that thought we were important enough to talk to were the two black people running for president,” said Nunn, referring to the formerly incarcerated people who moderated and attended a first-of-its-kind presidential town hall on Monday.
The criminal justice advocacy group Voters Organized to Educate, which coordinated the event, invited the 10 Democratic candidates who qualified for the third debate to come discuss criminal justice reform at a former prison in Philadelphia, to speak directly to formerly incarcerated people and their family and friends. The tens of millions of Americans with conviction or arrest records, said Nunn, are “the sleeping giant in your living room that nobody is talking to.” Nunn himself was incarcerated in California for most of the 1970s and now runs a grassroots criminal justice advocacy group called All of Us or None that has been crucial in spreading Ban the Box policies to help people find jobs after prison.
His organization hosted a watch party on Monday morning at its Oakland headquarters with about a dozen people, some of them formerly incarcerated. A few sipped coffee and munched on pastries as the show got started, sighing when the YouTube livestream repeatedly stalled. Sitting in the second row of folding chairs, Mark Fujiwara, who spent a year in the nearby San Quentin Prison and now works with Nunn, waited patiently for it to resume. By engaging directly with formerly incarcerated people, he said, the candidates would be taking an important step “to validate our humanity.”
Except it was far from all, or even many, of the candidates. Most of the leading contenders, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, instead went to another criminal justice forum over the weekend at a historically black college in South Carolina, livestreamed to a bigger audience by major news outlets. (Harris and Booker went to that one too.) But their absence at the first town hall organized by formerly incarcerated people could send a message, organizers say, that they aren’t placing a top priority on constituents who have been directly affected by the criminal justice system, especially low-income people of color. “It’s telling—they don’t see us as a good investment,” said Steven Czifra, who came to the Oakland watch party with his son. “This is a chance to a have a conversation with formerly incarcerated people, and we have three candidates showing up? I’m sorry, that is unacceptable,” Booker said at the event at Eastern State Penitentiary, which was presented in partnership with The Marshall Project and NowThis News. “This is not a side issue.” (Sanders offered to participate via a video call, but the organizers said it wasn’t feasible; former Housing Secretary Julián Castro spent part of the day visiting with incarcerated people at a DC jail.)
“The other candidates who happen to not be African American are going after the traditional path to gaining the African American vote, going to historically black colleges, going to black churches,” added the Rev. Vivian Nixon, one of the town hall’s moderators, in a phone interview before the event. The weekend forum at Benedict College in South Carolina, where President Donald Trump gave a keynote address and received an award, had a much bigger turnout but largely engaged with college-educated African Americans. As Nixon told me, “They figure they are going to get a bigger bang for their buck. They believe people who have been involved in the criminal justice system don’t vote, which is simply not true.”
Most states restrict voting rights of people who are serving time in prison, and some restrict the rights of people out on parole. But only two states, Iowa and Kentucky, permanently disenfranchise all people with felony convictions. In the rest, formerly incarcerated people can eventually participate in elections. And they’re no small voting bloc: There are more than 2 million Americans currently in prison. More than 70 million Americans have been arrested on felony charges or incarcerated. And 1 in 7 American adults have an immediate family member who has been incarcerated for at least one year. “I don’t understand why people running for office at every level don’t consider us a serious voting bloc,” said Nixon.
That’s not to say Democratic candidates aren’t genuinely trying to push the needle on criminal justice. Most of the front-runners have proposed reforms that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, like abolishing private prisons and ending mandatory minimum sentences, cash bail, and the death penalty. But some are also under scrutiny for supporting more punitive policies in the past: Biden, for his role in writing the 1994 crime bill; Sanders, for voting for it; and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, for failing to hire more black police officers.
Harris and Booker are no exception. The California senator has described herself as a progressive prosecutor who made the system more fair, but critics point to policies she advocated in the past that led to the incarceration of more people of color. At the town hall Monday, when asked whether she believes she went too far with any of her decisions as San Francisco district attorney or state attorney general, she largely dodged the question, saying yes but not going into specifics. At the Oakland watch party, some people groaned as she said she became a prosecutor so she could work from within the system to improve things. “Trying to get on top,” one person muttered. “She’s a cop,” said Fujiwara, adding that he didn’t trust her. A handful of people got up to leave the party as she spoke.
Booker, who spoke last at the town hall, also addressed his own record as mayor of Newark, New Jersey, specifically his initial zero-tolerance policy on crime. After the ACLU complained about stop-and-frisk policing and asked the Justice Department to oversee the city’s police force, Booker changed his views and began to embrace more progressive reforms. “We thought we were doing a good job, but we were not,” he said at the town hall of his experience with police accountability in Newark. “I learned the hard way that this idea of policing, it’s deep, it’s endemic, it has problems. Even people who think they are doing the right thing most likely are not.” At the watch party, some who left the crowd during Harris’ and Steyer’s segments came back for Booker. Fujiwara, for one, seemed impressed, saying he was encouraged by the senator’s proposal to use federal incentives to encourage investment in restorative justice programs.
Some moderators weren’t surprised that Booker and Harris were the ones who ultimately showed up. Despite their history, both senators have prioritized criminal justice reform in the Senate and made it a focal point of their presidential campaigns in a way that few others have. “Kamala and Cory, being part of the African American community, have been exposed to more kitchen table conversations with people directly impacted by mass incarceration,” said Nixon. “Just by nature of them living in those communities, caring about those communities, they have a perspective that I don’t think the other candidates have. The reason we wanted to have this forum was to give those candidates a little bit of that perspective.”
The only other candidate in attendance Monday was Steyer, who founded NextGen, a progressive advocacy group. He did not participate in the weekend forum at Benedict College, and is less known for his positions on criminal justice. At the town hall, he showed support for ideas endorsed by many leading candidates, like ending mandatory minimums and making it easier for formerly incarcerated people to find employment. But a moderator pointed out that in 2004, his hedge fund invested heavily in the Corrections Corporation of America, now called CoreCivic, one of the country’s biggest prison companies. Steyer, who says he opposes for-profit incarceration, responded that the investment was a mistake and the hedge fund sold the stock two years later.
The room at the Eastern State Penitentiary, now a museum, was big enough for only about 65 audience members, though there were at least 130 watch parties across 20 states, according to Voters Organized to Educate. Among those in the audience in Philadelphia was Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five, who was wrongly convicted of rape and incarcerated in New York as a teenager, and later exonerated; Reginald Dwayne Betts, a poet and memoirist who was sentenced to nine years in prison as a teen; and chef and best-selling author Jeff Henderson, who served time for a cocaine offense. Organizers said one of their main goals was to help the politicians relate to people with criminal histories on a more personal level.
Though its audience may have been smaller, the town hall was at least one step toward accomplishing that goal. “For the most part,” said Dorsey, “I’m extremely proud and encouraged that a few candidates have shown up and decided to talk with us.” Nixon added, “When you are proximate to people who have experienced the thing you’re trying to legislate about, you are much more likely to make legislation that has a positive impact on those communities.”
Still, some at the watch party were skeptical. Lee “Taqwaa” Bonner, who was released from prison a few years ago after about three decades behind bars, and who’s now a housing advocate with Dorsey’s organization, said that when it comes to politicians, even presidential candidates who hit all the right talking points, he’s cautious: “From what I’ve been observing, they say one thing and do another.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Nyhan’s point is that there’s no particular conservative bias in this list. I’d make a second point: Most of these posts aren’t partisan or political in the first place. Those of us who follow politics as a hobby think that it’s the most important thing in the world, but the rest of the world doesn’t agree. The readership of most political sites is tiny compared to the readership of sports blogs or mommy blogs or gossip blogs.
This is one of the reasons I’m untroubled about Facebook’s decision not to police political advertisements. I’m no fan of Facebook, but that’s mainly because of their dismal record on things like privacy and data portability. When it comes to political influence, however, there’s little reason to think they play an outsize role. On the contrary, their political influence is minuscule compared to Fox News and talk radio and Drudge and the Wall Street Journal editorial page.
We should be concerned about organized foreign influence on Facebook. We should be concerned about Facebook taking an active censorship role. We should be concerned about Facebook allowing third parties to use private information for political purposes. But taking a hands-off approach to political ads?

(Why a state court? Because the Supreme Court ruled a while back that federal courts shouldn’t get involved in partisan gerrymandering cases. State courts, however, still have jurisdiction.)
This is good news since the North Carolina case is something of a destruction test for gerrymandering decisions. The behavior of the North Carolina legislature has been almost literally beyond belief: First they gerrymandered based on racial classifications, and after that was struck down they generated a nearly identical map but carefully made sure race was never mentioned in the legislative record. Even then, though, they were so greedy that they created a map that almost literally made it impossible for Democrats to ever win a majority no matter how the vote went.
If a map like that can’t be overturned, then pretty much no map can ever be overturned. This means that judicial review of gerrymandered maps may be hanging on by only a thread, but at least it’s still hanging on. More here.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Can one of my British readers please explain this? In the US, the requirement of a supermajority vote is generally meaningful thanks to Senate rules or constitutional mandates. But in Britain, anything parliament can do, it can also undo. So what was the point of the original bill mandating a two-thirds vote?

The applications are generally identical except for one thing: the names of the applicants. One has a sterotypically white name (Madison Nash) and the other has a stereotypically black name (LaShonda Greene). Then you check to see how many of the white names get callbacks for interviews compared to the black names. Generally speaking, the white names get called back at a rate 2-4 percentage points higher than the black names.
Today, Brad DeLong calls my attention to a clever new study that tries to tease out exactly what causes this difference.
In other words, the vast majority of hiring managers aren’t using a racial filter. Only a small group, about one-sixth of the total, discriminates against blacks, but that sixth is massively racist: they all but flatly refuse to even interview someone who seems like they might be black.
Brad says he’s surprised by this, but I’m not. My mental model of racism in recent decades is that, in fact, most people aren’t especially racist—or at least they genuinely try not to be. However, there’s a segment of the population—yes, these are Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables”—who are still openly and defiantly racist in all things. All by themselves, their racism is so overwhelming that it’s enough to make a noticeable difference in the overall rate.
Now, one thing to note here is that this method of sussing out racism sets a very low bar. To pass, all you need to do is be willing to interview someone with a stereotypically black name. You don’t have to hire them, just set up an interview. In other words, this experiment doesn’t really suggest that 83 percent of hiring managers aren’t racist in any way, just that they aren’t huge, raging assholes.
That said, I’m prone to believe that this result is a general one. The evidence I’ve seen suggests that most Americans are, at most, very mildly racist these days. However, there’s still a sixth of the country that basically wishes Jim Crow could make a comeback. This in turn means that perhaps one-sixth of the jobs in America are all but completely denied to blacks.
There’s value in knowing this, because it provides some idea of what needs to be addressed most urgently: identifying the stone racists, not providing endless diversity lessons for everyone else. This study is well worth a follow-up to see if its results hold up.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

According to his prepared opening statement, Vindman contacted an NSC lawyer after Gordon Sondland—the GOP megadonor who President Donald Trump appointed as ambassador to the European Union—”emphasized the importance that Ukraine delivers the investigations” into Trump’s political enemies. Two weeks later, according to his testimony, Vindman became so alarmed after listening in to Trump’s infamous phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he once again reported his concerns to an NSC attorney.
As a direct witness to the phone call, Vindman’s testimony will undermine one of Trump’s go-to attacks against the impeachment investigation: that so far, a number of the allegations surrounding the call have been based on second-hand information. And Vindman’s credentials—Iraq War veteran who was awarded the Purple Heart, a Harvard graduate, a respected public servant—will make his case that much more compelling.
So it’s not a surprise that Trump’s defenders are treating Vindman’s emergence as something of a crisis. Still, their attacks on him have been nothing short of stunning. On Monday, Fox News quickly began suggesting that Vindman may be some sort of double-agent for Ukraine. The basis for such an outrageous theory, according to Laura Ingraham, is the fact that Ukrainian officials “sought advice” from him about how to deal with demands from Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer—a detail Ingraham suggested that the New York Times conveniently “buried” in its report on Vindman’s opening statement.
“Here we have a US national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president’s interest, and usually, they spoke in English. Isn’t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?” Ingraham asked.
“You know, some people might call that espionage,” John Yoo, a former Justice Department official under George W. Bush, said.

Brian Kilmeade took the baton Tuesday morning on “Fox and Friends,” emphasizing that Vindman “tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine”:

The smears extended to an ex-lawmaker, with former Republican Rep. Sean Duffy repeatedly questioning whether Vindman prioritized Ukrainian interests over US interests. “We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from,” he told CNN.

Let’s do some simple arithmetic. The season lasts 26 weeks, which means that last year 1.15 horses died per week. This year, 1.0 horses have died per week. So things are getting better. However, a more accurate way to measure this is horse fatalities per 1000 starts, which accounts for how many races are run. Here you go:
Horse fatalities have been dropping for four years in a row and are currently lower than they were in 2010.
I never really got an answer to my question from last year, namely that the supposed record number of deaths at Santa Anita wasn’t a record at all. It wasn’t even just normal. It was actually less than in any year of the past decade. So why the sudden outcry?
This year it appears that the fatality rate is down even further. And maybe that’s not good enough. Maybe it’s still high compared to other tracks:
Nope. Del Mar clearly has a low death rate, but the other three California tracks are all in the same general area.
You can get different results if you use different statistics, but this seems like the simplest and fairest. And what it says is that Santa Anita has been improving over the past five years and is now about average for horse fatalities in California. So why the hue and cry?

Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union brought the case on behalf of Dr. Yashica Robinson, a comprehensive women’s health specialist in Alabama, calling it “a blatantly unconstitutional attack on the fundamental right to abortion.”
“This win is critical to our patients and to health care providers like myself,”  Robinson said in a statement. “The abortion care we provide is essential health care, and these ruthless attacks from anti-abortion politicians have no place in Alabama.”
District court Judge Myron Thompson issued the injunction against the Alabama law, which banned abortion at every stage of pregnancy and criminalized the procedure for providers. The law, which was passed in May 2019, included an exception when the mother’s life was in danger but not for cases of rape and incest. Thompson’s decision came after other courts have already blocked similar abortion bans in Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio.
“Once again, the courts have affirmed that we have a right to access safe, legal abortion,” Alexis McGill Johnson, the acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. “Politicians in Alabama, and across the country, are putting people’s health and lives at risk in their attempts to ban abortion outright in this country,”
The ban, which would have gone into effect on November 15, is just one of many abortion bans passed by state legislatures since the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Although none of these laws have been able to go into effect, Republican-led state legislatures hope that by passing laws that directly contradict Roe v. Wade, they can force the Supreme Court to take up a challenge to Roe and potentially get the landmark 1973 ruling overturned.
However, even national anti-abortion groups are skeptical of this strategy, as I reported earlier this month:
Steve Marshall, the Alabama attorney general, told the New York Times that Thompson’s injunction was “not unexpected” and will not interfere with the state’s main goal: “to advance our case to the US Supreme Court, where we intend to submit evidence that supports our argument that Roe and [the court’s 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey] were wrongly decided and that the Constitution does not prohibit states from protecting unborn children from abortion.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

According to Politico’s Zachary Warmbrodt, it was quite the soirée. Attendees were treated to an open bar, waiters offered trays of snacks, and an a cappella group performed at the end of the night.
Ways and Means chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.) presided over the festivities, which were well-attended by AIG’s corporate leadership. A bipartisan group of lawmakers from Ways and Means and the House Financial Services Committee―the bodies charged with overseeing the banking industry and taxation―attended, as well.
But to many outside of Congress, this wasn’t an anniversary worth celebrating. AIG is particularly infamous for its role in helping trigger the 2008 financial crisis. The federal government ultimately floated AIG $180 billion dollars to rescue it from an impending collapse that could have been even more catastrophic to the wider economy. According to the final report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, the risky derivatives trades that led to AIG’s failure were only possible because of “sweeping deregulation” of those complex financial instruments. The company has since paid back the bailout funding, and in 2017 it convinced regulators to undo a post-recession designation that had subjected it to stricter government oversight. According to Politico, no one mentioned the bailout during the evening.
For progressives waging primary challenges against entrenched House Democrats, Monday’s event was a perfect example of what they see as the inappropriate coziness between centrist incumbents and the corporate interests they are supposed to keep in check.
“A lack of [government] involvement in allowing corporate giants to do what they please, set the rules for themselves, is what led to the [2008] collapse,” Alex Morse, who’s running against Neal, tells me. “A decade later, nothing has changed. There’s an open door policy between members of Congress and executives working at these firms, and it’s a slap in the face to the people affected by the financial crisis.” Neal, it should be noted, recently accepted a $2,500 campaign contribution from AIG’s political action committee.
Rachel Ventura—who is running against Rep. Bill Foster, a Financial Services member who attended the AIG event—described the gathering as “disturbing.” In a statement, she said that Foster’s presence was “not surprising” and called for an ethics investigation into how the party came to be.
For the last several months, progressive challengers have waged their primary battles on multiple fronts. Support for prized liberal initiatives, such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, and promises to curtail corporate influence have been the bedrock of their campaigns. But so was a sharp rebuke of centrist incumbents who did not share progressive activists’ urgency in impeaching President Donald Trump. Morse had hammered Neal over his lack of support for an impeachment inquiry back in July. “I can’t purport to know the congressman’s strategy, but people are angry and scared,” he told me then. “Our democracy is dying right before us, and we need members of Congress that are there to uphold the Constitution.”
But the emergence of a whistleblower complaint alleging Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his political enemies complicated that position. As the details of Trump’s exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emerged, nearly all of those once-reluctant moderates, including Neal, lined up behind House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment investigation. As a result, as HuffPost’s Daniel Maran’s noted, primary challengers lost that point of contrast.
Morse doesn’t think Democrats’ unity on impeachment actually helped matters for Neal. “I wasn’t running because of impeachment,” Morse tells me, reiterating his support for the progressive platform.
But the AIG party give progressives an easily understandable event they can use to illustrate their argument against the Democratic establishment. Morse tells me he’s plans to highlight it on the campaign trail. “This is a very clear example of what’s wrong with Washington,” he says. “Congressman Neal knows how Washington works, and it works when you open up your committee rooms to corporate interests and set the rules against working people and families.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Now the administration is using El Paso to test another secretive policy that will allow it to rapidly deport asylum seekers with negligible due process. And on Tuesday, Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan touted a sharp drop in border crossings at a press conference in, appropriately enough, El Paso.
The number of people taken into custody by Border Patrol agents dropped from 132,856 in May to 40,507 in September. That is mostly because far fewer Central American families are crossing the border now that they know they are unlikely to be quickly released. The number of parents and children traveling together stopped by Border Patrol agents plummeted from 84,486 to 15,824 during that period.
The decrease has happened because the administration has learned a lesson between the two El Paso experiments that have bookended its immigration crackdown. Since the fiasco of family separation, it’s moved toward policies like the new El Paso pilot program that are complex and hidden from public view. The new policy is legally technical and won’t require splitting up families, meaning it is unlikely to generate the same kind of public backlash as the family separation crisis. Its adoption is another sign that the Trump administration concluded from the family separation crisis that deterrence is more sustainable when it is obscured and hard to understand.

The total number of migrants apprehended at the border throughout the 2019 fiscal year, which ended in September, was higher than in any year since 2007. Instead of Mexican men looking for work—the prototypical migrants in recent decades—most of the people stopped at the border were Central American families who readily turned themselves in to Border Patrol agents to start the process of seeking asylum. Of the 851,508 people apprehended by Border Patrol agents this year, 473,682 were traveling with family members—more than four times the previous record set in 2018.
After a year of flailing and being blocked in court, the Trump administration’s border deterrence strategy began to coalesce this summer. The first obstacle migrants now face—secured after Trump threatened to place tariffs on Mexico—is increased Mexican enforcement that happens out of US view. For those who do reach the border, the Remain in Mexico policy now sends them back to dangerous Mexican border cities to await their US court dates. That program that has affected more than 50,000 asylum seekers and likely deterred many thousands more.
In September, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can effectively end asylum at the border while litigation is pending. That is what makes the new “Prompt Asylum Claim Review” policy in El Paso possible. The asylum ban means that people at the border now have to seek protection under forms of relief like the Convention Against Torture that are much harder to obtain than asylum. PACR rushes migrants through hard-to-pass screening interviews that are used to determine whether someone is even eligible to apply for those protections.
CBP Deputy Commissioner Robert Perez said at the El Paso press conference on Tuesday that only a few dozen people have been put through PACR so far. As with family separations, Perez said CBP would look to expand the program along the border after it was tested in El Paso.
CBP did not tell El Paso immigration attorneys about the new program. Taylor Levy, an El Paso immigration lawyer, found out about it earlier this month when an out-of-town attorney contacted her to ask for help representing two sisters in Border Patrol custody. Raquel, one of the sisters, had a six-month-old son with her. Silvia, the other sister, had a one-year-old daughter. They’d been told by border officials that they needed to find an attorney within 48 hours to avoid being deported, Levy said on a call with reporters on Monday.
Against the odds, Raquel found an attorney while she and her son were being held in the frigid and often traumatizing holding facilities known as hieleras, or iceboxes. She was allowed two phone calls during her time in detention. Linda Rivas, the executive director of El Paso’s Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said lawyers have no physical access  to clients in the PACR program. “We have been told that they cannot and will not physically accommodate attorneys,” she said.
Raquel did not meet the higher standard forced by the asylum ban and was deported to El Salvador, where Levy said she immediately sought medical attention for her son. Raquel said in a statement that she felt tricked and humiliated by CBP. “Psychologically I am not well because of all the racism, abuse of power, and humiliation that I received,” she said.
Silvia, her sister, was separated from her husband and had been detained for three weeks when she spoke to reporters on Monday. On Tuesday, I texted Levy to see if there’d been an update. Silvia had also been deported, Levy replied. The fact that lawyers even knew she entered and left the United States will be the exception under the new El Paso program. The Trump administration prefers it that way.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Fernández, already a high school student body president and a courageous leader of Argentina’s movement to legalize abortion, became an internet phenomenon last year with a detailed, authoritative rebuke of a pundit who tried to dismiss her as a chiquita (little girl) on TV.
Fernández, with more than 338,000 Instagram followers, says she represents thousands of young women who took to the streets to legalize women’s right to choose. The effort failed in Argentina’s Senate.

His Campaign Is Doubling Down on the Rich.,Kara Voght,MotherJones,Politics,"On October 20, Joe Biden rode into the well-heeled suburb of Greenwich, Connecticut, to attend a high-dollar fundraiser hosted in his honor by the state’s governor, Ned Lamont. The event was sandwiched between appearances in Manhattan, suburban Westchester County, and a swing through Pennsylvania, where the former vice president headlined another pricey event in advance of a speech in his hometown of Scranton—a speech that made an emotional appeal to the economic plight of the middle class.
The campaign wouldn’t disclose how much money the event at Lamont’s personal mansion raised, but the Hartford Courant reported that 140 attendees had chipped in more than $300,000—meaning at least three-quarters of donors had paid the $2,800 maximum campaign contribution that federal campaign laws allow. The former vice president had arrived from Manhattan by car and departed the same way, with no public or smaller dollar events as part of this trip.
Biden’s been at the top of the national polls since he entered the 2020 fray, but his fundraising numbers haven’t reflected that. From July through September, Biden posted $15.7 million, nearly $2 million less than what he spent during that time. His chief Democratic rivals, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, outraised him last quarter—by $12 million and $9.4 million respectively—while eschewing events like the one Lamont hosted. They are each declining to hold high-dollar fundraisers and are raising money primarily with low-dollar online contributions.
Critics and fans of Biden alike have noticed that his campaign has become overly reliant on exclusive events for the upper-tier of Democratic donors, and have suggested that the former VP might want to gin up some enthusiasm with the middle class voters who can chip in smaller amounts. They say private gatherings with lower price tags or public appearances paired with the opportunity to donate—a ritual of the Sanders and Warren campaigns—could cultivate the demographics and bring in some much-needed cash.
But instead, Biden’s finance team is taking the opposite approach, pushing the campaign to be more reliant on max donations, by setting higher benchmarks for fundraisers that Biden will attend and keeping the candidate away from events with lower ticket prices. Biden supporters in close contact with the campaign told me they have faith in Biden’s tactics, but wouldn’t mind seeing the former vice president take a page or two out of his rivals’ handbook and pair these high-dollar appearances with small-dollar stuff that both pads the coffers and builds grassroots-style rapport with a different swath of the electorate.
A Politico analysis of candidate schedules found that Biden dedicated more than a third of his campaign schedule from April through August to fundraiser appearances, a percentage bested only by California Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Biden’s appearance in Greenwich is one of at least half a dozen high-dollar fundraisers he’s held since the October 15 FEC filing deadline, where plates started at $1,000 and ran up to $2,800—and would-be donors willing to fork over the lower sums were turned away in favor of those who could dish out the max. (The Biden campaign declined to comment on details in this story.)
And Biden finance staffers have encouraged higher thresholds for these big dollar events: In the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, hosts have been asked to hit a goal of $200,000 per event, a floor $50,000 greater than what had been asked in past months. The campaign is rewarding bundlers with titles like “advocate” ($25,000) and “unifier” ($100,000) that come with attendant perks, like calls with campaign leadership and invites to finance committee meetings. And last Thursday, his campaign announced that it would no longer rebuff financial assistance from super-PACs, groups that raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. They tend to rely on massive checks from wealthy donors and offer another outlet for big spenders who have already maxed out in their donations to Biden’s primary fight.
Biden’s two top challengers, Sanders and Warren, have taken an opposite tack. Both have rejected corporate PAC donations, super-PAC help, and high-dollar fundraisers during the primary—and vow to continue doing so if one of them is chosen as the Democratic nominee. They’ve instead spent much of their time on the road, holding rallies and small gatherings that give them face time with supporters, in addition to the occasional in-person contribution—a method that’s also helped them build massive online lists that they can solicit from again. Sanders has held the occasional small-dollar fundraiser, like the one he did in Detroit in advance of the second debate. Both Sanders and Warren publicly criticized Biden for his reversing his position on accepting help from super-PACs.
In the early states, Biden’s public appearances do mirror those of his Democratic rivals, where campaign aides collect contact information and small donations from attendees. Jill Biden, the former vice president’s wife, has held lower-dollar events for her husband in Washington, Florida, Connecticut, and elsewhere, where the cost of attendance has hovered in the two- and three-figure ranges.
But some Biden supporters see the chance to do more events with smaller donors. “I wish we would do more unified events where you have high-dollar, medium-dollar, and low-dollar offerings,” says William Owens, a DNC member from Tennessee who has endorsed Biden. “I’m sure that will come. The campaign’s saying what their priorities are now and I respect that.” Owens held a top-dollar fundraiser at the Nashville City Club in May; hosts put up the maximum $2,800 donations while attendees paid $1,000.
“I believe in small money,” says Charlie Diradour, a Biden backer based in Richmond, Virginia, who’s in frequent contact with the campaign. “I think there’s some unique ways of raising money for those who can do $25, $100, $250. I don’t see what’s wrong with getting someone from the campaign on a phone or an iPad down here to do a presentation with beer and snacks. You don’t need Joe Biden or Dr. Jill Biden in the city to do that.”
Diradour held a fundraiser for Biden in August, where an invitation listed attendance prices ranging from $500 to $15,000. He says the Biden campaign has told him that it will be doing small money events at some point in the future. “I believe going forward, you will see more small money contributions into the Biden campaign,” he says.
Barry Goodman, a DNC member from Michigan and Biden supporter, co-hosted a fundraiser for Biden in Detroit around the second Democratic debate. “At our event, we were charging $1,000 per ticket, and for the maximum donation you got a photo,” he says. But he insisted the campaign offer a lower-priced ticket for attendees under 35, at $250. “I didn’t want just 50- or 60-year-olds. I’m trying to energize millennials who respond well to seeing Joe in person.” Ticket prices at similarly timed Sanders fundraiser in Detroit started at $27.
But none of the Biden boosters Mother Jones spoke with begrudge the campaign’s tactics. “I wish there were no PACs anywhere, anytime, but unfortunately to compete, they’re what you need,” Goodman says. “You have to trust who are running for office that they won’t be beholden to those.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump Organization has been in contact with a real estate advisory firm to discuss the possible sale of the Trump International Hotel and is seeking as much as $500 million. Since it opened shortly before the 2016 election, the hotel has been a magnet for Trump’s conservative allies, as well as lobbyists and foreign officials seeking to curry favor with the president. And it has been a lighting rod for criticism because of the conflict of interest it represents.
In a statement, Eric Trump said that there have been interested buyers since the hotel opened but the Trump Organization is now considering a sale because “people are objecting to us making so much money on the hotel, and therefore we may be willing to sell.”
For one thing, it’s not clear the hotel is making “so much money.” According to Trump’s most recent financial disclosure, the hotel reported revenues of $40.8 million in 2018, but that figure, which doesn’t take into account expenses, does not represent the hotel’s profitability. Trump doesn’t actually own the building the hotel is in; he leases it from the federal government. (Trump would be selling the rights to operate a hotel in the building, which he won in a controversial bidding contest.) The lease requires Trump to pay $3 million a year, plus a percentage of the profits, to the Government Services Administration, the agency that oversees the property. But a GSA official testified to Congress last month that Trump hasn’t ever paid much more than the $3 million, suggesting that the hotel may not be making “so much money.”
In January 2017, just days before taking office, Trump held a press conference at which he explained how he would avoid any conflicts of interest between his businesses and his official duties as president. His solution: place his businesses in a trust that he still controlled and had access to. Ultimately, Trump simply refused to divest himself of any assets or install any formal oversight to prevent him from continuing to manage the business. Instead, he said, he would appoint his two adult sons to run his company and install an “ethics adviser” to help avoid conflicts of interest. At the press conference, Sheri Dillon, one of his attorneys, said selling would be out of the question:
Neither the Trump Organization nor Dillon responded to requests for comment about what has changed since Dillon made that argument.
Steven Schooner, a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in government contracting, said that under the terms of the lease, the GSA does have the ability to nix any transfer of the lease but is unlikely to do so unless there is a very good reason to think the buyer would not able to handle the business.
Trump borrowed $170 million from Germany’s Deutsche Bank to finance the renovation of the old building. Because the building is owned by the government, Trump is both the tenant and, as head of the executive branch, the landlord. It’s a situation that was expressly prohibited in the terms of the lease—inked before Trump took office—which forbade the participation of any elected official in the deal. Officials at the GSA later deemed that this troublesome clause posed no issue.
Trump visits the property regularly—one of the reasons so many GOP figures now flock to the lobby bar on a nightly basis—and has the right under the terms of the trust he set up to take cash from the business at any point. At the 2017 press conference, Trump pledged that he wouldn’t discuss business with his sons. But did they consult him on the sale of his prized DC hotel? The Trump Organization didn’t respond to a request for comment on that point.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The contrast is staggering. On one side of a narrow track is cool, moist rainforest, stretching northwest for hundreds of kilometers through the almost intact Xingu indigenous reserve. On the other side is hot, bare ground being prepared to plant soy on a farm the size of 14 Manhattans. This, says my guide, earth systems scientist Michael Coe, is the front line of deforestation in the Amazon—where the rainforest meets agribusiness, but also where a rainforest ecosystem is being degraded into savanna grassland.
It is also “the perfect laboratory” for exploring how forests interact with climate, and how that changes when the forest disappears, says Coe, of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts. And it is where Brazilian and American scientists are keeping watch for the long-predicted tipping point—the moment when the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest, begins a process of runaway degradation, when so much forest has been lost that the transition to savanna is irreversible. That will be the moment when the Amazon ceases to be a carbon sink that helps protect the planet from climate change, and turns into a global source for carbon emissions.
We are on Tanguro Farm in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, one of the world’s largest soy farms. A 16-hour bus ride from Brasilia, the farm is in the basin of the Xingu River, one of the Amazon River’s largest tributaries. A century ago, when the area was still remote jungle, eccentric British explorer Percy Fawcett disappeared here while searching for the rumored “Lost City of Z,” and where some 100 people died seeking to rescue him.
There may never have been a “lost city.” But the modern-day local town of Canarana is full of grain silos, bars, and John Deere franchises, servicing the big farms. One of the largest, Tanguro, was partly cleared for pasture in the 1980s, and converted to cultivation starting in 2003 by the Amaggi corporation, the world’s largest soy farming conglomerate. Today, half is comprised of fragments of forest; the rest consists of giant fields growing soy, corn, and, starting this year, cotton.
Thanks to a deal struck at a chance meeting between Woods Hole researcher Dan Nepstad and the company’s CEO and then-state governor Blairo Maggi, American researchers and colleagues from the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM) have since 2004 been monitoring the forest and researching how the climate is changing in and around it.
And following the widespread fires set this year on the fringes of the Amazon—breaking a run of 15 years during which deforestation had been dramatically reduced — places such as this are on the front line as the Amazon faces its most fundamental crisis, with temperatures rising, dry seasons lengthening, and rainforest trees being replaced by savanna species.
More than a third of the Xingu Basin, a region bigger than New York State, is now deforested. Scraps of tree cover are all that remain outside the still densely forested Xingu indigenous reserve at its heart. I am shown around by Coe and Divino Silvério, the son of a local farmer, whose research work on the station has garnered him a doctorate and a string of highly regarded scientific papers. “We have over a decade of data here. Nowhere else in the tropics has that,” says Coe.
What they are seeing is alarming.
Deforestation is dramatically raising local temperatures. The air over the farm is on average 5 degrees Celsius hotter than in the forested reserve over the fence: 34 degrees C, rather than 29 degrees C. The difference rises to a staggering 10 degrees at the end of the dry season, says Coe.
And the dry season is lengthening. Across the Xingu Basin and through the southern Amazon region known as the “arc of deforestation,” it lasts almost four weeks longer than half a century ago.
Why these huge changes? The answers lie not in global climate change but in the impact of deforestation, says Coe. In the old days, the trees of the rainforest acted as water pumps, recycling most of the rainwater, which they pumped from underground and released into the atmosphere from the pores in their leaves, a process known as transpiration.
Transpiration requires large amounts of energy, taken from solar radiation. “Every square meter of forest removes the heat equivalent of about two 60-watt [light] bulbs burning 14 hours per day,” Coe calculated in one study. So it cools the air of intact forest. But take away the forest, and the air is instantly much hotter.
The transpiration of a typical large Amazon tree also releases around 500 liters of water a day into the atmosphere. The moisture creates clouds and rain that sustain the forest. Three-quarters of the rain falling in the forested parts of the Xingu Basin is recycled back into the air in this way. But that proportion falls to 50 percent or less if the trees are replaced by pasture or croplands.
The Amazon currently still generates about half its own rainfall, with some rain blowing on the trade winds from the Atlantic Ocean falling and then transpiring back into the air five or six times as it crosses the vast basin. But deforestation has reduced annual moisture recycling in the Xingu Basin by 35 cubic kilometers in the past two decades, according to Silvério.
So deforestation creates what Coe calls “a giant change to the water and energy balance. The climate shifts.” Permanently steamy jungle is replaced by a hotter, drier climate, with dust devils replacing transpiring trees.
The change is especially important at the end of the dry season. Tapping water deep underground, trees keep transpiring even after months without rain. In fact, thanks to the energy from the unrelenting sun, they transpire even more in the dry season than in the wet season. Research at Tanguro has confirmed that this is vital to ending the dry season, because it provides the first moisture for the rains to resume, says Coe.
As the climate changes, so does the vegetation. Rising temperatures and a longer dry season, both caused by the loss of trees, create water stress that flips ecosystems from rainforest to savanna.
A long dry season also makes the forests more susceptible to fires. And fires in turn accelerate the change in vegetation. As Coe puts it: “Fire is nature’s way of starting over.” And now when it starts over here, it shifts to savannah species.
The combination of rising temperatures, longer dry seasons, and more fires is driving the “savannization” of the forests—a process first predicted in 1991 by Brazil’s pre-eminent climate scientist, Carlos Nobre. “When the dry season becomes longer than four months, tropical forest turns to savanna,” he told me when we met in his hometown outside São Paulo after my visit to Tanguro.
For many years this was just a prediction from climate models. But, says Paulo Moutinho, a senior scientist at IPAM and a fellow of Woods Hole, “Our fire studies at Tanguro were the first to test Nobre’s savannization model in the field. We are demonstrating what Nobre predicted—that fire transforms rainforest into savanna through speeding the invasion of cerrado trees.” Silvério has overseen a detailed inventory of thousands of trees in the forested areas of Tanguro Farm. The second census, currently under way, has found a decline in the number of species in just the past four years. Big rainforest trees in particular are being replaced by fast-growing pioneer species, many more widely known in savanna regions.
Experimental plots at Tanguro, in which patches of forest are subjected to burning, show how following the fires, savanna trees and grasses move in to replace the lost rainforest. The grasses in particular are more flammable, so the next fire burns more fiercely than the first.
The managers on Tanguro Farm have been attempting to follow the government’s Forest Code, which requires them to plant native rainforest tree species onto land near rivers that was illegally cleared by the cattle ranchers that preceded them. But the new savanna climate means rainforest saplings won’t grow, says Coe. “Probably savannah species would grow, but the code says you have to restore what was there before.” So instead, the company leaves these riparian areas fenced off in the hope the native species will find a way to return. Nobody is holding their breath.
Nobre argued in 2007 that there could come a point where savannization is unstoppable across large swaths of the Amazon. He said the tipping point could occur if 40 percent of the forest was lost. More recently he has warned that, with the background global rise in temperatures, that threshold could be much closer—at between 20 and 25 percent loss. With Brazilian government scientists putting the current loss at 19.7 percent, the doomsday could be close.
Some leading Brazilian researchers interviewed for this article questioned whether there is a single tipping point that applies to the entire Amazon. It could be a more gradual process. The more pristine north and west could survive. But other regions in the south and east, including Mato Grosso, are well past 25 percent loss. And in Tanguro, accelerating savannization seems to be under way right now.
This matters for the planet as a whole. For, says Jose Marengo, research director of Brazil’s National Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters, switching from rainforest to savanna will change the Amazon from its current position as a sink for about a billion tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide a year, into a CO2 source. “It would mean bye-bye Paris,” he says, referring to the 2015 Paris accord aimed at keeping global warming below 2 degrees.
One researcher told me she believes that the switch has already happened. Her study is not yet completed, but it may produce some headline-grabbing findings next year.
For the Brazilian scientists fighting to save the Amazon, the tragedy is that they are seeing decades of work that established the rainforest’s importance for Brazil and the globe apparently undone in the months since Jair Bolsonaro took office as Brazil’s president in January. He has effectively given a green light for forest clearance. This has put into reverse a decline in deforestation of more than 75 percent since 2004, just after environmental activist Marina Silva became the country’s environment minister. She introduced a moratorium on the sale of beef or soy from recently deforested land and policing the Amazon with real-time satellite monitoring of forest destruction.
Bolsonaro says Brazil cannot allow its economic development to be hampered by foreign-imposed restrictions on clearing forests for agriculture. Baloney, say most of his country’s scientists. Most deforestation is carried out illegally by speculators grabbing state-owned forest land. “They cut and burn the trees. Then they put in cattle, and wait for an amnesty to legalize their annexation, after which they can sell,” says Mountiho.
This is not about economic development, Mountiho says. It is about condoning criminality. Genuine economic development would involve more intensive use of already deforested land. In fact, says Nobre, the country could increase beef and soy production while still giving land back for natural forest regeneration. “If you double up livestock intensity, which is entirely feasible, you could free up more than half a million square kilometers for forest restoration,” he told me.
Such progressive policies are now supported by many large agribusinesses, says Nobre. They fear that continued deforestation could bring international consumer boycotts of their beef, soy, and other products. But it remains unclear if the government will continue to back land speculators or listen to an emerging alliance of environmentalists and agribusiness.
With a tipping point looming, the stakes are immensely high for the Amazon and the planet. The forests and much of their biodiversity could, with the right assistance, still recover. Even the huge soy fields at Tanguro are not as lifeless as might be expected. Tall flightless rhea birds wander around looking for seeds. Tapir tracks and droppings are everywhere. Armadillos burrow in the verges. And I even saw a jaguar saunter down a track just 20 meters from a field waiting to be planted with soy.
But on the road back to Canarana, just a few kilometers from the farm gate, Silvério and I encountered the blackened remains of a native forest. It had been engulfed in flame after a fire set to clear scrub on pasture just a week before spread across the road. Was it deliberate or accidental? Out here on Brazil’s wild frontier, nobody knew—or was saying.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Trump’s attendance, his very first Major League Baseball game since taking office, proved instantly regrettable, as a wave of sustained boos and chants of “lock him up” met his jumbotron introduction.


To be clear, this wasn’t limited to a handful of sections; the booing was overwhelming.

“IMPEACH TRUMP” banners were also seen.


Could Trump make out what was happening? Or had he sufficiently inoculated himself from the chorus of condemnation by seating himself with some of his most sycophantic congressional supporters? Well, here he is, making the face of a man ruminating over how to best exact his revenge on America.

Trump left the game with only one inning to go. But in all, Game 5 proved to be a deeply satisfying, unifying moment for these divisive times. Don’t let the Joe Scarborough’s of the world tell you any differently today.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

During the interview, Mattis “disagreed with the president-elect on every one of the main points that he raised.” That conflict “presaged a fundamental chasm, one that would only widen with time,” Snodgrass wrote.
Holding the Line, due out on Tuesday from Penguin Random House, is, if anything, a story of widening chasms: between Mattis and Trump; between Mattis and the other members of Trump’s Cabinet; and, eventually, between Snodgrass and the boss he revered. A former naval aviator with more than two decades of military experience, Snodgrass was prepared to finally spend extended time with his family in early 2017 when an assistant to Mattis called. Like his boss, Snodgrass was not expecting to land a role in the Trump administration, but by April of that year, he was working out of the Pentagon as Mattis’ speechwriter and eventually his director of communications.
That role provided a front-seat view of how Mattis led the Pentagon through Trump’s turbulent first months in office, when policy changes were issued via tweet, senior staffing roles went unfilled, and American foreign policy, after years of alliance-building in the aftermath of World War II, seemed to be unwinding. All the while, Mattis did his best to keep at bay the controversies of Trump’s Washington, even as it became clear to Snodgrass that the grizzled general would not be long for the job. Snodgrass, too, was on his way out, recalling in the book that his “status on Mattis’ team continued to ebb and flow in sync with Mattis’s relationship to Trump.”
Eventually, a dispute with Mattis’s chief of staff brought Snodgrass’ time in the Pentagon to a close. Now, the publication of Snodgrass’ book, following months of legal wrangling with the Pentagon censors over the manuscript, has cemented his banishment from Mattis’ inner circle. “Mr. Snodgrass was a junior staffer who took notes in some meetings but played no role in decision making,” Mattis’ assistant, Candace Currier, told Politico in a statement. “His choice to write a book reveals an absence of character.”
I spoke by phone with Snodgrass—who maintains obvious respect for Mattis—a day before the scheduled release of his book. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
Mother Jones: At what point did you decide to write a book documenting your experience working for Mattis?
Guy Snodgrass: I settled on writing a book a few months after I had left the office. As I reflected upon the experience I had—and then talking to parents, friends, and family who know [me] well—the resounding theme from almost everyone was: What an incredible experience that I had while serving alongside Secretary Mattis, that I had an opportunity to see and experience and make a difference on things that most people will never really, truly, be aware of.
Wouldn’t it be great to codify that experience and share it, so that in today’s world—where there’s so much disinformation that’s being floated about—[we’d] actually have a firsthand account of what it was really like behind the scenes and what it was really like to serve alongside Secretary Mattis? I decided in late fall 2018 that I would start on the project. Once Secretary Mattis stepped out of office in December 2018, the following month in January—I hadn’t yet then started writing the book—but that’s when I reached out to Mattis to let him know.
MJ: Mattis’ exit was not a huge surprise to you because, as you write in the book, he had been planning to leave for some time. The policy disagreement he had with Trump over the withdrawal of troops from Syria seemed like a pretext for him to leave.
GS: That’s a fair characterization. It was around the summer of 2018 when I was walking toward Mattis’ office. Even when he’s on the phone with world leaders or having a high-level meeting, he tends to have the door to his office open. I popped in and was talking to the scheduler. I was going to ask a few questions about the events we had going on, and she admonished me for being too loud in the hallway. When I asked her what was going on, she said that he was meeting with [then-White House Chief of Staff] General [John] Kelly and that they were discussing exit plans. Mattis had already made the decision, months in advance of his actual departure, to leave the administration, but then Kelly was going to stay on.
MJ: When the book was initially announced, your publisher said that you relied on “meticulous notes” assembled while at the Pentagon. This language was later removed from the book’s description, and your attorney, Mark Zaid, has said that this language was inaccurate. If not “meticulous notes,” what did you rely on while writing the book to support the quotes and other characterizations?
GS: Mark Zaid stated that the publisher asserted that I had relied on “meticulous notes,” and they had put that as part of the book’s announcement. That caused consternation with the Pentagon. What I did was certainly nothing different than what Secretary Mattis and some of these other senior leaders did.
As his communications director and chief speechwriter, I was in a lot of the high-level meetings and decision-making meetings. I’m there mainly making sure that I’m recording his language, recording the way he says things—in many cases, verbatim. Because [in writing] for him—whether it was the next day, the next week, or the next month—being able to use his own words becomes very important.
Part of my job was to ensure that I made his life and his job as easy as possible. The last thing you’d want is to provide him with a speech or a letter to a foreign leader or a strategic document that’s so far from what his voice is or what he had said that he has to take an extraordinary amount of time to correct it. It was absolutely a normal, ongoing part of my job to take those kind of notes. That being said, there’s a difference with professional notes, which are verbatim, sometimes in very sensitive settings. I periodically would destroy those. You put them in a burn bag or you get rid of them.
I also kept my own personal journals, where at the end of a day when I was at home, or on the weekends, I would reflect on these meetings while it was still fresh in my mind. I wanted to make sure I captured it. While I was working for him, while I knew at the time that I was on my way upward and onward in the US Navy, I did in the back of my mind say, “Twenty years from now, this would be a fascinating experience to reflect on what I’ve learned and share with those who come behind me.”
MJ: A key relationship that you emphasize is the partnership between the so-called “adults in the room”—referring to Mattis, Secretary of State Tillerson, and national security adviser HR McMaster. But Mattis seemed to sour on McMaster. You write, “Mattis’ failure to strengthen McMaster’s position diminished one of his most important allies in the White House—and we needed all the friends we could get.” Why do you think Mattis was so frustrated with McMaster, even though they shared many similar views on policy and similar frustrations with Trump?
GS: Even when senior leaders have an overall alignment in their viewpoints, there’s always going to be differences of opinion on the best way to achieve that. When you look at that period of time, HR McMaster—very close to the center of the administration, President Trump—had a very different perspective than those who were located further away in the administration, be it Secretary of State Tillerson or Secretary of Defense Mattis.
McMaster in particular had a strong view that he wanted to be the nexus of information going into and out of the president, but also to help align and coordinate the efforts, which, when you think of it from a wide lens, that makes perfect sense. But for someone like Mattis, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, interacting with someone who is an actively-serving, three-star Army general, that perhaps subconsciously affected their relationship. Case in point: When HR would talk to Mattis, he would always call him, “Secretary Mattis.” But when Mattis would speak to HR, he called him by his initials, “H.R.”
Mattis and Tillerson felt that McMaster had a heavy hand at the National Security Council, and so they were fighting against that. Sometimes, in the heat of that battle, you lose sight of the bigger picture.
MJ: Tillerson is one recently-departed Trump administration official who has come out and criticized the president quite harshly since leaving the State Department. Why do you think Mattis is so reluctant to speak frankly about his time in the Trump administration? He obviously sees no problem criticizing previous presidents. Why not this one, who he clearly has so much to say about privately? Why not publicly?
GS: There are a few reasons. If you’re Mattis, you spent four decades of time in uniform as a Marine Corps officer. I think that he feels very strongly about the loyalty you owe to your boss, and in this case, I believe he feels very strongly about the loyalty he has to Donald Trump.
You would have to ask Mattis specifically. I know he has stated various reasons for this, but I think that he feels he owes the president his loyalty.
MJ: Your book contains many examples of Mattis’ compassion and professionalism. A quote from him adorns the jacket of your book. Does it bother you to see him dismiss the book so harshly? His aide said, in so many words, that you surrendered you honor by writing this book.
GS: I’m disappointed. I’m disappointed by that statement for a number of reasons. James Mattis does not have the ability to define my character, define my integrity, or define my honor. That’s something I personally get to do. Frankly, we all do it because actions speak louder than words ever can.
If you think about where we are as a society right now, it’s such a highly polarized environment. There’s a lot of misinformation. I don’t believe taking a first-hand account and sharing that with the American public in the interest of openness and transparency is a bad thing. I think Americans need that in order to make informed decisions about the future of our nation.
He has already admitted that he hasn’t read the book, he doesn’t intend to read the book. But he’s willing to pass judgment without knowing what it’s in it. That was the part that was probably most disheartening to me.
MJ: You helped write the Trump administration’s National Defense Strategy, which orients our national security posture away from the Middle East and toward near-peer rivals like China and Russia. In the past months, with Iran and Syria dominating headlines, we’ve seen an increasingly significant focus on the Middle East. Does this indicate something wrong with the Pentagon’s strategy or with Trump’s approach?
GS: What this represents is the lack of a national strategy. You can publish a national security strategy and you can publish a national defense strategy, but those strategies are a hallucination if you don’t take the actions required to put them into place and fully enact them. That’s what you’re seeing right now. It’s one of the reasons I feel so passionate about this project. It’s incredibly dangerous for America’s national security to have a chaotic administration or a chaotic administrative environment.
It’s not like there’s a well-thought-out strategy that’s simply being enacted as we go along. This is just reacting to the news of the day, it’s issuing policy decisions via tweet that catch the State Department, the Department of Defense, other large organizations completely off-balance. When you behave in that way, you undercut your own administration’s ability to accomplish the mission and to accomplish the strategy, but you also endanger America’s position on the world stage.
Just as we’ve seen in the last few weeks with our spur-of-the-moment announcement that we’re leaving Syria, the frantic military movement to make that happen, and suddenly now we’re going to stick in and protect the oilfields. And as I read in the news today and yesterday, we are going to push more troops back into Syria. It’s all over the map.
If I’m China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, I’m giddy with excitement at what I’m seeing from America now because we’re disjointed. We are distracted with a lot of internal power dynamics, politics struggles. We’re inward, as opposed to looking outward, which is going to damage us for decades to come.
MJ: Early in the book you write, “I could think of no other military officer more universally respected by members of the armed services than Mattis was.” That was the view then. Do you still share that opinion of Mattis now?
GS: Largely, I do. There are a small handful of names, whether it’s because of their own battlefield prowess or their intellectual capability. Two that certainly jump to mind who have been on the public stage recently are Navy Admiral James Stavridis, who is fairly active in the media space, and then, of course, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. But I think, as I relay in the book, he’s a person like the rest of us.
He just happens to be an incredibly dedicated public servant and someone who has mastered the ability to have self-discipline that still amazes me to this day. He could be laser-focused on the task at hand and he would focus on that. As we look back on his time in office, of course, he deserves to be scrutinized. We all do. I believe professionals invite scrutiny. And I don’t think he’ll ever shy away from that fact. Whether you’re left-leaning, right-leaning, or right down the middle and fairly apolitical, I think all of us can look at the service he provided and be very appreciative of what he did for the nation.
MJ: Mattis had three main goals as defense secretary: increasing lethality and readiness, strengthening partnerships and alliances, and reforming the Pentagon’s business practices. How successful do you think he and the department have been at implementing them?
GS: The grade would be poor. I would not lay that at Mattis’ feet, nor would I lay it at the feet of the men and women of the department, per se. You can have the best intentions in the world, but if you don’t have the support of the administration, if you don’t have the environment in which you can actually enact those, you’ll find that the best-laid plans are just that.
It goes down to that famous quote that “plans are worthless but planning is indispensable.” We did a lot of planning, and we created a strategy. We restored a budget. We had grand designs to audit the entire department, but within that audit, we had looked for about $120 billion worth of savings over five years. By the time I was walking out the door, then-Deputy Secretary [Patrick] Shanahan was hoping to get something just on the order of $10-20 billion of savings over five years.
We’re in significant danger of letting the needs of the immediate day-to-day overtake our strategic capabilities. That’s so dangerous, not just for the military, but for America and for our national security.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Let’s say the House of Representatives draws up and passes articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Per the Constitution, Chief Justice John Roberts would preside over Trump’s trial in the Senate. Now, imagine Roberts—a George W. Bush appointee—recusing himself from the trial because he once publicly emphasized judges’ responsibility to act in a non-partisan manner.
That’s how influential Trump supporter and radio host John Cardillo would have it, the conservative Washington Times reported Sunday. Cardillo claims that a statement made by Roberts in November 2018—in response to Trump’s criticism of a federal judge—means that he is biased against the president.
“We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” Roberts wrote last year in a statement released by the court’s public information office. “What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”
For Cardillo, these comments are apparently disqualifying. “There is already a crisis of confidence among the American people that we have a fair system of justice,” he said, according to the Times. “When you have a chief justice of the Supreme Court overtly making comments that are derogatory to the president of the United States, take all speculation out of the process.”
The framing of the article suggests the Times is taking Cardillo’s argument seriously, though the story does make clear that constitutional law experts roundly reject Cardillo’s reasoning. Orin Kerr, a scholar at UC Berkeley, called the argument for recusal “weak” and “hard to square” with the Constitution.

In the unlikely event that Roberts did decide to recuse himself, the most senior justice would step in, according to one expert cited by the Times. That’s Clarence Thomas, the most conservative member of the court.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Wade?,Jessica Washington,MotherJones,Politics,"A hearing this week will determine the fate of Missouri’s only remaining abortion clinic—and whether Missouri will become the first state in the country not to have a single abortion clinic since Roe v. Wade.
At the conclusion of the week-long hearing, which began Monday, a state commissioner will decide whether Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region will be able to keep its license to provide abortions. It is the latest hurdle in the abortion clinic’s months-long fight against the state government.
Over the summer, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services demanded to question clinic doctors over claims that the clinic had “potential deficient practices.” The clinic denied the state’s request to interview the doctors, claiming that the forced interviews were a form of harassment and intimidation because the constantly changing enforcement of regulations ensured that providers never knew when they were violating the state’s protocols and could be subject to civil or even criminal penalties following these interrogations. As a result, the health department declined to renew the clinic’s license, leading Planned Parenthood to sue. Planned Parenthood argued that the state had “weaponized the licensing process.”
As I reported in June, the uncertainty surrounding the clinic has taken a toll on both abortion providers and clinic patients. Dr. Colleen McNicholas, one of the doctors at the clinic, told me that the state’s 72-hour waiting period between an initial visit and an abortion has left patients in limbo, unsure if the clinic will still be operating when they come back for their second appointment.
The hearing is taking place before Missouri’s Administrative Hearing Commission. A single commissioner will determine whether the St. Louis Planned Parenthood will be able to keep its license to perform abortions. The hearing is set to conclude on Friday afternoon. According to NPR, the commissioner will hear the state health department’s case against the clinic during the first part of the week and Planned Parenthood’s response during the second half.
While the fate of Missouri’s final abortion clinic remains in the balance, states like Illinois are stepping up their efforts to protect reproductive rights and serve patients from neighboring Missouri. In June, Illinois passed the Reproductive Health Act, which recognizes the right to reproductive health care, including abortion, contraception, sterilization, pregnancy and maternity care. The law also states that “a fertilized, egg, embryo or fetus does not have independent rights.” Illinois Planned Parenthood has announced the opening of a new 18,000-square-foot mega-clinic in Fairview Heights, a mere 15 miles from the Missouri border, which it hopes will be able to provide Missouri residents with care regardless of the outcome of this week’s hearing.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

How Can She Fight Back?,Madison Pauly,MotherJones,Politics,"On Sunday, Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.), announced she was stepping down, putting an end to a recently launched House Ethics Committee investigation into her alleged affair with a male aide. But her resignation won’t stop the spread of nude photos of Hill, published by the right-wing news site RedState and the British tabloid the Daily Mail, some of which also picture a female campaign staffer with whom Hill has admitted a consensual but “inappropriate” relationship.
Hill has blamed the distribution of these private photos on her estranged husband, Kenny Heslep, and on “hateful political operatives” enabling “a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation.” “The fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,” she said in a statement to the Washington Post last week. In her resignation letter, Hill emphasized that she is pursuing all available legal options. “Having private photos of personal moments weaponized against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy,” she wrote. “It’s also illegal.”

Hill’s efforts to seek recourse in the courts could go several ways. Depending on the circumstances under which the photos were published, their distributors could be criminally charged with harassment, stalking, extortion, or identity theft, according to Mary Anne Franks, a University of Miami School of Law professor and the president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit that assists victims of nonconsensual pornography, commonly known as revenge porn. The dissemination of Hill’s photos also likely fall under laws banning revenge porn, Franks says.
The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative’s definition of nonconsensual pornography—the distribution of sexually graphic images of individuals without their consent—clearly fits the photos published on RedState and the Daily Mail. The group estimates that 1 in 8 social media users have been targets of nonconsensual pornography, and that women are 1.7 times more likely to be targeted than men. “It’s a privacy issue, and it’s a women’s rights issue, and it’s a progressive issue,” Franks says.
According to Franks, most states allow victims to file civil lawsuits over the distribution of nonconsensual porn, and all but four—Massachusetts, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Wyoming—have laws criminalizing it. But the laws vary significantly by location. In Washington, DC, where Capitol Police are investigating the distribution of the images of Hill, it is a crime to disclose private, sexual images of people without their consent, but only if it’s done for financial gain or with the intent of harming the persons depicted. In this regard, the law treats revenge porn differently than other kinds of privacy violations, Franks explains. “When we say that you can’t distribute people’s Social Security numbers or medical records without consent, we don’t usually say you can do it so long as you’re not trying to hurt their feelings,” she says.
The requirement to prove intent could come into play if Hill tries to go after RedState for publishing revenge porn. “RedState is probably going to say, ‘Oh hey, we are doing it because we’re trying to report on a newsworthy story,'” Franks says. (The author of the RedState article that included images of Hill argued that “the public should know about” her affairs “as they determine that elected official’s fitness to serve.”) Revenge porn laws in the United Kingdom have similar requirements, potentially complicating any legal case against the Daily Mail. “Unfortunately, as soon as we’re talking about naked photos,” Franks says, “so many of the states and also the UK write laws that say you have to intend to harass or to distress the victim.”
Hill might have more luck in California, whose anti-revenge porn law (the first of its kind, passed in 2013) does not require prosecutors to prove intent to cause harm. “Under California law, the only requirement is that you know or you should have known that it would cause a person intense distress. That shouldn’t be a difficult thing to show, because publishing someone’s incredibly intimate photos is likely to cause distress,” Franks says. “A reasonable person would know that.”
But that doesn’t mean it’s easy to get law enforcement to go after people who post revenge porn. While a public figure or politician should have no problem getting police to take their allegations seriously, Franks says it can be difficult to convince cops that revenge porn—typically a misdemeanor—is a serious crime. “It’s not the kind of thing, when you’re talking about just your average victim, that a police officer’s particularly inclined to pursue,” Franks says. “And beyond that, not particularly something that a prosecutor may be inclined to really be aggressive about.”
These are the kinds of systemic problems that Hill has signaled she will tackle as she plans her next move. “Now my fight is going to be to defeat this type of exploitation that so many women are victims to,” she wrote in her resignation letter, “and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office or entering public light.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In a letter addressed “Dear Democratic Colleague,” Pelosi reiterated that the Constitution does not require the House to hold a vote before beginning an impeachment investigation—and noted that a federal court recently agreed with that fact. “Just last week, a federal court confirmed that the House is not required to hold a vote and that imposing such a requirement would be ‘an impermissible intrusion on the House’s constitutional authority,'” she writes. “The Trump Administration has made up this argument—apparently out of whole cloth—in order to justify its unprecedented cover-up, withhold key documents from multiple federal agencies, prevent critical witnesses from cooperating, and defy duly authorized subpoenas.”
“This week, we will bring a resolution to the Floor that affirms the ongoing, existing investigation that is currently being conducted by our committees as part of this impeachment inquiry, including all requests for documents, subpoenas for records and testimony, and any other investigative steps previously taken or to be taken as part of this investigation,” the letter continues. This step will undercut Republicans’ argument and “eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.”

The ruling comes in response to a lawsuit brought by Eric Holder’s group seeking to end gerrymandering. The group challenged maps the Republican state legislature had drawn in 2016, arguing that it was an illegal partisan gerrymander.
The judges did not set a deadline for the new maps, but the state will have to rush to implement new district lines before next year’s elections.


While the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that partisan gerrymandering is not unconstitutional, state constitutions can still prohibit the practice. There was ample evidence of a politically motivated gerrymander by North Carolina Republicans, the judges found. The papers of the late Thomas Hofeller—a leading GOP redistricting expert who helped draw North Carolina’s map—created a “detailed record of both the partisan intent and the intended partisan effects of the 2016 congressional districts.” (Hofeller’s estranged daughter provided the documents after his death.)

Earlier this year, the same panel of judges threw out the maps the North Carolina General Assembly drew to elect state legislators. The panel approved new state-level maps. The judicial order for new 2020 maps for Congressional seats “respectfully urges” legislators to create “new legislative districts in a short amount of time in a transparent and bipartisan manner.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Climate change has helped wildfires spread far and wide and lengthened the season for burning, something PG&E already knows well. Earlier this year, after the damages of the Camp Fire, PG&E filed for bankruptcy, a move the Wall Street Journal called “the first major corporate casualty of climate change.” The Journal noted: “PG&E has long accepted the science of climate change. It is one of several California utilities that, with prodding from state politicians, has been rapidly shifting to a cleaner energy future.”
PG&E draws far more of its power from renewable energy sources such as hydro, and nuclear than its coal-reliant counterparts. But the utility played a part in propping up climate change denial in the early, pivotal days when the public first learned of the threat. PG&E helped to sow confusion around climate change as an early member of the Global Climate Coalition, which led the successful campaign to stall regulation of greenhouse gas pollution.
Working from 1989 to 2002, the Global Climate Coalition represented coal, oil, automakers, manufacturers, and utilities that all had a stake in maintaining the status quo. A year before the coalition formed, climate scientist James Hansen raised the alarm in testimony to Congress that heat-trapping pollution released by burning fossil fuels was warming the planet. The coalition promoted a small group of scientists whose work helped to plant just enough doubt to justify delay in action to reduce pollution.
The coalition’s members also testified about the supposed uncertainty of global warming before Congress. During the years PG&E was listed as a member, National Association of Manufacturers’ Jerry Jasinowski testified, “There’s nothing in here that leads us to conclude, our scientists nor myself, that there is sufficient evidence to be certain about the benefits of reducing carbon dioxide in a satisfactory way.” In 1991, the Global Climate Coalition submitted a statement called “A Reasoned Approach To Global Warming” that put it even more bluntly: “There is still substantial uncertainty about the very existence of human-induced global warming.”
According to documents collected by the Climate Investigations Center, PG&E was a member of the coalition in 1989, 1990, and 1991. After that, PG&E appears to have split from the group.
Yet by then utility companies were already aware that the carbon pollution they unleashed by burning coal was heating up the planet. The utility watchdog Energy and Policy Institute traced the sector’s awareness of climate change back to at least 1968, according to its report from 2017:
The broader utility sector’s work in promoting skepticism around climate change continued, often through the trade group Edison Electric Institute that represents investor-owned utilities. (PG&E is still a member). Edison Electric Institute’s work today is far more subtle than the early days. In this 1991 ad, for example, it compared concern over warming to “Chicken Little’s hysteria.” This past year, Edison Electric Institute lobbied California on PG&E’s behalf, claiming that it is the state’s responsibility (not the utility’s) to prevent “a future in which electric service is subject to frequent interruption during wildfire season (which may become nearly year-round with climate change).”
PG&E has long since acknowledged the reality of climate change, and is one of the most aggressively invested utilities in renewable energy in the country. Meanwhile, courts are still deciding whether companies might be held legally and financially responsible if they burned fossil fuels despite knowing the risks.
“Major utilities companies, like oil and gas and coal, were on notice about the risk of fossil fuel combustion for decades,” says Caroll Muffett, the president of the Center for International Environmental Law. “If these companies were aware of the risks of those activities, that history becomes a relevant legal part of their future.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Todd Bentley stepped onto his porch and saw the storm swelling the creek near his home. If this kept up all night, he feared, the creek could overflow its banks and wash out his neighborhood’s road. He headed out into the rain with his teenage son to secure his mother’s trailer across the street.
In minutes—before they could finish—they were up to their waists in floodwater. They had to clamber into the hills to escape. There they crouched for hours in their family cemetery, lightning striking around them, the water below them carrying cars, ripping up pavement and lifting homes off foundations.
“He started crying on me, it was happening so fast, and I, literally, I shook him,” Bentley recalled. “I said, ‘Son, listen. We’re fighting for our lives now—you’ve got to keep it together.’”
Nine years after they survived the flood, storms fill Bentley with dread. He watches the creek. He paces.
What if it happens again?
Flash floods have troubled Kentucky for decades. Now, extreme rainstorms are worsening with climate change, increasing the odds of more disasters like the one Bentley’s community endured. For Kentucky’s poorest residents, the people living in flood-prone hollows with surface mines nearby, that means an ever-present threat to both life and hard-won possessions.
But the state isn’t on the front lines of the fight against global warming. Its leaders, concerned about the impact on coal, have positioned themselves on the other side of that battle.
That’s created a dangerous and expensive disconnect—and not just in Kentucky, a Center for Public Integrity analysis shows.
Nine of the 10 states that emit the most heat-trapping carbon dioxide pollution per person helped block the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which would have been the largest effort by the U.S. government to limit climate change. Four of those states, including Kentucky, were among those most often hit by disasters in the past 10 years—generally powerful storms, which science shows are worsening as the planet warms.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it sent nearly $2 billion in taxpayer aid to those four states over the same period to clean up and prepare for future hits. That accounts for two of FEMA’s major programs, just part of the disaster aid flowing to states.
Kentucky alone received more than $530 million from 2009 to 2018. Severe storms and floods accounted for most of its 16 federally declared major disasters. Half of those battered Pike County, home to a quarter of the state’s active coal mines in 2018 and to Bentley’s neighborhood.
The choices that state leaders make now will have life-changing consequences for generations, experts warn. Michael Hendryx, a public health professor at Indiana University Bloomington who studies environmental justice, said he wonders whether officials promoting inaction truly think global warming is not an emergency or are simply making a cynical bet that they won’t be harmed.
“They’ll be the people who have the money and power to defend themselves as climate change gets worse,” he said. “If we don’t do something really powerful and really meaningful soon, then the people who live in vulnerable areas … will suffer the most.”
In some parts of Kentucky, residents say they believe the state’s treatment of coal has increased the risk of disasters in yet another way. Consider the Harless Creek flood that threatened Bentley’s life. Water rushing down the hills from mines—including one the state had allowed to operate on an expired permit—intensified damage from the pounding rain, according to an engineering study prepared for a lawsuit. Afterward, the state cited two companies for violating laws intended to protect people living nearby.
The Kentucky governor’s office didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. John Mura, a spokesman for the state’s mine regulator, the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, wrote in an email that the agency concluded the mines above Harless Creek did not contribute to flood damage. But both the agency and the companies settled lawsuits filed by people living along the creek.
The state now has a system in place to prevent companies from mining with expired permits, Mura wrote.
“The Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet has worked with mining companies to increase safety practices while it has been extremely diligent in holding permit holders accountable to their permit obligations,” he wrote.
Harless Creek was one of at least three cases in Kentucky in which engineering studies found that inappropriately operated or cleaned-up mines worsened flood damage, said Jack Spadaro, a former federal mine regulator who served as an expert witness for plaintiffs in lawsuits about those incidents. The floods collectively killed at least one person and destroyed the homes or belongings of more than 250 residents, according to news reports.
But the problem is far more widespread than just those three cases, Spadaro said. And the areas around mines tend to be poor, making recovery much harder for the people living there.
“When they lose their house,” he said, “they lose everything.”
In September, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin stepped up to the lectern in a historic downtown Louisville hotel to deliver the keynote speech at an energy conference for leaders from southern states.
Days before, dozens of countries and businesses committed to swift action to stem the climate crisis by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Demonstrators turned out in cities around the world, including Louisville, to demand that elected officials do better. But at the Louisville conference, sponsored by oil, gas, coal and electric-utility interests, speakers suggested that the causes of global warming are uncertain. Bevin called people pushing for climate action irrational. His message: Leave fossil fuels alone.
“We are prematurely abandoning our [fossil fuel] assets for what I feel—and I think it’s probably shared by others—may be misguided reasons,” said Bevin, a Republican whose state is the country’s fifth-largest coal producer.
In fact, the science is clear: What’s happening to the planet is different from the natural variability of past eras, when Earth gradually warmed and cooled as its orbit shifted. The world has never in recorded history been so warm, or warmed this fast, U.S. and international research shows. Most of that change occurred in the past 35 years, triggered by decades of heat-trapping, man-made emissions, the federal government says. Burning fossil fuels such as coal is the primary cause, according to decades of scientific studies.
Kentucky’s lung-damaging sulfate pollution, pumped out by sources such as coal power plants, used to partially shield the state from warming because the particles reflected sunlight into space. Those emissions have plummeted. For two decades now, temperatures in the state have risen.
Scientists say the consequences include more heavy downpours. Kentucky storms dumping at least 2 inches of rain over a 24-hour period—storms that pose a flood risk—have increased 20 percent since the early 20th century, said Kenneth Kunkel, lead scientist for technical support for the federal government’s National Climate Assessment.
“We see very strong evidence for extreme rainfall increases across the eastern U.S.,” he said.
Kentucky disasters often hurt poorer areas. For example, more than half the counties hit by federally declared major disasters from 2009 to 2018 had larger shares of households receiving federal food aid than the state overall.
That’s a common problem nationwide, one the federal disaster relief system doesn’t effectively address, said Craig Fugate, a former FEMA administrator. Congress didn’t set up FEMA to account for inequalities that precede disasters, such as homelessness and poverty, he said.
“The system was built for the middle income,” Fugate said. “If you’re poor, the system is not designed to make you whole.”
In Kentucky, Bevin’s administration is basing its preparations for disasters on climate science, even as he casts doubt on it. A 2018 state flood risk assessment, citing a 2017 federal study about climate effects in the region, warns that flooding events are likely to become more frequent and severe.
At the same time, the state continues to push for the status quo on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. In September, Bevin intervened in court to support the Trump administration’s “pro-coal” replacement to Obama’s climate rule—a substitute that projections by the independent research group Resources for the Future suggest would reduce U.S. climate-warming emissions just one-tenth of a percent by 2050.
Bevin is up for re-election Nov. 5. His opponent, Democrat Andy Beshear, acknowledges climate change is happening but also pushed for the demise of the Clean Power Plan — a rule put in place by the Obama administration—and has supported its replacement.
Planning for climate-worsened disasters, as Kentucky is doing, can save money and lives. Flooding is already the state’s “most frequent and costly natural hazard,” killing 41 people over a recent 11-year period and causing an average of $40 million in annual losses, according to the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management.
But simply planning won’t be enough, experts caution.
It will be impossible to protect people and infrastructure from climate change in the long term without also reining in—what scientists call mitigating—heat-trapping emissions, said Lynne Carter, a Louisiana State University adjunct professor.
“Right now, we’re … incrementally coping. We’re not even coping very well,” said Carter, a co-author of the most recent National Climate Assessment, released by the Trump administration. “If we don’t do any mitigation, the problem is going to just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger.”
Kentucky isn’t the only state preparing for the very climate disasters its policies help fuel.
West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat-turned-Republican, leads a state that emits more carbon dioxide per person than all but two others; he says he doubts the science that man-made fossil fuel emissions are warming the planet.
Meanwhile, his emergency managers are planning for a future of more rain and landslides triggered by climate change.
In Nebraska, the state with the ninth-highest carbon dioxide emissions per person, Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts’ administration has questioned whether climate science is settled while relying on a hazard mitigation plan calling climate change “an increasingly important factor” in local risks.
Like the Kentucky governor’s office, Bevin’s campaign spokespeople did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesman for Beshear, Bevin’s challenger and Kentucky’s attorney general, wrote in an email that all energy sources are needed to address the planet’s warming—he did not say how that would lower greenhouse gases—and the right strategy would provide jobs for Kentuckians.
“Mining plays an important role supporting Eastern and Western Kentucky families,” Sam Newton, the Beshear campaign spokesman, wrote in an email. “Andy is on Team Kentucky, which means he’ll fight policies that hurt Kentucky families and work with anyone to help Kentucky families.”
The offices of the West Virginia and Nebraska governors didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.
There’s a cost to ignoring climate science. U.S. taxpayers already have begun paying it.
Seven states—all of which opposed the climate-focused Clean Power Plan—account for more than a third of FEMA spending to help communities rebuild after and adapt for natural disasters in the past 10 years, according to figures from the agency. Those states, including Texas and Florida, received $21 billion between them.
Small and seemingly benign, Harless Creek meanders beside a road that shares its name. Homes sit nearby between two mountains—Todd Bentley’s among them.
On a sunny day in June, his family gathered at his mother’s hair salon, a white-paneled house with a wooden porch that overlooks the creek.
Around a coffee table cluttered with newspaper clippings and photos of the flood, they remembered Bentley’s grandmother escaping up the mountain that night in 2010 in her pajamas, a quilt over her head. His mother, Janie Caudill, racing back from Tennessee, stopping only to pick up rubber boots. Residents shining flashlights across the creek to signal that they were alive.
The next day, Caudill’s uncle, Bill Blackburn, stopped by on the way to his house. He lived in the hollow and also hadn’t been there during the storm.
“He said, ‘Well, I’ve got to go home … I’ve got the keys right here in my pocket,’” Caudill remembered. “We didn’t have the heart to tell him that he didn’t have a door there to unlock.”
Pike County has a history of flash floods. Officials here cut a mountain in two in the 1970s so they could reroute the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River to avoid flooding, a $78 million operation that was one of the largest land movements in the Western hemisphere. But Harless Creek took everyone aback.
Seven inches of rain fell between 4 p.m. July 17, 2010, and 1 a.m. the next day. By 8:40 p.m., Harless Creek was over its banks, transforming into a torrent. The floodwaters damaged, destroyed and in some cases carried off more than 100 people’s property: homes, vehicles, sheds. In a county where nearly 30 percent of residents live in poverty, it represented an especially heavy loss.
The amount of rain the storm dumped was brutal, but Bentley and other residents suspected that nearby coal mines played a significant role in the flood. They hired lawyer Ned Pillersdorf, who asked an engineering firm to investigate.
The firm’s findings: The operations of two companies’ mines in the mountains above the neighborhood increased the size and speed of the flood. That’s because unstable dirt and rock surfaces exposed through mining sent more water downhill instead of absorbing it, Spadaro said. Forty-four percent more water rushed into the area, the firm concluded, increasing the “destructive energy of the flood waters.”
On behalf of the people with property damage, Pillersdorf sued both mines’ owners, Cambrian Coal and AEP Kentucky Coal. The businesses’ failure to follow mining rules worsened the flood and residents’ losses from the incident, he alleged in the lawsuit. The companies settled over the next two years, the amounts confidential.
Then Pillersdorf went after the party Bentley’s family thinks ultimately is at fault: the state of Kentucky.
First he sued the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, alleging the agency didn’t properly enforce mining rules — endangering residents—and demanding the state do its job. In 2014, the agency agreed to a confidential settlement and brought in federal investigators to ensure the mines complied with the law.
He later filed another claim against the state. Harless Creek residents requested payment from Kentucky’s claims board, asserting that the energy cabinet’s negligence increased their flood losses, but the cabinet argued that these claims were filed too late. An appellate court recently agreed with the state. The Kentucky Supreme Court is considering whether to review the decision.
Sitting inside his first-floor office in Prestonsburg, west of Pike County, Pillersdorf said it doesn’t surprise locals that companies would ignore mining rules to save money.
“What they don’t understand is, why is the state so damn indifferent to how dangerous these ticking time-bombs are?” he said.
After the storm, the state issued citations to Cambrian Coal for violations that included mining without a permit, inappropriate cleanup and poorly designed and operated sediment ponds, which are intended to capture soil moved during operations. The penalty, after Cambrian Coal appealed, was eventually set at about $50,000. The state cited AEP Kentucky Coal for improper conditions that led to mudslides, fining the company $400.
U.S. taxpayers paid more than five times those combined penalties—almost $300,000—just to rebuild Harless Creek Road, according to federal data obtained by Public Integrity.
AEP Kentucky Coal maintains it didn’t contribute to the flood. The state mine regulator’s spokesman agreed. The residents’ engineering firm did not. While the company settled, it did not admit liability and only “participated in the settlement to promote a prompt conclusion to the case,” AEP spokeswoman Melissa McHenry wrote in an email.
Listen to a radio version of this story here:

Cambrian Coal didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. Neither did Booth Energy, which previously owned the company.
Bentley’s family has far more complicated feelings about the mine owners than about the state’s handling of the situation.
Bentley’s son, Tyler, now 24, is a coal miner. So were Bentley’s father and grandfather, and Bentley himself, before an accident on the job in 2002 left him unable to work. Judi Casalino, his aunt, used to be a sales executive for a coal company.
“It’s hard for me,” she said. “I know that coal mining had a whole lot to do with what happened up here,” but she couldn’t help but also think of Cambrian Coal’s economic impact.
She pointed to Jim Booth, who’d long run the company: “That one man employs 500-something people right now in eastern Kentucky, so let’s give him credit where credit’s due. If he weren’t in the business, it’d be a whole lot of people would have no jobs.”
Just days before, though Casalino didn’t know it, Booth had resigned as a director and shareholder at the company. Shortly afterward, Cambrian Coal and related businesses filed for bankruptcy protection. As of early October, the company owed local governments and schools more than $1 million in unpaid taxes, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.
Today, the mines that settled with neighbors over the flood have been cleaned up, according to the state. But people here remain shaken.
One neighbor sleeps in her clothes every night “because she’s afraid she might have to get out,” Caudill said, while Bentley, his stepfather and his son “get really paranoid” if there’s a storm brewing. Some people are gone: They couldn’t bear to live here after the flood.
And Blackburn, the uncle who didn’t have the door to lock? Two years afterward, he was dead.
“He grieved himself to death,” Caudill said. “He just couldn’t deal with what he’d lost.”
Five days after Cambrian Coal settled the lawsuit brought by Harless Creek residents, then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., delivered a tribute on the Senate floor to a fellow Kentuckian — Cambrian’s then-owner, Booth.
Booth is a “treasured citizen,” “someone who has taken it upon himself to make an investment in the betterment of his community, county and state,” McConnell said. “Booth’s story is one of success in the free market, and a testimony to what can happen when a small business is given room to take root and grow.”
What prompted this 2012 outpouring by McConnell, one of the most powerful men in Washington, isn’t clear.
But Booth, named by the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting in 2014 as one of “Kentucky’s top 10 ‘power players,’” is a reliable political donor who has supported many of the state’s key officials, including McConnell, Bevin and Beshear, the attorney general.
Bevin tried to unseat McConnell in the 2014 Republican primary, and Beshear—a Democrat—is running against Bevin in the governor’s race this year. But when it comes to coal, they’re on the same page.
Beshear took over his predecessor’s legal fight to block the Clean Power Plan. McConnell marshaled states across the country to resist the rule, and this year — five weeks after acknowledging that human activities are changing the climate—declined to bring up for a vote a bill to keep the U.S. from pulling out of the international agreement to slow global warming. Bevin tapped a former coal executive to head the state’s Energy and Environment Cabinet and pressed an electric utility earlier this year not to close a coal plant.
Newton, the Beshear spokesman, wrote in an email that the attorney general bases his policy decisions on what he believes is best for Kentuckians.
McConnell, Bevin, and Booth didn’t respond to requests for comment. But as recently as this month, McConnell called the Clean Power Plan a “misguided,” “job-killing” and ineffective approach to addressing climate change. Bevin has argued that such rules would suffocate businesses and wouldn’t help anyone. And in a 2013 interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader, Booth said, “When we say there’s a war on coal, we’re sincere.”
The coal mining industry has sunk at least $2.2 million into state and federal Kentucky elections since 2012, according to data from the National Institute on Money in Politics. But these companies don’t need donations to get politicians on their side.
“In Kentucky, it’s more the perception,” said Erin Savage, a program manager for Appalachian Voices, an environmental group. “If you’re not a friend of coal, then you’re not going to get the votes.”
Despite the sector’s enduring political power, coal bankruptcies are mounting as competition from natural gas, solar and wind intensifies. That creates problems beyond job losses: Kentucky and states across the country haven’t required companies to set aside enough money to clean up mines when operations cease.
Mary Cromer, deputy director of the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, worries that the fallout from rising bankruptcies and idled mines could mean more sites that increase flood risks. Her team, which represents coal miners, their families and others in Central Appalachia pro bono, can’t keep up with the demand for help as it is, she said.
That’s because Kentucky law makes it hard for people to get legal assistance with damage caused by mine-worsened floods. Coal companies aren’t required to pay victims’ attorney fees—as they would be if they’d instead contaminated local drinking water—so that expense often comes out of any settlement or court-ordered payout. Too often, Cromer said, cases don’t make financial sense for a private attorney to take.
Harless Creek residents benefited from a perverse sort of luck: They were so numerous that they could seek help from the same lawyer and spread the impact of the fees between them. On top of that, they alleged that the flood damaged well water, not just their homes.
But that wasn’t the case for Laura Thacker and her husband, Elvis, when their property in another part of the county was damaged—twice. They live next to the Bevins Branch mine, owned by the Justice family.
The state began negotiating with companies connected to the West Virginia governor and his relatives in 2014 to resolve hundreds of violations there and at other mines. In 2016, after that work was supposed to be completed, a flood destroyed the Thackers’ home. That same day, the state cited the mine for not meeting runoff control requirements. Similar flooding damaged the Thacker’s garage in 2018. The Justice companies blamed the incident on the rain, but the state pointed to the poor cleanup of the mine.
The settlements the Justice company offered the couple weren’t enough to cover the cost of rebuilding, Thacker said. But the lawyer she consulted warned that attorney fees would probably eat up whatever extra money they won if they went to trial. The Thackers had to replace their house with a smaller double-wide trailer. Their loan payment costs them $200 more a month. They couldn’t afford to move.
“People don’t understand when you go through a flood how fast everything can be taken away from you,” Thacker said. “We don’t have anything at all against coal. But … there’s rules and regulations that they need to follow.”
Mura, the Kentucky mine regulator spokesman, wrote in an email that the state is taking further action to ensure the Justice companies comply with their permit. Spokespeople for the companies and the West Virginia governor’s office didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.
Spadaro, the former federal regulator, said state officials who don’t require mines to promptly fix problems put people at risk. Violations are common. Only 57 percent of Kentucky mines inspected from July 2017 to June 2018 fully complied with the law, according to the most recent federal evaluation. More than one in 10 permitted sites had infractions that created off-site impacts, the report said.
A spokesman for the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement put a positive spin on it, noting that the share of Kentucky mines out of compliance with the law was the lowest in a decade.
Spadaro, who investigated for West Virginia the notorious 1972 Buffalo Creek disaster, in which three coal-related dams in that state failed and killed 125 people, has a harsher perspective: “There’s not one mine that I have found in compliance.”
Doug Tackett, Pike County’s emergency management director, isn’t sure what to think about climate change. Sitting in his downtown Pikeville office in June, he explained that he regularly hears from the National Weather Service about weather cycles, not the planet’s warming. The rhetoric about climate change causes and solutions is confusing, too, he said.
“They blame it on things like fossil fuels and stuff like that. But I don’t think you’ll ever get away from fossil fuels,” said Tackett, surrounded by computers, a large radio console and a walkie-talkie that murmured continuously. “It keeps the economy and everything else moving.”
A little more than half the county’s residents believe climate change is happening and 44 percent say it’s mostly caused by human activity, a lower share than the nation as a whole, according to a 2019 survey by the Yale Program on Climate Communication. When politicians express doubt about climate science, that has an effect, said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of Yale’s program.
What Tackett is certain about: He’s never seen anything like the Harless Creek disaster.
It was one of two flash floods in Pike County that July night. In the other, rescue teams were able to navigate the waters to save people in 75 homes.
In Harless Creek, that wasn’t possible. Water that normally burbled a shallow 6 inches in the creek bed had become a 12-foot-deep monster that split a house in half and carried a couple down the hollow as they held on in terror. If responders went in, Tackett said, they would have been killed. He waited, feeling helpless, trying to anticipate what people would need when it was all over.
“Neighbors were trapped, and nobody could get to them,” he said. “You say a prayer and hope they’re OK.”
Afterward, Tackett’s team trained more swift-water rescue teams. And in flood-prone areas, the county has helped elevate some homes.
But preparation only goes so far. If another flood like Harless Creek happened, Tackett said, the rushing water would still keep rescuers out. It would destroy everything in its path. Again.
Whether people lived or died would come down to luck and how well they could fend for themselves.

It Will Backfire.,Kevin Drum,MotherJones,Commentary,"Marc Thiessen has taken on the thankless task of defending the ridiculous riot Republicans staged on Wednesday, as they gathered in the Capitol basement to protest closed impeachment hearings being held in a SCIF, a room specially designed to be immune to electronic eavesdropping. Let’s hear his case:
Funny thing: Thiessen mentions Watergate but fails to mention the Clinton impeachment. Why? Because in 1998 the House barely even bothered to hold impeachment hearings, relying instead on the Starr Report to do its work for them. And needless to say, there were no national security implications to Bill Clinton’s semen stains, and therefore no need for closed hearing held in a SCIF.
As for leaks, permit me a huge guffaw. Since there were no hearings to speak of in Clinton’s case, there were no leaks either. But that’s because Ken Starr’s shop had been leaking with abandon for months and months while it compiled its report. And let’s not even get started on Republican leaking during the Benghazi and Hillary email affairs. It’s a wonder Washington DC ever dried up after those House investigations.
Thiessen also says this:
This would be a good point except that what’s changed in the past half century isn’t the partisanship of Democrats but that of Republicans. Faced with overwhelming evidence of presidential malfeasance toward Ukraine, Republicans so far have unanimously refused to give the investigation the time of day. Instead they complain about process; they pass along absurd conspiracy theories on Fox News; and they insist that extorting a foreign country for help with a presidential campaign is a mere peccadillo, not impeachable at all.
In other words, Thiessen is right about the “partisan nature” of the Trump impeachment proceedings, but the partisan nature is almost entirely on the Republican side. There are a dozen Republicans in the SCIF who have heard all the evidence and participated in the questioning. If there were anything in the testimony so far that was favorable to the president, I can pretty much guarantee they’d be leaking it gleefully. If they haven’t, it’s because there’s been nothing but bad news for Trump so far.
Let’s cut the crap. These are preliminary hearings. Republicans are participating. They’re being held in a SCIF because there are potential national security issues involved. The evidence against Trump so far is overwhelming. And yet, Republicans refuse to take it seriously. To paraphrase Thiessen himself, “If the facts are on the Republicans’ side, they have nothing to fear from serious and thorough cooperation.” So far we’ve seen nothing of that.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

A group of scientist advisers dismissed by the Trump administration has concluded that national limits on fine particles of air pollution aren’t strong enough to protect people.
The expert panel of epidemiologists and toxicologists was disbanded by the Environmental Protection Agency but decided to continue its work anyway.
The members are issuing their warnings as US regulators are reconsidering a standard for particulate matter—the inhalable pollution that is 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair. The pollution can include any of hundreds of chemicals and come from power plants, cars, construction sites and fires. It is linked with breathing and heart illnesses and early deaths.
“Based on full consideration of the overall body of scientific evidence, we unequivocally find that the current standards for fine particulate matter do not protect public health and must be revised,” said Chris Frey, a scientist from North Carolina State University who chaired the group. “There is no way for EPA to spin this otherwise.”
Frey and the other researchers worry the Trump administration may try to ease the pollution restrictions, despite the clarity of the new science. Trump agencies are rolling back environment and health protections across the board.
The scientists considered epidemiological studies that showed reducing the pollution will reduce adverse health effects.
The current annual standard for exposure to fine particle pollution is set at 12 micrograms per cubic meter, and the group believes it should be tightened to between eight micrograms and 10 micrograms.
The daily standard is 35 micrograms and should be strengthened to between 25 micrograms and 30 micrograms, the scientists said in findings released Tuesday. That would protect some areas of the country where people are exposed to fine particle pollution over short periods of time, for example, from burning wood in homes.
A new study from Carnegie Mellon University found that an increase in fine particle pollution between 2016 and 2018 was associated with 9,700 additional premature deaths.
After declining 24.2 percent between 2009 and 2016, the annual average for fine particulate matter among counties with monitors increased 5.5 percent between 2016 and 2018, according to that analysis.
The pollution rose in the west and midwest census regions and stayed the same in the north-east and south. About 43 percent of the rise in deaths happened in California, according to the working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research.
The authors believe the increase could be from increased economic activity, wildfires and an observed decrease in enforcement of certain pollution violations by the EPA.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

“Last night, the United States brought the world’s number one terrorist leader to justice,” Trump said in a statement at the White House on Sunday morning. He said that killing Baghdadi had been “the top national security priority” of his administration. The president shared prepared remarks for 10 minutes before speaking off-the-cuff for 40 minutes as he fielded questions from reporters.
He called Baghdadi “the biggest one we’ve ever captured” and said that the ISIS leader had been a global threat “long before I took office”—a not-so-subtle dig at the Obama administration, which had killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Trump also took a moment to attempt to take credit for having identified bin Laden as a terrorist threat before 9/11. (He didn’t.)
Trump clearly relished describing the final minutes of Baghdadi’s life, which he had viewed with his top generals. “The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,” Trump crowed. He said Baghdadi died “as a coward” who went “whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.” He explained that US special forces had entered Baghdadi’s compound and, after killing several of his allies, cornered him in an underground dead-end tunnel. Baghdadi then detonated an explosive vest he was wearing, killing himself and three of his young children who were in the tunnel with him. “I got to watch most of it,” the president said.
The president had previewed the news on Saturday night. “Something very big just happened!” he tweeted, igniting reports of Baghdadi’s death. President Trump told reporters on Sunday morning that “there was a very small group of people that knew about it,” none of whom where members of Congress, who he worried would leak the news. Russia wasn’t informed of the precise details of the attack, but had allowed US helicopters to fly over territory it controlled in Syria to carry out the mission.
Precisely how much this impacts the global fight against ISIS remains unclear. President Trump had already hailed the defeat of ISIS back in March, when American-backed forces had recaptured the last of the Syrian territory under ISIS control. But an August inspectors general report suggested the terrorist group had renewed its strength through fresh financial networks and new recruits in cells across Syria and Iraq. The report predicted that the the group’s regrowth would continue if the United States scaled back its involvement in the region. Dozens of ISIS prisoners are thought to have escaped following  the recent Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria and Trump’s announcement that the United States would withdraw most of its forces from the country.
“I don’t want to keep guarding Turkey and Syria for the rest of our lives,” Trump said on Sunday. “It’s very expensive, it’s very dangerous.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Trump was clearly thinking about that key moment of his predecessor’s presidency as he asserted that Baghdadi had been a threat “long before I took office” and that the ISIS leader had been “the biggest one we’ve ever captured.” He also repeated the false claim that he had identified bin Laden as a threat before 9/11.
Trump’s attempts to diminish Obama’s role in taking down bin Laden aren’t new. In the years following the raid, he frequently took to Twitter to suggest that Obama was taking too much credit for getting bin Laden. The very first mention came in November 2011, in which Trump appears to sanction the waterboarding of al Qaeda leader Khalid Sheik Mohammed for the sake of gathering intelligence on bin Laden. (The Obama administration had banned this form of torture; Trump has since tried to resurrect the practice.)

Later that year, Trump went on CNN to talk about why Obama didn’t “deserve credit for killing bin Laden.” In the spring of 2012, he reiterated that point on CNBC and in a tweet that cited an article from Breitbart.



In September 2012, a Navy SEAL who had been part of the bin Laden mission published a tell-all autobiography that contradicted some details of the Obama administration’s telling of the raid. Trump called Obama’s “story a big lie.”


On the eleventh anniversary of 9/11, Trump emphasized that a Navy SEAL killed bin Laden, setting up a new round of attacks on Obama as the 2012 election neared.

After Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney congratulated Obama during a debate for “taking out Osama bin Laden,” Trump railed against the president for taking credit for bin Laden’s slaying. He declared that the debate was the first time Obama used “we” instead of “I” in describing the terrorist leader’s death. (It was not.)









And Trump also used the bin Laden raid to take a shot at Vice President Joe Biden, tweeting that “even the SEALs who killed bin Laden” didn’t like his future political rival.

During his appearance on Face the Nation, CBS News’ Margaret Brennan pressed Pence four times whether he had “knowledge of the deal that these US officials have described under oath.” The vice president avoided directly answering the question, instead pointing to his own interactions with Zelensky, in which said he “focused entirely on President Zelensky’s agenda to bring about reforms to end corruption in Ukraine and to bring together the European community to provide greater support for Ukraine.”
“I can only tell you what I know,” Pence said. “And what I know is that the transcript of the president’s call with President Zelensky shows that there was no quid pro quo. He did nothing wrong.”

“As the facts continue to come out the American people again will see there in the President’s transcript, my interactions, there was no quid pro quo,” Pence said when asked asked a third time. “There was no pressure. It was entirely focused on issues.”
“I haven’t gotten a clear answer from you on that though, sir,” Brennan replied. “Are you saying that you did not ever hear of such a deal? Is that what I understand you’re describing?”
“I’m telling you that all of my interactions with the president, all of my conversations with President Zelensky, were entirely focused on issues of importance to the American people, ending corruption, enlisting more European support and supporting Ukraine in a way that would restore its territorial integrity and stand by Ukraine for its sovereignty,” Pence concluded.
It was an encore of a similar exchange the vice president had during a press event in Iowa earlier this month. There, NBC News reporter Vaughn Hillyard asked Pence whether he had direct knowledge that the president had held up military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens. Pence also ducked answering questions on that occasion.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

ISIS had profited from Syria’s oil, he noted, and now the Kurds could benefit from it. And, he added, “We should be able to take some also.”
Trump then repeated his assertion that the United States should have seized Iraq’s oil when it invaded that country in 2003. “I said keep the oil. If they are going into Iraq, keep the oil. They never did.” That echoed Trump’s longstanding belief that US military intervention in the Middle East should treat oil as a spoils of war, as summed up in this 2012 tweet:

Even before Trump’s latest statements, US forces had helped Kurdish-led forces retake and hold onto oil and gas fields in eastern Syria. (Mother Jones‘ Shane Bauer offers a detailed look at the battle for Syria’s energy in his recent investigation into US involvement in the country.) Yet while Syria’s fossil fuels may be strategically important, they aren’t the economic windfall Trump seems to think they are.
Syria’s oil industry has crashed since the civil war started in 2011. Last year, the country produced around 28,000 barrels a day—one fifteenth of its 2010 production and a measly 0.03 percent of the world’s total output.

In his remarks, Trump acknowledged that Syrian oil production is currently tiny. “It’s big oil underground but it’s not big oil up top,” he said. But that “big oil underground” isn’t all that big, either: According to the Energy Information Agency, Syria has 2.5 billion barrels of crude oil reserves; in comparison, Saudi Arabia has more than 100 times as much. It also has natural gas reserves, but there too it’s a small player.
Trump suggested he’d “do a deal” with a company like Exxon to ramp up Syria’s oil production. Yet even if Syria were to resume oil production at pre-war levels and Trump were somehow able to expropriate it all (a logistically and legally dicey proposition, to say the least)—it would only cover about a week of the United States’ oil consumption.
Would it even be a good deal? A back of the napkin calculation shows that a year’s worth of this oil would be valued at roughly $8 billion. The Pentagon’s budget request for its anti-ISIS operations in 2019 was $15.3 billion.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Anyway, the New York Times reports that it was a close-run thing. Apparently we learned al-Baghdadi’s general location several months ago and began an intelligence operation to track him down more precisely:
I also notice with amusement that newspaper headlines are all couching the operation in “Trump says” terms, as if they aren’t quite willing to accept it as unvarnished truth until they have more than just the president’s word.
There’s not much more to say except that Trump treated the whole thing in typically Trumpian fashion: refusing to notify Democrats ahead of time; thanking Russia for help the Russians say they didn’t provide; claiming it was the greatest anti-terrorist operation of all time; and then releasing a staged situation room picture:
This picture was taken a couple of hours after the raid, but the Trumpies were too dumb to hide their tracks by massaging the metadata in the photo to make it look like Trump was following the raid in real time. But I suppose it doesn’t matter. As Reagan taught us, all that matters is that the image itself gets into the news. And it did. A chance to mock Trump certainly got me to post a copy, didn’t it?

President Donald Trump’s latest weekend tweetstorm took aim at Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), two of the top Democrats leading the chamber’s investigation into whether Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate a political rival merits his removal from office.
He described Pelosi’s congressional district in San Francisco as “very bad and dangerous” due to “these hazardous waste and homeless sites” and repeated the false claim that Schiff “got caught cheating when he made up” in a hearing what Trump told the Ukrainian president during their July conversation. (Schiff, during the hearing, said his abbreviated retelling of the call was meant to reflect “the essence of what the president communicates”—not an exact transcript.)


The tweets, which also included a ding at Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.)’s “badly failing” presidential campaign and a video highlighting his administration’s response to the opioid crisis, occurred during the weekend broadcast of Fox & Friends, Trump’s favorite morning news show.
After the show finished airing, Trump turned to his other favorite subjects: the anonymous whistleblower, whose report incited the House’s investigation into Trump’s Ukraine call, and the “Fake Washington Post,” which published a story late Friday night detailing how Trump is “increasingly frustrated that his efforts to stop people from cooperating with the probe have so far collapsed under the weight of legally powerful congressional subpoenas.”
Friday night brought more bad news for Trump by way of a federal judge’s ruling that the impeachment inquiry is legal. The 75-page ruling also said lawmakers would be able to view redacted materials from former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election meddling, which could add a different component to the House’s widening inquiry.
Trump has not tweeted about that ruling yet, but it’s Saturday and he has no public events scheduled, so expect a busy afternoon for his keyboard.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) was one of ten Democratic presidential candidates slated to attend a bipartisan forum on criminal justice reform in South Carolina when she unexpectedly backed out after the event sponsor gave a “bipartisan justice” award to President Donald Trump. In a Twitter post Friday, the former California prosecutor said she would hold a separate event and not “be complicit in papering over his record.”
Now Harris will attend the event following the removal of the sponsor, the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Group, that bestowed the award on Trump. “She led, and she got results,” said Ian Sams, Harris’ national press secretary, on Twitter.

Harris, who received the same award as Trump in 2016, exchanged blistering tweets with him after Trump blasted her for briefly withdrawing from the forum.

“My whole life I’ve fought for justice and for the people—something you’d know nothing about,” she replied. “The only part of criminal justice you can claim credit for is the ‘criminal’ part.”
The forum where Trump was honored this week took place at historically black Benedict College, where only seven students were permitted to attend his speech. Other students and faculty members were instructed to remain inside due to “safety concerns and threats of protests,” school spokesperson Kymm Hunter told USA Today. After rejoining the forum, Harris’ campaign said in a press release that her protest would lead to “increased HBCU student participation” in the rest of the forum.
Trump, who grew to prominence among Republicans for parroting the racist lie that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, has repeatedly deployed racist rhetoric in his speeches and tweets, most recently in one that compared the House’s impeachment inquiry into his conduct to “a lynching.” The comments led to an uproar ahead of Trump’s planned remarks in South Carolina. “I definitely think that those comments were in poor taste, and they were inflammatory, and I think he should apologize,” said Tishaura Jones, Democratic co-chair of the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center. “But we’re never gonna get an apology from the president.”
Trump delivered his speech Friday as scheduled, speaking mainly about his administration’s reform bill, but veering near the end to the House’s impeachment inquiry, which he said has made him aware of the impact of an unfair justice system. “You know I have my own experience,” he said. “You see what’s going on with the witch hunt. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our country—no crimes—it’s an investigation in search of a crime.”
That same day, a federal judge in Washington, DC issued a ruling that negated the premise of Trump’s comparison. The impeachment inquiry is a legal process, the court decided, entitling lawmakers to evidence the Justice Department had said they were not entitled to.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The writer insisted they were not being racist.
These letters were written in recent months in response to a Howard County (Maryland) Council resolution calling on the county school system to desegregate its schools. The letters’ target was a comprehensive redistricting proposal offered by Howard County schools superintendent Michael Martirano. The plan would ease overcrowding and, in Martirano’s words, “substantially improve equity and access to the best educational services” in the county’s schools. By redistributing students around the district and balancing the number of poor students in the district’s schools, the proposal would make the schools more economically integrated, and thus—in theory—more racially integrated.
Howard is one of the wealthiest counties in the country, with a median household income of $115,000. But Council member Mercer Rigby said in a statement that Howard County in recent decades has been “increasingly segregated by race and socioeconomic status” and added that redistricting was a “civil rights issue.” In 2014, the Maryland Equity Project found that, of the 24 school districts in the state, Howard County ranked 15th in segregation between black and white students. Gail Sunderman, the project’s former director, pointed out in an email that poor students in the county were among the most segregated from their richer peers. Racial segregation persists once you enter the schoolhouse doors, with white students disproportionately taking Advanced Placement classes and Black students taking remedial classes, a 2017 Baltimore Sun investigation found. (A majority of kids in the district are Black, Latino, and Asian.)
At a time when schools across the country are slipping toward resegregation, the Howard County proposal would move roughly 7,400 students to different schools in a district of 57,000 kids, an effort that would reduce the number of schools with high rates of students in poverty. At 14 of the district’s 62 elementary and middle schools, per the Baltimore Sun, at least half of the students qualify for free and reduced lunch, a proxy for poverty. The plan, Martirano told the Baltimore Sun, represented “a true example of equity in action, looking at our capacity and our poverty rate so children all across the school system can receive an equitable education.” Of the more than 12,000 kids who participated in free and reduced lunch in Howard County in 2018, roughly 47 percent of them were Black and 27 percent were Latino.
The response? An all-too-familiar backlash in which race and poverty were freely conflated. In more than 400 pages of written testimony submitted to county officials since July, Howard County residents cover the whole gamut of American racism: There is the oafish, booming racism; there is the polite, cooing racism. There are the racists who cite “the data” and “the stats” to argue that Black people are subhuman; there’s the resident who cites “Dr. Ben Carson” as evidence that “disadvantaged” kids can succeed but only if their communities have “strong values.” Some decry “social engineering” and “socialism,” or warn that the plan would “destroy neighborhood schools.” Others are concerned that wealthy families would leave the district altogether. Parents and residents alike have protested against the redistricting proposal, waving signs like “No Forced Busing.” In all the aggrieved response bookended another incident in Howard County’s recent past. In May 2018, four white teenagers spray-painted the sidewalks of Glenelg High School, drawing swastikas and calling the black principal the n-word. They were later charged with hate crimes. “Howard County stands out as a place where diversity and acceptance are cherished,” Martirano had said at the time.
Decades of research—the data, the stats—has shown that integrating schools has a demonstrable effect on closing the achievement gap between Black and white students. Reading over the testimonies, though, you might begin to suspect that the fierce resistance to the desegregation plan isn’t despite the virtues of integration but because of them. In the middle of the letters is a quiet, almost plaintive testimonial, from a Columbia, Maryland, woman who supports the measure. She invoked the name of Columbia’s creator, James Rouse, who in the 1960s designed the city as an experiment in colorblind suburban development.
Below are some excerpts from the written testimony.
Correction: An earlier version of this story, citing a Baltimore Sun report, noted incorrectly that the Maryland Equity Project considered Howard County the most integrated district in the state. In 2014, Howard County ranked 15th in segregation between black and white students among the 24 school districts in the state.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Can It Stand Up to Citizens United?,Jacob Rosenberg,MotherJones,Politics,"In November, Seattle will elect a new city council. It is the second election in which the city’s democracy vouchers are in play, a first-of-its-kind financing program for taxpayers, which is either, depending on who you ask, the roadmap to fixing big money in politics across America or responsible for a $3 million jump in PAC spending.
In 2015, Seattle overwhelmingly passed Initiative 112 with 63 percent of the vote. The idea first surfaced in the broader public sphere in 2011, 13 months after the Citizens United decision allowed a new flood of corporate money into politics. Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig proposed a counterbalance in a New York Times op-ed: “more money.” Lessig argued that if corporations were able to classify vast sums of money as protected speech, it might be time to start asking how to match that capitalistic tide with money from the people. “[I]magine a system that gave a rebate of that first $50 [we pay in taxes] in the form of a ‘democracy voucher,'” Lessig proposed.
In Seattle, Alan Durning, a founder at Sightline Institute, began to imagine. He gathered a group of lawyers from the progressive policy nonprofit around a kitchen table so that they could start to “translate this theory into brass tacks,” a policy analyst at Sightline recalled. What they came to followed Lessig’s proposal closely. Each resident would receive two vouchers totaling $100 that could be given to any candidate. However, candidates must agree to a few conditions to accept the vouchers—most importantly an election specific cap on individual contributions. (If a candidate or an independent group, like a PAC, outspends the voucher user’s cap, the candidate can be released from the limit.) And the name stuck: “democracy vouchers.”
It was a hopeful moment. “There hadn’t been anything new under the public financing sun for decades—until Seattle,” said Jennifer Heerwig, a sociologist at Stony Brook University studying the program. There were signs of success in 2017, after the first election where democracy vouchers were made available; more than 20,000 people returned vouchers—only half that number made cash contributions—and voucher users were more representative of the overall electorate than cash donations. In 2015, the last off-year election for City Council that did not include a mayoral run, slightly more than 20,000 people donated to campaigns; this year, more than 40,000 have pledged support through October.
It opened doors. Emily Myers, a candidate who lost in the primary for City Council, said that as a scientist from a working-class background, “my ability to raise $15,000 in a week just wasn’t there. So the voucher program opened up some of that gatekeeping that is there for candidates.” Without it, she wouldn’t have run.
The initiative has gotten some attention as the 2020 elections are ramping up. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) discussed moving the program to the national level before she dropped out of the Democratic primary. In a September debate, Andrew Yang said he wants to “give every American 100 ‘democracy dollars’ that you can only give to candidates and causes that you like.” There was a legitimate critique circulating afterward that the plan falls into Yang’s penchant for squeezing down tough policy problems into one-size-fits-all technocratic solutions with weird names, but some Seattlites had first-hand critiques of the program itself.
“Hoo boy,” wrote Danny Westneat, a columnist at the Seattle Times. “Message to rest of nation: Copying what we did here will NOT wash special interest money out of your politics.”
Westneat is referring to the somewhat unusual circumstances of the upcoming city council race. In January 2014, Kshama Sawant became the first socialist City Council member in modern Seattle history. Sawant, alongside other progressive councilmembers, has driven a hard agenda on progressives issue that has clashed with business interests. It was her shepherding of the “head tax”—a per-employee charge on large corporations making more than $20 million per year that was passed and then quickly repealed by the council—that divided the tech-friendly, ultra-liberal city. “We have a slate of seven races where there is a business side and there is a left-progressive side (and again, these are shades of left),” explained Bob Mohan, a lawyer in Seattle. “I think that could be driving a lot of the expenditures.”
People for Seattle, a PAC close to the Chamber of Commerce that has nearly $400,000 in contributions from tech executives like Tom Alberg (Amazon), John Stanton (“wireless pioneer“), Christopher Larsen (Microsoft) has circulated flyers that call Sawant an “extremist.” Amazon recently announced it invested another $1 million in Civic Alliance for a Sound Economy, another anti-Sawant PAC, bringing their total spending this cycle to nearly $1.5 million. The boost raised the amount given to independent expenditure committees over $4 million, according to the Seattle Times. Critics say that since the vouchers put more money into elections and limited individual contributions to candidates, the wealthy have gone all-in on PACs—leading to soaring contributions in individual expenditures. Mohan, who opposed the initiative, told Mother Jones that his concern was that the protections established in Citizens United means that “any well-intention effort to plug [spending] is just going to result in people going around it.”
“The election cycle’s been kind of bonkers,” admits Vy Nguyen, a staffer for Councilmember M. Lorena González, who recently proposed a bill that would cap contributions by political committees.
The democracy voucher program never promised to totally solve corporate contributions, but it did offer an opportunity to widen the candidate and donator pool. Liz Dupee, who worked as a housing advocate before moving to Democracy Hub to help advocate for the vouchers, was convinced in part to join the effort because it helped her former boss, Jon Grant, run for city council on a housing platform. (Grant, somewhat famously, went to a homeless encampment to ask for donations from vouchers.)
Austin, Texas is considering a similar program, as is Albuquerque, New Mexico.  If the democracy vouchers philosophy were to expand, Heerwig said that Seattle’s ability to release candidates from the limitations on independent donations would be important.
Either way, Cindy Black, of Fix Democracy First, a fair elections group that helped champion the legislation, said democracy vouchers are better thought of as one part of a larger fight. “One of the things that we advocate is for a long-term solution is a constitutional amendment that would overturn [Citizens United],” she said. “But we know the reality is that we’re a long way off.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

That’s the startling message of a growing weight of research led by Irakli Loladze, a mathematical biologist with joint appointments at the Bryan College of Health Sciences in Nebraska and Arizona State University. On the latest episode of Bite—the introduction to our new series, “Eating in Climate Chaos“—I caught up with Loladze to learn more about this slow-motion nutritional train wreck and what we can do about it.
Plants are very flexible in their chemical composition, Loladze explained. When the air that surrounds them is richer in CO2, they use it to synthesize more carbohydrates, including starches and sugars, which are then stored in plant cells. Essentially, more carbon in the air means more carbs in plants, and these carbs then dilute the other beneficial chemicals taken up and/or synthesized by the plants.
Loladze asked me to consider my breakfast on the morning of our interview, which was centered on a piece of toast. Citing a 2004 study led by Lewis Ziska, then a US Department of Agriculture researcher, now a professor at Columbia University, Loladze said that the wheat I consumed that day likely contained lower levels of protein than the wheat that people were consuming decades ago. More recent research suggests that it also delivered fewer of “nearly all the essential minerals—calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, potassium, and copper,” he said.
And what’s true for humans is also true for all the herbivorous and omnivorous animals that rely on wild plants for nutrients. They’re getting less of them now, too, he said, and the deficit moves up the food chain, from the rabbit nibbling on weeds to the bobcat that eats that rabbit. The effect has already shown up in cows, which are gobbling up grasses with lower levels of vital nutrients, which has forced the beef industry to add mineral supplements to cattle rations.
Interestingly, the drop in these chemicals has no effect on the plants themselves. “It’s not like plants are hurting” from the extra CO2, he said. “They have mechanisms to be flexible, and they just store more” carbohydrates. “Plants aren’t the least concerned about the quality of our nutrition—we eat them, we’re kind of their enemies. So diluting the quality of their consumers’ food is something that plants really don’t mind at all.”
In a paper published in 2018, Loladze and a team including US Department of Agriculture and University of Washington researchers found that increasing CO2 concentrations had diminished the nutritional quality of rice, causing significant drops in protein, iron, zinc, as well as vitamins B1, B2, B5, and B9. But research on carbon dioxide concentration and food quality gets very little funding, Loladze noted, and at least under President Donald Trump, is usually buried by the US Department of Agriculture. Rather than sound the alarm about the results of a study revealing that a crop that serves as a crucial staple for 600 million people in low-income countries worldwide is deteriorating, the USDA declined to publicize it, and tried to convince the University of Washington not to, either, as Politico’s Helena Bottemiller reported in June. Loladze told me that in Trump’s USDA, there’s an “implicit directive not to promote agriculture research related to climate change.”
Meanwhile, of course, we keep burning fossil fuels, spewing more carbon into the air, which in turn gets taken up by the plants we eat, diluting the vital nutrients with loads of carbs. I asked Loladze what we can do about it, given that global carbon emissions show no sign of dropping anytime soon. He said that regenerative farming practices, as well as adding certain minerals to soil, can counteract at least some of the carbon dilution. Right now, he said, we pay farmers for yield—they’re rewarded for total output, not for the amount of nutrients in their crops.
“If we want to make our food more nutritious, we should change the incentives,” he said. “We should start paying farmers for nutritional quality—and once that happens, people will get healthier and there’ll much less hunger hidden hunger, which is when people get more enough calories but don’t get enough nutrients.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Sackler Gallery. The exhibition, Yoga: The Art of Transformation, was the first major show ever mounted about the 2,500-year history of yoga. It featured over a hundred paintings, photographs, and sculptures. Curators, seeking a contemporary perspective, invited me to contribute to an educational exhibit for the show after having met me at a previous event. At the same time, I had another project up, at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, documenting the Indian American motel community across this country. It was an exciting time for me. But I didn’t expect the absurdities that would soon follow—a parade of condescension, passive aggressiveness, and white fragility in which the Asian Art Museum revealed itself to be in a losing struggle with the whiteness at the core of its identity.
My run-in with the museum is the subject of new work I’m showing this month at the Human Resources gallery in Los Angeles. It’s taken me this long to tell the story because it was such a jarring experience. This was the Asian Art Museum, the largest museum dedicated exclusively to the Asian arts in the United States—one of the largest platforms out there for an artist like me.
When I was asked to contribute, I took the invitation at face value: The Asian Art Museum wanted to give space to an Indian American artist. Much of my work focuses on first-generation Indian American experiences with appropriation and assimilation. The museum provided a first-floor wall—a big platform and a big honor.
Our agreement for the installation included my assemblage of yoga ephemera that I’d collected in the form of magazines, books, posters, and album covers. Together they told the story of how the $16 billion yoga industry in this country had rebranded a South Asian discipline to sell yoga as a line of products—how yoga became Yoga™. It’s no coincidence that you rarely see a South Asian person on the cover of Yoga Journal magazine. Yoga has been put in an ironic position: Colonized and commodified, a tradition rooted in detachment and equanimity has been hijacked by a grasping possessiveness. I titled my work #WhitePeopleDoingYoga.
I knew the title #WhitePeopleDoingYoga would be provocative, but I chose it for a reason: For this installation, yoga was a case study in how culture gets colonized, a pattern that holds across industries, from fashion to food to music. The installation was meant to show how overwhelming and suffocating appropriation becomes under a capitalist structure. Every piece in the installation was either selling something or was itself once for sale.
But once my proposal made the rounds among curators, educators, and PR folks, cracks started to show in the museum’s support for the installation. The show’s lead curators and education staffers I’d met—all but one of whom were white—didn’t feel completely comfortable with the title. They wanted something innocuous like #PeopleDoingYoga, without the word “white,” because the term “white people” could be “offensive” to museumgoers, donors, and staff. During our initial meetings at the museum, they told me to “turn down the volume” of my critique. They also insisted I remove a section of the installation—a Hindu-inspired shrine featuring photographs of a white couple as South Asian gurus. “This might be offensive to Indian people,” staffers said—white authorities telling me what Indian people might find offensive. They gave me an ultimatum: Either I take down the shrine, or they don’t include my installation. Museum leaders were diluting my installation, going well beyond the standard curatorial role.
[In an email to a Mother Jones fact-checker, museum reps acknowledge that there had been misgivings over the title and the installation in general, which they emphasize was intended to be “educational” rather than artistic. But they dispute that there was any ultimatum. According to a museum spokesperson, Bhakta was told that the phrase “white people” could be “offensive or puzzling” to some. As examples, the spokesperson pointed to “Anglo practitioners of yoga unfamiliar with the concepts of cultural appropriation/appreciation, and K-12 students who haven’t had the proper exposure to understand the statement implied in ‘White People Doing Yoga.'” Additionally, in the same email to Mother Jones, Qamar Adamjee, one of the exhibit’s curators, writes that the museum objected to the shrine on the grounds that “as an object type [it] did not align with the rest of the display,” but that the installation was not contingent on its removal: “We had invited him to do the display and revoking that invitation was not a consideration at any point.”]
Over the years, I’ve heard many shocking accounts from friends—artists of color from New York to Bombay, Los Angeles to London—about their experiences with institutional racism in its various forms. The numbers alone tell some of the story: A recent Williams College study found that 75 percent of artists in major US museums are white men, and the Association of Art Museum Directors reports that 72 percent of staff at its member institutions are white. These are the people who shape and reshape the canon, who have the power to decide and dismiss.
Consider the Asian Art Museum’s own history: It was founded on the collection of Avery Brundage, a Chicago businessman and the fifth president of the International Olympic Committee. Brundage’s portrait still hangs proudly in the museum library; a bust of him greets you at the entrance of the museum. In 1959, Brundage began donating his Asian artwork to the city of San Francisco—a collection that would amount to nearly 8,000 pieces. What the museum leaves out of its public narrative is that its founder was “the preeminent American apologist for Nazi Germany,” in the words of author Jeremy Schaap. In the ’60s, the Olympic Committee for Human Rights, a group protesting racism in sports, demanded Brundage’s removal as the Olympics president. The committee had exposed his ownership of a country club in California that excluded Jewish and black people from its membership. In response to a potential boycott by black athletes of the 1968 Olympics, Brundage notoriously said, “They won’t be missed.” (He had been instrumental in preventing a US boycott of the so-called Nazi games in 1936.)  Brundage was “a racist down to his toes,” said Lee Evans, an American sprinter on the 1968 Olympic team. “A brutal, racist pig,” said a teammate, Marty Liquori. A “Jew hater and a Jew baiter,” was the verdict of Gustavus Town Kirby, delivered in a 1936 letter to Brundage himself. Now think about how a man like this actually acquired his art collection. Don’t fool yourself.
The Asian Art Museum is far from the only institution negotiating its own white supremacist foundations. Just a few years ago, the British Museum’s Twitter account revealed as much when it shared how it decides to label artwork, tweeting: “We aim to be understandable by 16 year olds. Sometimes Asian names can be confusing, so we have to be careful about using too many.” (Dang, sorry to all those 16-year-old Asian kids with funny names.)
My installation went up after rounds of hard-fought revisions. I stood firm on the title #WhitePeopleDoingYoga, but I caved on the museum’s ultimatum: I took down the shrine depicting a white couple as South Asian gurus.
Let’s break this shit down: Here were white elites exerting power over Brown critique that was explicitly about white elites exerting power over Brown culture. The irony is comical now, but it was painful and unnerving then. After taking parts down, I thought the worst was over, but it was only the beginning. People across the operation, from the marketing department to the education team to the curatorial staff, continued to sterilize my perspective, tiptoeing around me to make themselves feel more comfortable and spare the museum further controversy. Brown critique had to be sanitized for white consumption.
Throughout my meetings with curators and educators, there was one person whose name they kept mentioning as an authority calling the shots—the chief curator, also white, an unseen figure in the forest who seemed to be deliberately keeping a distance. At first, I wouldn’t have expected the chief curator to get involved, but it was a bit alarming that he never did, given all that went down. Some of the staffers under him were maneuvering through tense conversations with me, like messengers nervously doing their boss’s bidding to keep their jobs. I completely sympathize, but it left me wondering: Was I seeing the museum’s disorganization or something more malicious, a deliberate mixing of messages? It felt as if I’d hit a sore spot with several white staffers. Some of them had dedicated their entire lives to Asian arts, and now they had been implicated in my critique of appropriation. Why were they being criticized, they seemed to wonder. Weren’t they the ones giving nonwhite artists like me a platform?
I’d soon caught wind that senior staffers, without telling me, had decided to withhold my work’s title from marketing material. This was enraging. The title #WhitePeopleDoingYoga was my observation—my statement as an Indian American. It was the core of my piece; the ephemera was just the vehicle, and the museum knew that. This battle over a title became a proxy for something bigger: a struggle over whose sensitivities needed to be protected and whose could be ignored.
As part of the marketing rollout for the yoga show, the museum planned to publish a 12-by-12-inch, 24-page advertising supplement in the San Francisco Examiner, the SF Weekly, and the SF Bay Guardian. In all, 250,000 copies were being printed. The museum had decided behind my back that it was not going to promote my work in an honest way—not just by excluding the title but also by dumbing down the description of my work. At one point, a draft of the marketing material referred to my work as an “amusing” and “lighthearted” collection.
And of course my title was nowhere to be found in the supplement. I decided to insert it myself: I contacted the supplement’s ad team, without consulting the museum, and took out my own full-page ad:
I paid out of pocket, negotiating a reduced rate that was equal to what the museum had paid me for my installation: $1,500. Straight into my hands for my work and straight out of my hands for my ad, all to retain my voice. Symmetry at its finest.
By this point, the museum store had already agreed to sell merch that I would create: T-shirts, tote bags, and postcards. (Ah, the irony of selling products for an installation critiquing capitalism.) When it came time to display my merch in the store, the marketing chief found out that my stuff bore the title #WhitePeopleDoingYoga and froze: In a meeting with two PR leaders, the marketer told me in a chipper, condescending voice that they weren’t sure where they stood on my merch. They needed a few days to think it through while keeping all the products in the basement.
I called a meeting, inviting all 11 staffers who’d been involved in the process, nine of whom were white. What an awkward meeting. I met them in this grand, lavish, colonial-style boardroom, and from across a formal table, I listened to the marketing chief declare that the words “white people” are “offensive” and appear “out of context” on the merch. (Isn’t all merch out of context?) Remember, this was an approved title. If a museum is going to approve an artwork’s title, either stand by it or don’t. The push-and-pull was infuriating and exhausting. Getting a clear position from the museum was like trying to play catch with a balloon.
One of the museum’s staff members, who was white, came to my defense in that boardroom. He exposed the museum’s hypocrisy by holding up its own branded tote bag that bore only the word “Asian” on it, and as I remember it he said, “I’m a white man walking around San Francisco with this bag that just says ‘Asian’ on it, without ‘museum,’ and it’s completely ‘out of context.’ Why is our bag okay but Chiraag’s is not?” The marketing chief’s response: “Well, that’s our brand, so it’s okay.”
And what to do with all those stacks of merch that they weren’t going to sell anymore? I joked that they should ship them to India—put some shirts on kids’ backs and create some interesting conversation. My other suggestion: Give the merch back to me. The museum eventually pulled all my bags and shirts from the store and sold them to me for a total of $1, to acknowledge the transaction.
The opening parties featured Indian classical music performed by white people, acro-yoga performed by white people, a chanting group mostly comprising white people, and a white couple from Marin teaching yoga for an hour. There was a sprinkle of Brown acts, but the headliner—wait for it—was a white rapper named MC Yogi, who spit about yoga and Indian culture over a beat dropped by DJ Drez, a white DJ with dreads. (Reminder: the largest institution of Asian art in the United States.)
Onstage behind the musicians was a massive projection of MC Yogi’s name, an Om symbol, and a crown—the very symbol of British oppression over India for hundreds of years. Here was a white artist mashing symbols and cultures—Indian and hip-hop—to root his identity in the fetishization of Brown and cool purely for his own benefit, disregarding communities of color.
To a certain kind of liberal-minded white person, perspectives like MC Yogi’s are commonly viewed as positive. He is “sharing” and “celebrating” cultures, not raiding them for his own benefit. In these contexts, positivity acts as a sort of Trojan horse; it’s how you smuggle white supremacy into the gates. Perspectives like mine, on the other hand, are widely seen as negative, divisive. The title of my upcoming show in Los Angeles plays on this concept: Why You So Negative?
The yoga show in 2013–2014 was scheduled to make one last stop after San Francisco, in Cleveland. I spoke with the Cleveland Art Museum to see if its curators wanted to include my installation. The lead curator said the idea was “hugely interesting” and “there is a lot of enthusiasm for your project here at CMA.” The curator flew to San Francisco and met me in person. Enthusiasm kept building. The conversation progressed far enough that we began talking costs, which didn’t seem like a sticking point. The curator even emailed me an internal floorplan of the show to finalize gallery placement.
After more than a month of fine-tuning our plans, the curator said there was one last “hurdle” to clear before approval: The Cleveland museum planned to invite the city’s commercial yoga studios to teach classes and had to make sure the studios felt comfortable in the same space as an installation titled #WhitePeopleDoingYoga. That’s when the plans fell apart. Out of nowhere, the curator—the uneasy messenger—emailed me to say the museum felt that my installation would be “ad hoc” (odd, given that we’d spent a month planning it). And, wait, what had happened to that last “hurdle”? It’s not surprising that local businesses could mute a museum’s platform; that’s what happens when you trade curatorial integrity for financial obligations. (Mother Jones couldn’t reach the curator for comment.)
The whole ordeal left me exhausted. My own community was a source of comfort, though. My friend Vijay Iyer, the jazz composer, MacArthur “genius” grant winner, and Harvard arts professor, gave me reassurance that I was not alone. In a talk he delivered in 2014 at Yale, he mentioned my installation in San Francisco, saying it was part of a “problematic exhibit,” and called out “Northern California culture’s imperial relationship to all things Indian.” Vijay was speaking as a South Asian American who’d spent plenty of time “navigating and resisting the exoticizing, incorporating tendencies of white American cultural omnivores”:
That was it: My experience with the Asian Art Museum was an exercise in watching white people work out their identity on the back of mine. The platform they seemed to give me, it turned out, wasn’t actually for me—it was for them, a way to fashion my Brownness into something they could wear. White supremacy works that way, for all “minorities”; it censors any critique contained in nonwhite expression and commodifies and tokenizes whatever’s left, forcing people like me into the posture of the model minority.
But I’m the negative one, right?

https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/under-trump-whistleblowers-have-even-less-protection-than-usual/,2019-10-25,,,politics,"October 25, 2019","Under Trump, Whistleblowers Have Even Less Protection Than Usual",Nathalie Baptiste,MotherJones,Politics,"For the entire Trump administration, the federal government has been operating without a functioning agency to protect whistleblowers. “Although seldom in the public spotlight, no institution is more important for accountable government than the Merit Systems Protection Board,” Tom Devine, legal director of the Government Accountability Project said at a February congressional hearing on the independent, quasi-judicial agency. And for more than two years, the board has been dysfunctional.
When it’s working, the MSPB protects whistleblowers who reveal wrongdoings in the management of most federal agencies, covering more than 2 million civilian federal employees. The board was created in 1979 to address retaliation against whistleblowers. When whistleblowers were demoted, stripped of responsibilities, or fired, they were able to turn to the three-member board of the MSPB for intervention. Recent members of the board have been labor lawyers with experience in government.
But since March, the board has had no members.
All three spots were filled until 2015, when a member’s term expired and the Republican-led Senate refused to vote on President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace her. In January 2017, another board member’s term ended, leaving one lone member, whose term ended in March. The Trump administration proposed three nominees to the board: Chad Bungard, deputy commissioner at the Social Security Administration; Dennis Kirk, an Army lawyer; and Julia Clark, who has worked at an agency representing government employees. But their confirmation has been stalled in the Senate because Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hasn’t scheduled a vote. McConnell’s office did not return a request for comment.
The lack of a fully functioning board, says Rebecca Jones, policy counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, “will have a potentially chilling effect on federal employees coming forward.”
Protections for whistleblowers have taken on a new urgency in recent months. It was a whistleblower who revealed the July telephone call where President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for help discrediting Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 elections. After Democrats announced an impeachment inquiry and began investigating the scandal, Trump responded by condemning the whistleblower on Twitter.

For whistleblowers, there are two levels to the MSPB appeals process. After a whistleblower who has experienced retaliation for coming forward files an appeal with the MSPB, the case is assigned to an administrative judge. This judge can determine whether the action the agency took was legal. If the whistleblower does not agree with the decision, he or she can appeal to the board, which would review the case, make its determination, and return the case to the judge for a final disposition. The system doesn’t always work in favor of the whistleblower, as administrative judges rarely reverse their decisions. But the board can offer what Devine describes as “a modest but meaningful good influence” on the judges. Without board oversight, whistleblowers are less likely to win their cases with administrative judges. Devine testified to Congress that between November 2018 and January 2019, only one out of 30 whistleblowers prevailed.
Whistleblowers can still report claims of retaliation to the US Office of Special Counsel, an independent investigative and prosecutorial agency. The office can accept the initial whistleblower complaint and any claims of retaliation, but it doesn’t have the power to force the agency in question to do anything. “There’s really no teeth behind it,” Jones explains.
According to Devine, the ability of the MSPB to provide temporary relief is one of the most important aspects of the Whistleblower Act, which created the board. “These cases can drag on for years,” he says. “During that time, the whistleblower is broke and probably unemployable.” When the board grants a stay, the agency is forced to halt all actions, such as demotions and suspensions, while the case is being investigated. “But since the OSC can’t go to the board,” Devine says, “agencies have been telling the OSC lawyers to get lost.”
The lack of a merit board is particularly detrimental during an administration plagued by scandal. In May 2017, the chief of staff to Tom Price, who was then the secretary of health and human services, sent a memo to employees instructing them to not have any communication with members of Congress or their staffs without prior approval from top officials at the Department of Health and Human Services. The memo did not include any language about exceptions for whistleblowers, drawing the ire of Republican lawmakers. Four months later, Price resigned after a Politico investigation found that he’d used taxpayer money to take private jets for official government travel and family vacations. The following year, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, was called out by Kevin Chmielewski, an EPA staffer who blew the whistle on Pruitt’s excessive spending on flights to his home state of Oklahoma and stays in expensive hotels. Chmielewski was placed on administrative leave after he refused to approve lavish expenditures. Three months later, Pruitt resigned in a haze of scandal. Chmielewski said he felt vindicated, telling the Hill, “I hate to take a credit for a man losing his job, but I guess I’d have to say that I take the credit.”
In his February testimony to Congress, Devine cited the case of Kim Farrington, a whistleblower at the Federal Aviation Administration. In 2010, the aviation safety inspector was harassed and fired after she blew the whistle on the FAA’s failure to “assure proper oversight of the training of flight attendants.” In 2012, the MSPB overturned the administrative judge’s decision to dismiss her case. Further delays ensued, and in 2016, Farrington complained to the board about the lack of resolution. The administrative judge once again rejected her claims, and her case made its way back to the board. But by that point, there were no board members, and her ordeal has no end in sight.
Blowing the whistle on government wrongdoings has always been a risky gambit. Whistleblowers in the intelligence community have faced jail time under Democratic and Republican administrations. But according to Devine, the lack of a merit board is already affecting whistleblower cases. “Previously, they would win about 7 percent of their cases,” he says. “That rate has dropped to less than 5 percent.” When the board eventually starts back up in earnest, the new members will have a backlog of more than 2,000 cases to comb through, which could take years.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

It Doesn’t Really Work That Way.,Will Peischel,MotherJones,Environment,"Buried in the flurry of headline-grabbing statements last week by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney about Ukraine, presidential quid pro quo, and a plan to host the next G7 summit at the president’s own golf resort was another announcement that attracted less notice. Climate change, Mulvaney said, won’t be included in the G7 summit’s formalized agenda when the leaders of the world’s major economic powers meet in June.
While the administration has backed off its intention to hold the event at Trump’s Doral resort in Florida, it hasn’t budged on its plans for the summit agenda. The country hosting the summit—in this case, the United States—sets the agenda. But that doesn’t mean the other G7 members will allow climate change to go undiscussed.
Even if the host country lays out the official agenda, the meeting’s attendees are still basically free to discuss whatever they deem important. According to an EU official with knowledge of the G7 proceedings, some EU delegates still plan to make climate change a focus of the summit.
“We are aware of where the US stands on this, and we understand that they want to focus more on the economy,” says the EU official, “and it’s the prerogative that the US sets the agenda—the agenda is set by the president—but all members have the right to bring what they want to the table.”
Every year, with increasing conspicuousness, Trump has snubbed the G7 forum’s climate dialogue. It started in 2017, when the administration refused to join other world leaders in reaffirming a commitment to the Paris climate agreement, and it culminated at the most recent summit in August, when Trump skipped the meeting’s climate dialogue. These slights haven’t stopped other nations from addressing climate change, as EU leaders intend to do again next year.
“We feel that economy and development are closely related to environmental issues,” says the official.
Recent summits, hosted by countries committed to tackling the climate crisis, have resulted in significant resolutions to mitigate climate change, even as the United States has put the brakes on its own commitments. When France hosted the G7 this year, five members of the group pledged nearly $6 billion to the Green Climate Fund, which helps developing countries adapt to a changing climate. In 2018, the majority of members agreed on a blueprint for clean oceans that included a 2030 goal for all produced plastics to be recyclable or reusable. Four years ago in Germany, all the G7 countries agreed to provide insurance against climate threats to 400 million vulnerable people, primarily in Africa and the Caribbean.
While other members of the G7 might be able to present whatever issues they please at the next summit, it’s unclear what actions they’ll actually be able to take without the participation of the United States. And if the host is unwilling even to put climate change on the agenda, any meaningful cooperation from the United States appears remote.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The so-called fetal heartbeat bill would ban abortion when a heartbeat can be detected, which is around six weeks, before many women know they’re pregnant. It would also impose potential criminal penalties for doctors who perform abortions after that point.
The original bill carved out exceptions for cases of rape and incest. But on Tuesday, a subcommittee in the state senate passed an amendment to remove those exceptions. The 4-3 vote, along party lines, sends the amended bill to the full Senate Medical Affairs Committee. If the bill passes the committee, it will go on to the full South Carolina senate for a vote.
Republican state Sen. Richard Cash introduced the amendment, stating, “Rape and incest are terrible crimes. They cause so much pain and suffering. It is understandable that women who have been the victims of such crimes may wish not to carry babies if a baby is conceived to full term. However, there are other considerations.”
“I cannot believe what I am hearing,” said Democratic state Sen. Kevin Johnson, who also sits on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee, adding, “If this amendment passes and the bill passes, now we are requiring a lady who should have a right to choice to not be allowed to choose what she wants with her body, and now we’re saying although you were innocent and were raped, you’ve got to carry that baby for nine months. That’s just horrific.”
The legislation is part of a nationwide push in Republican-led legislatures for abortion bans early in pregnancy. Nine states—Georgia, Ohio, Kentucky, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Utah, and Arkansas—have already passed pre-viability abortion bans. State lawmakers, emboldened by the confirmation of conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, hope that by passing laws which directly challenge the precedent set in Roe v. Wade, they can force the Supreme Court to examine and overturn its landmark 1973 decision.
So far, none of these bans have survived a legal challenge, but that hasn’t kept lawmakers from continuing to pass them—even though some anti-abortion groups have openly questioned the strategy.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

My point here is not to recap every detail of how Ukrainegate has played out. My point is to show that this was no spur-of-the-moment outburst from President Trump. He’s clearly been obsessed by it for nearly a year, and he’s involved a wide cast of characters: Giulani, Taylor, Sondland, Volker, Mulvaney, Barr, Yovanovitch, Shulkin, Lutsenko, and a number of others.
This is what makes Ukrainegate such a big deal. It would be bad enough if it were just a typical Trump outburst, soon forgotten by all involved. But it wasn’t: it’s been a wide-ranging, year-long effort to extort a foreign country to smear a political opponent. If that’s not impeachable, nothing is.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Eric Holder Explains Why It’s “Reprehensible.”,Abigail Weinberg,MotherJones,Politics,"The day after President Donald Trump ignited backlash by comparing his impeachment inquiry to a lynching, former Attorney General Eric Holder called the comment “reprehensible.”
“You think about thousands of people who were lynched in this nation. To compare that to a constitutionally mandated, or constitutionally authorized, process that’s underway in our Congress was reprehensible,” said Holder, who became the first African American attorney general when he was appointed by Barack Obama. “That’s reflective of who this man is and why he’s got to get his ass beaten in 2020.”

During an exclusive interview with Mother Jones voting rights reporter Ari Berman, Holder expressed his disappointment with the conduct of the current administration. When asked whether impeaching Trump is warranted, Holder quipped, “You gonna ask me a hard question?” before adding that any novice prosecutor would have indicted Trump for obstruction of justice based on the Mueller report alone.

And, while acknowledging the tricky optics of criticizing one’s successor, Holder concluded that acting Attorney General William Barr—who is now managing a criminal inquiry into the Justice Department’s own Russia investigation—was “unfit for the job.” Holder said that Barr thinks of himself as Trump’s lawyer rather than the lawyer for the people of the United States, and that he holds him in even lower esteem than Trump’s previous attorney general, Jeff Sessions.
“This is an administration unlike any other,” he said. “I have been in this town since 1976, served under Republican as well as Democratic presidents in various jobs that I’ve had in the Justice Department, and I’ve never, ever seen anything like we are in the process of experiencing.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Amid farm fields in upstate New York is a wooden platform that serves as the Appalachian Trail’s very own train station. It sits on the Metro-North Harlem line, which shuttles commuters in and out of New York City on weekdays. On weekends, it offers direct access to the wilderness, though not every New Yorker knows about it. So, for the last six years, the National Parks Conservation Association and the Harlem Valley Appalachian Trail Community have hosted Appalachian Trail Day to get the word out.
This time of year, trails like this one are ripe for leaf peeping, an activity which, for many Americans, means heading to state and national parks—often by car. Others who want to enjoy the sights of peak fall foliage may choose to drive along scenic highways, of which the US built hundreds of thousands of miles to encourage driving for pleasure. Today, road trips remain the preferred activity for nearly two-thirds of fall travelers, according to the American Automobile Association.
Yet the ever-growing urgency of climate change highlights a glaring irony: Taking a scenic drive contributes to the demise of the very things that make those trips, well, scenic.
Many private companies offer alternatives to car-powered fall tours, including scenic train rides aboard vintage trains, tour buses to far-flung parks, and boat tours along rivers flanked by trees. Those can get pricey, though, with some options running upwards of $100 each way.
Luckily, in some parts of the country, transit alternatives offer other ways to escape the city and be shuttled right into the heart of autumn’s reds, oranges, and yellows.
The train to the upstate New York trail, for example, takes an hour and a half from Grand Central Terminal, for $17.50 each way. On Appalachian Trail Day, which took place earlier this month, NPCA and its partner hosted a number of fall activities, including pumpkin picking for families and guided hikes through the lush forest. There is parking, but the organizers strongly encouraged families to take the commuter train.
“You are literally stepping off of the train onto the trail,” says Lauren Cosgrove, who manages NPCA’s northeast branch. “And you’ll be in the beautiful peak fall foliage of the Harlem Valley.”
Much of the organization’s other work in New York City involves improving access to various national parks in the area. But just as importantly, the NPCA also focuses on educating people about what’s already available. “We are actively promoting making people aware that there are a dozen national parks in the city, and another dozen in the greater tri-state area that are all accessible by public transportation,” Cosgrove says.
Overall, the National Park Service’s latest transit inventory and performance report identifies 99 transit systems in 65 of its more than 400 parks nationwide. Most—81 percent—are operated by the private sector, and nearly two-thirds consisted of shuttles, buses, vans, or trams. Just 4 percent involve railway. More than half operate on a seasonal basis, running three to six months of the year.
That includes free shuttles, like the one from Springdale, Utah, to Zion National Park, which bans cars between March and November. (The caveat here, of course, is that you have to get to Springdale first.) It also includes free and low-fare shuttles by the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System from counties like Fresno, Mariposa, and Merced to Yosemite National Park—where dogwood and maple trees offer a “pop of color” amid the valley’s abundant evergreens.
Those nostalgic for the old-fashioned activity of admiring fall foliage from a train have public options, too. Since 1989, NPS has partnered with the nonprofit Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad in Ohio to run trains to the valley from Cleveland and Akron. In 2017, CVSR introduced the Fall Flyer, a limited two-hour excursion through the Cuyahoga Valley National Park on weekends specifically for leaf peepers. The route runs from October to the beginning of November, when the region hits peak foliage, and costs between $20 and $25 per passenger.
Meanwhile, scenic train rides have long been a selling point for Amtrak. In the Northeast, for example, the route between New York City and Montreal offers a leisurely, scenic ride through the Hudson Valley and the Adirondack Mountains. Out west, Amtrak’s California Zephyr from San Francisco to Denver cuts through Tahoe National Forest in Utah and several other parks in Colorado. Tickets aren’t cheap, though: A one-way ticket can cost as much as $100 or so.
But going leaf peeping doesn’t have to mean organizing a great escape away from the city. In cities where trees are abundant, familiar urban parks can still offer city dweller a breathtaking view of fall. New York City, for example, manages some 30,000 acres of public parkland, which are filled with historic sites and walkable and bike-friendly paths—along with ample tree cover. (Manhattan’s Central Park alone boasts roughly 18,000 trees.)
If you’re itching to get out of town as peak fall foliage makes its way across the US, it’s tempting to consider a road trip to a remote woodsy area to immerse yourself in the changing leaves. There aren’t always easy options to get that same experience without the car, but some of these transit alternatives could provide a model for more like them in the future.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

It’s a balance of the beats and lyrics that made up the era of Ke$ha—at one point she and Freedia chant over a church organ to “bounce it up and down where the good Lord split it”—while delivering on Kesha’s under-appreciated vocals of the Rainbow era. All this while just being a damn fun listen—which is sometimes all we can ask for.

Here it is:
That doesn’t look quite so bad, does it? Now, it’s true that Donald Trump said it would be a piece of cake to get rid of the deficit and he hasn’t done it. It’s also true that you don’t really want to see the deficit getting bigger during an economic expansion. So this is not a great result.

Since 2017, as part of its efforts to “hire American,” the Trump administration has been aggressively denying applications for H-1B visas. Yet a record number of those denials have been overturned on appeal, suggesting that the administration has been wrongfully rejecting qualified applicants for these coveted visas for high-skilled immigrants.
While President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants has grabbed public attention, his administration has been dismantling the work-based immigration system as well. In April 2017, Trump issued the Buy American and Hire American executive order, which he promised would reform the high-skilled immigration program to “create higher wages and employment rates for workers in the United States.” Since then, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has been denying and delaying record numbers of H-1B visa petitions. The denial rate for first time H-1B applications went up from 10 percent in 2016 to 24 percent in 2019.
!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var e in a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-""+e)||document.querySelector(""iframe[src*='""+e+""']"");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][e]+""px"")}})}();
H-1B visas, also known as tech visas, are temporary work permits filed by American businesses that want to hire high-skilled immigrants for jobs where there’s a shortage of domestic workers. The visas are widely used by the technology industry, but H-1Bs are also issued to universities, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and management consultants.
If an employer’s H-1B visa application is denied, they may ask USCIS’s Administrative Appeals Office to reexamine the decision. Typically, a small percentage of denied applicants file an appeal, mostly because the appeals office takes six months to a year to respond. Most employers prefer to refile the application, which is faster.
Historically, the appeals office usually sides with the agency’s original decision. Between the 2014 and 2017 fiscal years, it reversed about 3 percent of the H-1B decisions it reviewed. Yet in 2018, it overruled USCIS in nearly 15 percent of H-1B appeals. It remanded more than 7 percent of decisions, sending them back to be reevaluated, compared with 4 percent in the previous four years.

Immigration attorneys say many H-1B cases that would have been slam-dunk approvals during the Obama administration are now being improperly denied, which would explain the increase in reversals upon appeal. “Previously, deniable cases were being denied and approvable cases were being approved,” says William Stock, a founding member of Klasko Immigration Law Partners, who specializes in employment-based visas. “What we are seeing now is that approvable cases are being denied, so what the [appeals office] is saying is, ‘This is an approvable case, it shouldn’t have been denied.’”
Approximately 85,000 H-1B visas are issued annually. Jobs that qualify for an H-1B usually require visa holders to have a bachelor’s or an advanced degree in fields related to their positions. H-1Bs are typically issued for a three-year period and may be renewed for another three years. If a visa holder has applied for residency by the end of those six years, they may renew their H-1B every three years until they receive legal permanent residency—a wait that may stretch over years or decades.
The idea to restrict H-1B visas was in the works even before Trump took office. Stephen Miller, a senior advisor to Trump and the architect of the president’s immigration policy, talked at length about curbing H-1Bs in a series of radio interviews on Breitbart News Daily in 2015. “We are talking about less-skilled foreign guest workers that are less educated than Americans, who are paid less than Americans, who know less about the computing industry and about the technology industry than Americans,” Miller said about H-1B visa holders.
Since Trump took office, USCIS has released several memos and directives that take a stringent view of who is eligible for work visas. In the past, a qualified applicant with a bachelor’s degree related to their “specialty occupation” could reliably get an H-1B. Yet in a memo issued in March 2017, USCIS made it harder for people with relevant degrees to get H-1B visas, particularly computer programmers. Another memo instructed USCIS officers to look at every H-1B petition as if it was being evaluated it for the first time, even if the applicant had been approved in the past.
Together, the two memos have changed the rules of the game for H-1Bs. Jobs that routinely counted as specialty occupations, such as computer systems analysts, no longer easily qualify for H-1Bs. Many visa holders who have lived in the United States for years are suddenly vulnerable because they may not qualify for a visa that they have received many times in the past.
Bruce Morrison, a former Congress member from Connecticut who co-sponsored the Immigration Act of 1990, which established the H-1B program, says the administration’s actions violate the spirit of the program. “Attacking legal immigration is kind of a stealth strategy,” he says. “It’s one in which people who are just listening to the news are easily seduced into thinking this is all about protecting the border or protecting our security or making sure the people who are here are here legally. But in fact this is a wholesale isolationist administration. It doesn’t like anything that isn’t stamped ‘Made in America,’ whether it’s the individuals or whether it’s the products.”
The rising rate of appeals and reversals of decisions suggests that the officials who examine H-1B applications have been struggling to make sense of the stricter policies. Lynden Melmed, the former chief counsel at USCIS during the Bush administration, believes the Trump administration has intentionally given the agency’s officers more leeway by removing some of the guardrails that had once ensured consistent decisions. Hundreds of pages of USCIS documents uncovered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit reveal that more than one year after the new rules were announced, USCIS officers and staff still had many unanswered questions. In an email sent in May 2018, an adjudications officer acknowledged these concerns, noting that “more detailed guidance related to this issue” was still being drafted.
Experts say the administration’s new policies misapply the established definitions of the specialty occupations that qualify for H-1Bs. “The statutes and regulations set forth have very clear criteria on who qualifies as a specialty occupation,” says Diane Rish, associate director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “The agency wouldn’t apply the regulation correctly and erroneously denied applications, whether it’s the fault of training or an analysis not properly done.”
A USCIS spokesperson noted in an emailed statement that only 1 percent of all H-1B denials are appealed and that the appeals office still sides with USCIS in a majority of cases. He said the overall trends are in line “with a series of agency reforms designed to protect U.S. workers, cut down on frivolous petitions, strengthen the transparency of employment-based visa programs, and improve the integrity of the immigration petition process.”
Legal scholars wonder how long the appeals office will continue to side with H-1B applicants. “It’ll be interesting to see, if the [appeals office] has been serving as a check, how the administration will react to that,” says Jill Family, a law professor at Widener University who focuses on immigration law. Employers who don’t agree with the H-1B rejections don’t have to file appeals with the USCIS. They can also challenge the agency’s decisions in federal court, and experts say more are doing so than in the past. “It’s hard to say if this is a one-year flip in the data or an actual trend,” says Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration at Cornell University. “It remains to be seen whether that continues or whether the [appeals office] also starts to toe the administration line and goes back up to the 90 percent level of agreeing with the initial denials.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, tweeted that she was “sickened to see Trump’s gross misappropriation of this term today.”
So much of the history of lynching is the history of its misappropriation as a metaphor by powerful white people. President Richard Nixon was said to have been beset by the “lynch-mob mentality” of the Senate committee tasked with investigating Watergate. Robert Bork, a white Supreme Court nominee, and Charles Pickering, a white federal court nominee, were said to have faced a lynching in their losing confirmation fights. The judge presiding over the trial for the militantly white Timothy McVeigh decided to limit emotional testimony from survivors and victims’ relatives in the Oklahoma City bombing, lest the penalty phase of the trial become “some kind of lynching.” (The New York Times adjudged this “an essential and admirable step.”) In 1998, white Joe Biden wondered if white Bill Clinton’s impeachment was just a “partisan lynching.” In 2011, white conservative pundit Glenn Beck felt so threatened by the harassment of moviegoers in New York that he worried they would “lynch” him.
Amy Kate Bailey, a sociology professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and co-author of Lynched: The Victims of Southern Mob Violence, sees a pattern of powerful men making the “interesting and problematic rhetorical move” of claiming to be the targets of lynchings. America’s lynching regime “was systematically inflicted as a form of violent terror,” Bailey told me. To use it as “a means of deflecting criticism and deflecting culpability for people who have access to lots of power”—and to the due process provisions of the legal system— is to contribute to what she called “a false narrative about the history of racist mob violence in the United States.”
From the mid-1800s through the early 20th century, lynching was an instrument of racial control, devastating Black men, women, and children in the South—and beyond. Close to 4,000 people were brutally beaten, drowned, burned alive, maimed, and tortured during that time period, according to E.M Beck, an emeritus professor at the University of Georgia and co-author of A Festival of Violence: An Analysis of Southern Lynchings 1882-1930. The NAACP, which called Trump’s comments a “repugnant show of ignorance,” pegs the number of lynchings between 1882 and 1968 at just over 4,700; nearly 73 percent of victims were Black. In a report titled “Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror,” the Equal Justice Initiative found that a quarter of Black lynching victims had been accused of sexual assault, while 30 percent had been accused of murder. These allegations were often pretexts to inflict terror on Black people, and by definition, the punishments were meted out with no due process.
“We’re talking about some brutal things going on. Given that as the historical context, to have politicians come up and use that term that politicians are an insult to the victims of lynchings,” Beck told me. Jonathan Markovitz, an attorney at the ACLU in San Diego, noted that Trump is using “lynching” in a context—impeachment—in which he is being afforded all the formal protections of due process. “People were lynched not only when there were no trials but when nobody even thought that a crime was committed,” Markovitz said. “This rendering of that history divorces it from meaning and suffering.”
From the start, lynching functioned as more than a material act of violence, Markovitz argues in his book Legacies of Lynching: Racial Violence and Memory; it was a message to Black people in general. To anti-lynching advocates, lynching represented “white supremacist barbarism,” the violent expression of “an entire system of power”—a sort of metonym for racism writ large. Through the 1920s, Bailey told me, lynching was considered a “palpable reality,” especially for Black men, though Black women were no less terrorized by repressive violence, with the threat of rape acting in roughly analogous fashion to the prospect of lynching.
As the pace of lynchings declined over time, the meanings ascribed to the term began to loosen and multiply. With the expansion of the prison system, the term “legal lynching” emerged to “say that this one system of racist terrorism has been transformed into another,” Markovitz told me. Protesters notably used it to describe the series of convictions and retrials of the Scottsboro Boys, nine Black teenagers who were falsely accused in 1931 of raping two white women. Their convictions were later overturned, setting a legal precedent buttressing the right to counsel.
But the concept could also be put to reactionary use, and not just on behalf of powerful white political figures. Most famously, Clarence Thomas, on the first day of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, said he was the victim of a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks,” explicitly pitting the legacy of American racial atrocity against a Black woman’s claims of sexual victimization. As Markovitz noted, Thomas wanted to draw people’s attention to the historical resonances of white spectators investigating Black sexuality (though not to the fact that Black men didn’t get lynched for their supposed crimes against Black women). Years later, Ann Coulter used the same phrase, “high-tech lynching,” as she defended former Republican presidential contender and pizza magnate Herman Cain from sexual harassment allegations. That tactic, of countering allegations of sexual impropriety by invoking America’s history of racist vigilantism, was more recently employed by Bill Cosby, whose legal team called his trial a “public lynching,” and R. Kelly, who called the #MuteRKelly campaign against him an “attempted public lynching of a black man.” And in February, in a speech to Virginia senators, the state’s lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, brushed off calls for his resignation in the face of accusations of sexual assault by two women, essentially comparing himself to lynching victims.
Today, the idea of lynching is very much contested ground, as Trump in his oafishness has demonstrated. “Yes, African Americans were lynched, other people have people lynched throughout history,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in defending the president. “What does lynching mean? That a mob grabs you, they don’t give you a chance to defend yourself, they don’t tell you what happened to you, they just destroy you.” On the right, the meaning of lynching now occludes the actual victims of the practice in favor of powerful people who fear dispossession of one kind or another. These are people who “make claims of disempowerment that are not true in the way they were true [for people who] were publicly and brutally murdered by their own neighbors,” Bailey said.
“That’s not what’s happening to Donald Trump. That’s not what happened to Clarence Thomas. I’m not saying they aren’t feeling a feeling of being under attack. The question is how appropriate it is to try to make claims of a status and level of victimhood that’s just not true.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

He Didn’t Give Her the Whole Truth.,Ali Breland,MotherJones,Politics,"During his congressional testimony on Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to side-step responsibility for partnering with the conservative media site, the Daily Caller, giving an at-best misleading answer to a pretty direct question from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).
Ocasio-Cortez asked Zuckerberg why Facebook partnered with “the Daily Caller, a publication well-documented with ties to white supremacists, as an official fact-checker for Facebook.” Her question refers to the organization’s history of employing people like Scott Greer, a deputy editor who had previously written for a white supremacist publication, and of running articles from prominent white supremacists like Jason Kessler and Peter Brimelow.
“We actually don’t appoint the independent fact-checkers,” Zuckerberg responded. “They go through an independent organization called the Independent Fact-Checking Network, that has a rigorous standard for who they allow to serve as a fact-checker.”
“So you would say that white supremacist-tied publications meet a rigorous standard for fact-checking?” she asked skeptically.
Zuckerberg again dodged, once more deferring to the outside organization.

While the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), a unit of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, does make determinations as to who makes it into the pool of Facebook’s fact-checkers, the platform makes its own choices about which IFCN organizations actually get to fact-check the articles shared—a detail  Zuckerberg conveniently left out.*
Vox’s Aaron Rupar explained the Facebook fact-checking process back in May:
What’s particularly interesting about Zuckerberg neglecting to mention Facebook’s responsibility here is that, according to the Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg was directly involved in discussions with Facebook vice president and former George W. Bush staffer Joel Kaplan about whether or not to include the Daily Caller:
So yes, Facebook doesn’t accredit its fact-checkers, but, as Zuckerberg knows, it does pick them.
Correction: The original version of this article misstated the IFCN’s name.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In an exclusive interview with Mother Jones last week in Dubuque, Iowa, she promised to mobilize the Department of Justice and the EPA to ensure “that we’re going to put pressure on the big companies to do what is required and what is responsible.”
Asked if the federal government should play a role in investigating fossil fuel companies, Harris said “absolutely,” adding “let’s get them not only in the pocket book, but let’s make sure there are severe and serious penalties for their behaviors.”
One of those companies, Harris suggested, could be California’s largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). Earlier this month, PG&E cut the power to an estimated two million people in an effort to minimize its chances of causing a catastrophic fire; last year’s Camp Fire killed 86 people and tipped PG&E into bankruptcy. In recent years, PG&E has invested heavily in renewables, but from 1989 to 1991, the utility was part of the campaign to delay and derail climate action through the Global Climate Coalition, a group of industry groups that worked to delay and derail regulation through 2002.
“Everyone that was part of misinforming the public, misleading the public, and false advertising should be held accountable,” she says. “There is, in my vision of the future, a very important role for utilities to play in being held accountable.”
This was the first time Harris has weighed in on the utility’s role after power shut-offs in her home state. In the climate plan she released in September, she promised to flip the switch on Trump-era environmental rollbacks, then implement her own brand of the Green New Deal, a $10 trillion investment plan to equip the country for a carbon-neutral future—she hopes by 2045.
The senator has a less substantial environmental record than some opponents—most notably Bernie Sanders—but she has spoken out about the importance of cleaning up pollution in poor communities. Her Climate Equity Act would assign a score to bills and regulations that judges their impacts on vulnerable places.
Harris has also been sure to emphasize her experience as a prosecutor, when she oversaw the California Department of Justice. From 2011 to 2017, her office sued several major oil and gas companies for pollution. But last month, during a climate change town hall, Harris claimed to have directed the California Attorney General’s office to sue Exxon Mobil in 2016 for misleading the public about the dangers of climate change. In fact, the department only opened an investigation that eventually went nowhere.
The litigation over climate denial and who bears responsibility is still an open question: Exxon is currently on trial in the New York Supreme Court over whether it misled shareholders over climate change impacts, and the Supreme Court will allow the city of Baltimore’s case against major oil companies to proceed in state court. These cases and others could persist well into the next administration.
And for that reason, Harris says that she will choose her cabinet members in part based on their commitment to fighting climate change—even for positions outside the EPA. “The president of the United States gets to appoint her cabinet,” she says. “And for me this issue of the climate crisis relates to every aspect of what we do.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But the former New York City mayor isn’t the only lawyer for Trump who has become involved in a US foreign policy matter. Last year, Jay Sekulow, while serving as a personal attorney for Trump, was in repeated contact with a prominent lobbyist who was pushing to help Turkey’s national bank avoid prosecution by the Justice Department for its alleged role in a scheme to evade US sanctions on Iran.
In foreign lobbying disclosures filed with the Justice Department last year, Brian Ballard—who runs a high-powered firm that represented both the government of Turkey and its national bank—revealed that he had exchanged phone calls and text messages with Sekulow on six occasions between July and October 2018. At the time, Sekulow was busy defending Trump against special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. But Sekulow says he wasn’t speaking for Trump in his conversations with Ballard. Rather, he says, he was involved in the exchanges because his nonprofit organization, the American Center for Law a Justice, was representing pro bono Andrew Brunson, a pastor who was imprisoned in Turkey in 2016 and released on October 12, 2018.
Ballard’s filing lists the purpose of his conversations with Sekulow as “US-Turkey relations” and identifies Sekulow not as the president’s lawyer, but as chief counsel for the ACLJ, which works on evangelical causes. The filling doesn’t specify whether Ballard was acting on behalf of Turkey, its national bank, or both.
The communication occurred at a time when Ballard and other lobbyists at his firm were pressing the White House, the State Department, and Congress to ask the Justice Department not to prosecute the Turkish bank—known as Halkbank—over allegations that could result in heavy fines. Halkbank is accused of using front companies to help Iran evade US sanctions related to oil and gas sales and financial transactions. Ballard also sought to protect the bank from possible Treasury Department penalties.
“We made the case over a period of a year or more to the US government that in considering the case of Halkbank, it was important to remember that they are a NATO ally and the bank was very important to their financial system and their economy and that needed to be taken into account in any decision that was made,” Jamie Rubin, a former State Department spokesman who now works for Ballard told Mother Jones.
Courthouse News reported earlier this week on Ballard’s lobbying effort for Halkbank and his contacts with Sekulow.
In interviews with Mother Jones, Sekulow said he had only a limited recollection of his contacts with Ballard, but he noted that the lobbyist had spoken with him at a time when Brunson was extremely ill and his advocates were especially eager to secure his freedom. “He had lost like 65 pounds,” Sekulow said. “I wanted to make sure our guy was alive.”
Asked if Ballard hoped to arrange a deal linking Brunson and Halkbank, Sekulow said he had no memory of Ballard even mentioning the Turkish bank. “If it had come up, I wouldn’t know how to respond to it,” Sekulow said, adding that he had no power to influence US policy toward Turkey and did not participate in any negotiations over what the United States might offer Turkey in exchange for Brunson’s freedom. “I never spoke to the Justice Department about it or any agency that could be involved in that kind of thing,” Sekulow said.
During the same period, Sekulow was also representing Trump, who took a personal interest in Brunson’s case. Sekulow said he discussed the pastor’s plight frequently with the president and also spoke about the issue on multiple occasions with Vice President Mike Pence, who was involved in the negotiations over Brunson’s fate. In July 2018, Trump tweeted a threat to “impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long time detainment” of Brunson. The following month, Trump doubled steel and aluminum tariffs on Turkey, and the Treasury Department sanctioned two Turkish officials over the Brunson matter.
On October 11, 2018, NBC News, citing unnamed administration officials, reported that Brunson was being freed as part of a “secret deal” that included “a commitment by the US to ease economic pressure on Turkey.” The next day, a Turkish court convicted Brunson on charges of supporting terrorism but sentenced him to time served and ordered him released. Brunson’s return home may have boosted Trump’s standing with evangelical Christians, a key group of supporters for the president. Trump boasted about it at a campaign rally hours after Brunson was freed and then hosted the pastor at the White House, where Brunson prayed for Trump as cameras rolled.
Two people involved in the talks over Halkbank told Mother Jones that there was no firm agreement linking Brunson to Halkbank’s case, but that Brunson’s release, by improving relations between the US and Turkey, helped the bank make its case to the administration.
“The entire Halkbank context was in terms of freeing Pastor Brunson,” one of those sources said. “If Pastor Brunson was freed, then there would be great incentive on both the American and Turkish side to improve relations.”
Brian Ballard did not respond to questions emailed to an assistant.
Brunson’s 2016 arrest came in the aftermath of a failed coup attempt against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. As part of a massive roundup of Erdogan’s perceived enemies, Brunson was accused of crimes that included supporting the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, which Turkey considers a terrorist group. Brunson denied the allegations, which were widely viewed as politically motivated.
In 2017, Erdogan pushed for a swap in which Turkey would free Brunson in exchange for the US extraditing Fetullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. Erdogan accuses Gulen of encouraging the coup attempt, which was carried out by alleged Gulen adherents in Turkey’s armed forces.
Giuliani in 2017 also urged Trump to hand Gulen over to Turkey, the Washington Post reported last week. Those conversations reportedly occurred around the time Giuliani was representing Reza Zarrab, a Turkish citizen prosecuted for evading US sanctions on Iran. Giuliani reportedly pressed Rex Tillerson, then the secretary of State, to ask the Justice Department to drop its probe into Zarrab in exchange for Brunson’s return. Zarrab later agreed to plead guilty and cooperated with investigators, providing information they ultimately used to make a case against Halkbank and individual Turkish officials involved in the alleged scheme. After his plea, it was Halkbank, not Zarrab, that Erdogan wanted out of the Justice Department’s crosshairs.
According to Bloomberg, Erdogan repeatedly brought up the bank in calls with Trump, who told Erdogan that Attorney General William Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin would handle the issue. Trump asked Barr and Mnuchin to work with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the matter, the news organization reported.
Lobbyists for Turkey, including Ballard and King & Spalding, a law firm, were also on the case. Ballard, who has turned his longstanding relationship with Trump into a thriving practice in Washington, met on July 24, 2018, with Pence’s then-chief of staff, Nick Ayers. The vice president, who functions as Trump’s emissary to evangelicals, had a key role in attempting to negotiate Brunson’s release. Ballard was in contact with Ayers and Pence aide Matthew Morgan in the weeks prior to Brunson’s release.
Ballard also employed former Rep. Robert Wexler (D-Fla.), former Senate aide Rebecca Benn, and, later, Rubin to press Congress and the State Department on Halkbank’s behalf. Ballard and Wexler met with Wess Mitchell, then the assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs, on the same day Ballard met with Ayers.
Whatever Ballard gained for Halkbank was undercut three weeks ago, after the infamous phone call in which Trump indicated that Erdogan could go ahead with an invasion of northern Syrian. The move drew a furious response from members of both US political parties. The White House responded by scrambling to negotiate a cease fire and announcing sanctions on Turkey.
The next day, Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, unveiled a six-count indictment of Halkbank for “fraud, money laundering, and sanctions offenses related to the bank’s participation in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade US sanctions on Iran.” Berman did not tie the prosecution to the Syrian invasion. A spokesman for the office declined to respond to questions about whether Barr or other administration officials had previously asked Berman to hold off on prosecuting the bank.

His refusal to divest himself from his business empire means that individuals, corporations, and foreign powers seeking to influence the Trump administration or buy goodwill from the president can pump money directly into Trump’s pockets through his businesses. By visiting his collection of hotels and golf resorts at taxpayer expense—which he has done 387 times during his presidency so far—he has promoted his properties. And Trump has business interests in the United States and around the globe where American economic and foreign policies can have a direct impact on the president’s bottom line.
Trump’s now-abandoned plan to hold the G7 at the Doral—effectively forcing foreign governments to pay him to attend the conference—was perhaps the most egregious case of Trump using his office to advance his personal interests. Yet Trump’s presidency remains riddled with conflicts, big and small.
In light of the ongoing crisis in Syria, Trump’s most pressing conflict of interest at the moment may be the two gleaming towers in downtown Istanbul that bear his name. As is typical for many of his overseas projects, Trump Towers Istanbul is a licensing deal. The property’s owner, Turkish billionaire Aydın Doğan, has a contract to pay Trump annual royalties to use the Trump name. Trump has earned between $3.2 million and $17 million from the project since it opened in 2012, according to his personal financial disclosures. Last year, he made as much as $1 million from the venture.
Because Trump doesn’t own the towers, his name can easily be removed—and his income cut off. That’s not a theoretical threat. In 2015, when then-candidate Trump disparaged Muslims and proposed banning them from entering the United States, both Doğan and Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to remove Trump’s name from the towers. The  episode showed that Erdogan is not afraid to use the property as leverage. As Trump himself conceded in a 2015 interview: “I have a little conflict of interest cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul.”
It has been more than a year since the Saudi government orchestrated the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist and US resident, likely at the behest of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump was remarkably soft on the issue, refusing to condemn the prince and praising MBS’s father as “a fine man.” Why soft-pedal? He provided a clue at a 2015 campaign rally. “Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them,” Trump said. “They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much.”
In 2001, Trump sold the 45th floor of Trump World Tower, across the street from the United Nations, to the Saudi government. More recently, when MBS visited New York last year, part of his entourage stayed at a Trump hotel that saw its struggling revenue numbers surge thanks to the visit.
Then there’s a mysterious project Trump considered launching in Saudi Arabia amid his presidential campaign. In August 2015—on the same day Trump bragged about his condo sales to Saudis—he incorporated a handful of companies with names that suggested he was trying to open a hotel project in Jeddah, the Saudi city that serves as gateway to the Muslim holy sites of Mecca and Medina. Because economic activity in the kingdom is closely controlled by the Saudi royal family, Trump had likely partnered with a well-connected Saudi. The project never came to fruition, and it remains unknown whom Trump was working with in the kingdom—or whether he has plans to revive the venture one day.
Before taking office, Trump promised he would undertake no new international projects to avoid any conflicts of interest with foreign governments. But this did not apply to projects in various stages of development, such as two Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia built by a local media and real estate tycoon named Hary Tanoesoedibjo.
Like Trump, Tanoesoedibjo had political ambitions. He floated a presidential bid in 2014. And in 2015—the same year that Trump partnered with Tanoesoedibjo—the Indonesian developer founded his own political party, the Indonesian Unity Party, saying he was inspired by his relationship with Trump. Tanoesoedibjo has already paid Trump between $2 million and $10 million in royalties for the use of Trump’s name, along with $591,000 in hotel management fees. This spring, Trump sold one of his Los Angeles mansions to Tanoesoedibjo for $13.5 million.
Tanoesoedibjo has bragged about his access to Trump. “If other people have difficulty getting to him, I can do it easily,” he remarked in 2017.
Trump’s flagship Scottish golf course, Turnberry, is iconic—but not profitable. It struggled for years to make money before Trump bought it for $60 million in 2014. Since then, Trump has poured tens of millions into the property and racked up more than $58 million in losses. Turnberry’s remote location means that it is reliant on a small nearby small airport that, aside from being an occasional stopover point for American flight crews traveling to and from Europe, doesn’t get much business. But since Trump was elected, the airport has seen an increase in stopovers and fuel sales to American military flights, and air crews have been shuttled out to Trump’s resort for their overnight stays—a curious move since there are numerous hotels that are both closer to the airport and cheaper. Congressional Democrats investigating the matter have uncovered at least $184,000 in expenditures by the US Air Force at Turnberry, raising the question of whether the US government is subsidizing Trump’s struggling golf club.
Trump’s DC hotel is a monument to the convergence of Trump’s political and business interests. It serves as a kind of clubhouse for DC Republicans and has become a destination for foreign delegations seeking the attention of the White House. Conflicts of interest are practically the glue that holds it together.
To start with, the building the hotel occupies, an old federal post office, is owned by the government, making Trump both the property’s leaseholder and landlord. (The General Services Administration, the federal agency that oversees the property and whose leaders report to Trump, determined this arrangement posed no conflict.)
Starting even before Trump’s inauguration, lobbyists, conservative activists, and foreign dignitaries began descending on the hotel, with some foreign diplomats openly saying they were patronizing the property to win favor with Trump. As we reported:
The hotel has spawned a string of lawsuits over just how much foreign governments are spending at the hotel—the Trump Organization and the White House refuse to say—and whether that spending violates the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officeholders from accepting payments or gifts from foreign governments.
Trump has visited the hotel least 23 times since taking office, according to watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Members of his administration have visited the hotel at least 389 times. Meanwhile, Republican campaigns and PACs, including the president’s own reelection campaign, have spent at least $570,000 at the hotel over the course of 229 visits.
For Trump, the ultimate problem may be that he still sees himself as businessman—as opposed to a commander-in-chief whose actions should be free from questions about whether they are being taken with personal gain in mind. On this front, Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s acting chief of staff, made a revealing comment while trying to clean up the mess from the announcement that Trump was going to bring the G7 to Doral. “He was honestly surprised at the level of pushback,” Mulvaney said, adding, “At the end of the day, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Bernie Sanders hails the idea—which would expand the federal government’s health care insurance program for the elderly to everyone and replace private insurance—as part of the political “revolution” he champions. Elizabeth Warren, who has endorsed Sanders’ plan, has been pressed at multiple debates by moderators and other Democratic contenders to acknowledge it would raise taxes on middle-income Americans (while, in theory, lowering their health care costs by a greater amount). Her refusal to do so has drawn criticism and barbs, as her Democratic rivals, including Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, have questioned the total cost of such a program and decried the notion of taking away existing insurance from the two-thirds of Americans who have private health care plans. Recently, Sen. Sherrod Brown, the feisty Democratic populist from Ohio, who opted not to join the 2020 fray, noted, “It’ll be a hard sell to the public if we go into the general election for ‘Medicare for all.’” He cited the risk of alienating union workers who would lose their plans.
Whether they know it or not, the Democrats, on this front, are really fighting over economic theory, and the bad news for progressives is that social science research is not on the side of those calling for sweeping and immediate change in an industry that makes up about one-fifth of the US economy.
The traditional arguments against Medicare for All are hardly surprising: a gargantuan price tag, expanding government power (socialism!), widespread disruption, and so on. A big change to the status quo—especially a system that is profitable for many—will draw big opposition from the established order. But it does not take a rocket scientist—or a neuroscientist—to understand a basic dynamic that could put off voters. This proposal promises great benefits—no co-payments, no deductibles, low-priced medication, and more—in return for higher taxes, with the financial gains for consumers surpassing the cost of the tax hike. Yet it is not difficult to imagine that many voters will assume that the government will raise taxes (it certainly knows how to do that) but wonder if the government will be able to deliver on the promises of lower health costs and better treatment. (Progressives have long had to contend with an internal conflict in their overall message: Government is a corrupt institution shaped by corporate interests, and the power of government should be widened to address social ills.) And if a known quantity (your existing health care insurance, as imperfect as it may be) is going to be taken away and replaced by an unknown (the promised better system), many voters may be hesitant to make the swap. The devil you know and all that.
This mindset is a fundamental aspect of human nature, according to the pioneering work of behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. In 1979, the two developed what’s known as the prospect theory. It’s one of the first economic theories derived from actual experiments, and it challenged the basic notion advanced by classical economists that people evaluate decisions in a pure gain-versus-loss manner. No, Kahneman and Tversky said, after conducting a series of studies with people: Human beings are not that rational—or, that is, not rational in that way. People assess loss and gain in an asymmetric fashion. And that’s a problem for Medicare for All advocates.
In his marvelous 2011 book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2002, notes that “loss aversion” has an outsize impact on a person’s decisions: “When directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains.” So the prospect of losing what you have (say, your existing insurance) weighs heavier than the prospect of obtaining something better (no-cost insurance that supposedly will cover more). Kahneman explains there is a sound reason for this: “This asymmetry between the power of positive and negative expectations or experiences has an evolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.” Bottom line: We’re generally hardwired more to worry than to hope.
Kahneman and Tversky created what Kahneman calls a “flag” for their prospect theory with this chart:

The vertical axis measures the psychological value of the loss or gain, and it demonstrates that losses affect us more greatly than gains. “The response to losses is stronger than the response to corresponding gains,” Kahneman notes in Thinking, Fast and Slow. And he adds that “loss aversion rates” are “usually in the range of 1.5 to 2.5,” meaning the possible gain has to be worth 1.5 to 2.5 times as much of the possible loss for a choice to be seen as an even bet. And that’s when the two possibilities can be clearly articulated.
“Many of the options we face in life are ‘mixed’: there is a risk of loss and an opportunity for gain, and we must decide whether to accept the gamble or reject it,” Kahneman writes in his book. Medicare for All fits that bill for many. For those Americans with no health insurance coverage or with the crappiest plans, there will be little or no loss aversion. But a large majority of Americans are being asked to forego what they have for the promise of a plan that is supposedly better for them—and the nation at large. It’s understandable that when the choice is presented this way, they may be less than eager to dive in. Kahneman and Tversky’s theory shows why. (There’s another element not covered by the theory that is also crucial: Whether voters have confidence that whoever is proposing this radical restructuring has the ability to make it happen and then make it work. A voter can love Sanders’ plan but question whether he has the skills necessary to get it through Congress and guide the federal government to implement it effectively.)
The prospect theory is not the be-all and end-all. Kahneman notes it has flaws. For instance, it fails “to allow for regret.” But it does illustrate a problem faced by Medicare for All fans and those who would make this idea a litmus test for candidates or progressives at large. A candidate who champions a proposal that removes an existing benefit faces an uphill battle. Which is why polling shows that a plan that expands Medicare to cover people who want it and that does not force Americans with private insurance into a public health insurance system is more popular (at 67 percent in one recent poll) than the Sanders-style Medicare for All that eliminates private insurance (at 56 percent). And keep in mind, such polling has occurred in an atmosphere in which the mandatory loss of your private insurance is just starting to become an issue in the Democratic campaign. Though the health care discussion during the recent Democratic debates has frequently been chaotic and confusing, Sanders’ and Warren’s foes have tried to zero in on this aspect of the plan. (Warren recently announced she would within weeks release her own health insurance plan.) And it’s easy to conceive of a campaign that could be whipped up against a Democratic candidate advocating Medicare for All that hammers on the well-defined loss and questions the possible gain. The forces behind such an attack—Donald Trump, Republicans, corporate interests, Big Insurance—would be, whether they know it or not, relying on the prospect theory.
Remember how President Barack Obama claimed the Affordable Care Act would allow consumers, if they like their doctors and plans, to keep them? That turned out to be not entirely true—and he was mightily slammed for that. Many of the large and small social reforms that have succeeded in the United States—Medicare, Social Security, the Children’s Health Insurance Program—provided new and additional benefits to American citizens, without taking anything away. Medicare for All does both. That doesn’t mean that the trade-off (ending private insurance in return for a national public system) is bad. But this grand deal does create a political burden for those promoting this reform.
Selling massive and immediate transformation is a tough job—especially when it requires people to give up what they already possess and have become accustomed to. It’s incumbent on any would-be reformer to have a clear-eyed understanding of how voters will process the choice. A good idea is not enough. Neither is a bold promise. The numbers have to be convincing—and the psychology, too. Hope, optimism, passion, and public interest values can all be called into action. But Medicare for All proponents must realize that the arc of human decision-making seems to bend toward loss aversion—and that means they will need to find their way up this steep slope.

The litigation, which the city initiated in 2018, alleges that the energy companies are liable “for their direct emissions of greenhouse gases” and the damages they’ve caused the city and its residents.
No explanation accompanied the Supreme Court rejection, but Baltimore is considering it a victory, since its case against companies including BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell, and Citgo can now continue. Though the ultimate decision of where the case should be heard may end up being more significant than the high court ruling.
The energy companies’ request to halt the case is part of their broader legal fight to move the case from state to federal court. The companies hope to establish a precedent in which climate cases are largely heard by federal courts, where “climate-related cases have been largely decided in the companies’ favor,” reports Climate Liability News. In a recent article on the Supreme Court’s rejection of the freeze, New York Times columnist Adam Liptak points out that cases in state courts disadvantage big corporations because cities have a “home-court advantage before local judges.”
The strategy of choice among big energy companies is to appeal to the federal courts—in this case the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals—that its cases belong there, then request a stay on the state case while the appeal is decided, citing the costliness of multiple concurrent cases. The recent New York Times article elaborates on the one-two punch:
It’s not the first time the energy companies have tried to remove the case from a state court. In June, a federal court in Baltimore ruled that the defendants’ attempt to push the case out of local courts was “improper.” A similar request lodged to the circuit court while it still decides on the legitimacy of the defendants’ appeal was also denied.
With the appellate court still deciding if the case can be elevated to the federal level, the final arena is undecided. If the battle between Baltimore and the energy companies remains in a local court, the implications for future cases are substantial, paving the way for court battles with energy companies at the local level.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

One thing that I’ve been reporting on a bit lately is the crazy Crowdstrike conspiracy theory that President Trump apparently believes. To recap: When the White House released its account of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, people were scratching their heads at Trump’s request that his counterpart “find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike…the server, they say Ukraine has it.”
Crowdstirke, a California-based cybersecurity firm, has been a particular focus of Trump’s since at least early 2017 when, in an interview scheduled to mark his hundredth day in office, he aired thoroughly debunked conspiracy theories suggesting that the company was part of some plot to hide who really hacked the Democratic National Committee. Although the US intelligence community has concluded Russia was responsible, if someone else had done it, it would dispel a cloud hanging over his 2016 election and undermine a key rationale that animated special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Even though his former senior advisers have told him it’s not true, and his own Department of Justice has said it’s not true, the theory hangs on with the president and his supporters in Congress, two of whom brought it up in an election security hearing this week.
The president cared enough about the theory to include it in the broader push for Ukrainian investigations that now imperils his presidency. But are his supporters anywhere near as interested? While I was downtown, I asked a few Trump supporters demonstrating on the president’s behalf outside the event about Crowdstrike, to find out. And in short, they’re not.
Joe Herman of Pittsburgh told me that “there’s lots of issues concerning the whole horizon of what’s going on in this country politically and socially… I wouldn’t say it’s one of the big, main focal points among Trump supporters that I’ve heard.”
Randy Rodosky, a Trump supporter from Munhall, Pennsylvania, claimed he’d heard about it “on basic news, and I’ve heard it on Fox News.” But when I asked him for details he didn’t have any, and instead performed a familiar pivot. “What Hillary Clinton did was absolutely beyond excuse, and that’s all I can say. I don’t think Trump did anything wrong…Hillary Clinton’s 30,000 deleted emails tell it all.”
“I don’t really know anything about computers,” said one man I spoke to about the Crowdstrike theory. That may have been true, but the next thing he told me illustrated the value of the president’s conspiracies, even if his supporters don’t grasp the details: “I do definitely believe that he wouldn’t have brought it up if there wasn’t something there.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Trump publicly called on China to investigate the matter—just days before the US and China were set to resume high-stakes trade talks. Trump ultimately announced that he’d reached a partial trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping. On Thursday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro declined to tell CNN whether the Trump administration brought up the Bidens during the negotiations.

“You don’t have a right to know what happens behind closed doors in the administration,” Navarro told CNN’s Jim Sciutto.
Sciutto followed up, asking, “Did you bring up investigating the Bidens as part of the negotiations?”
“You’re asking me what happens in the White House behind closed doors,” Navarro replied.

In the settlement, the state of South Dakota has agreed to not enforce provisions of the law that dole out felonies and create costly fines for people who “encourage” riots without participating. Like other states, South Dakota law defines “riot” broadly enough to include some forms of peaceful protest.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem described the “riot-boosting” law passed earlier this year as a “next-generation pipeline funding model” designed to “address issues caused by out-of-state rioters…that have attacked nearby projects,” alluding to protests in North Dakota that impeded construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016. The “riot-boosting” law would have allowed the state to sue people and organizations who encourage such protests, even if they never join one, or live in other states.
In a suit filed in March with the US District Court in South Dakota, the ACLU (representing local farmers, ranchers, and Indigenous groups) held that this law would “chill” free speech and peaceful protests by creating a heavy deterrent—penalties of up to three times the cost of damages incurred—for any statement that can be so much as linked to behavior the state construes as violent.
As I reported back in June,
South Dakota’s agreement to not enforce these laws comes on the heels of a federal judge issuing a temporary injunction that blocked provisions of the “riot-boosting” law. In his decision, the judge wrote that the law was likely unconstitutional, and suggested that Martin Luther King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference “could have been liable” had a “riot-boosting” law existed during their protests in Birmingham, Alabama.
While this spells victory for activists in South Dakota, a slew of other states have recently passed similar laws criminalizing various forms of protest, especially those which target oil and gas projects. As construction of Keystone XL gets underway in South Dakota and Montana, a number of states through which the pipeline would pass, such as North Dakota and Texas, have hiked their penalties for protesting near “critical infrastructure,” threatening felonies with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $10,000 (or $100,000 for organizations). Many of those laws mirror language put forth by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which is affiliated with many oil companies, including TransCanada. Two women are currently facing up to 110 years in prison after admitting to acts of sabotage that targeted the Dakota Access Pipeline.
These laws are widely opposed by Indigenous groups, who have led many recent challenges to fossil fuel infrastructure. Under an anti-protest law passed last year in Louisiana, Anne White Hat, a Sicangu Lakota single mother, is currently being charged with two felonies and up to 10 years in prison for allegedly trespassing on a pipeline easement. White Hat is the lead plaintiff in a different federal suit challenging the constitutionality of the Louisiana law.
In a statement, Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the plaintiffs in the South Dakota case, said that he and his allies “will celebrate this win, but remain vigilant against further government attempts to outlaw our right to peacefully assemble.

There’s both good news and bad news here. The bad new is obvious: it’s hard to know which seemingly race-neutral metrics might, in fact, rely indirectly on race. In this case, by using dollar amounts, the algorithm favored white patients who are generally more affluent and spend more on health care to begin with.
The good news is a little more subtle, but still genuinely good. The alternative to algorithms, of course, is human judgment. But human judgment also tends to be racist, even among those who have only the best intentions. The difference is that it’s really hard—close to impossible in many cases—to change human behavior in the short or medium term. So the racism continues even if we know it’s there.
With a computer algorithm, however, careful study can often identify biases—and once those biases are uncovered, they can be fixed. In this case, developers are already at work on a better algorithm. Compare that to the years and years it would take to fight human racism with bias training and diversity programs and so forth, with no guarantee even then of success.
So two cheers for the algorithm revolution. Digital algorithms aren’t perfect, but they’re a damn sight better than most wetware algorithms.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) affirmed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, saying “what he has already admitted to is an impeachable offense.”

Surrounded by a flurry of reporters, the New York Democrat was asked if the caucus had been too slow to move on impeachment. Ocasio-Cortez didn’t take the bait: “We can’t ask ourselves about whether we move too slow or too quickly. We have to ask ourselves what we’re doing right now.”

Mere days after the Democratic firebrand called out her own party for abetting the president’s continued behavior, Ocasio-Cortez lent her support to the Speaker’s decision: “I think we have to hold this president accountable and we have to protect our democracy.”

Is It Evolving Fast Enough?,Daniel King,MotherJones,Media,"One of the standout essays in About Us, a collection of essays about disabilities, first published in the New York Times, is starkly titled “The Nazis’ First Victims Were the Disabled.” Many of the killing methods used in the Holocaust were first tested on about 300,000 people with disabilities as part of Nazi Germany’s “Aktion T4” project. People with disabilities were depicted as “useless eaters” whose lives were “unworthy of living” in propaganda like the 1941 film Ich Klage An (I Accuse), about a doctor who kills (“redeems”) his wife after she’s diagnosed with a debilitating disease.
“Why is it important to know this history?” asks the essay’s author, the memoirist Kenny Fries, before touching the third rail of historical comparisons: “We often say what happened in Nazi Germany couldn’t happen here. But some of it, like the mistreatment and sterilization of the disabled, did happen here.” Fries cites the 1927 Supreme Court ruling that authorized the compulsory sterilization of so-called “mental defectives” to, in the words of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, “prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.” (This decision has never been overturned.) Fries also calls out so-called “ugly laws,” which criminalized anyone appearing in public who was “diseased, maimed, mutilated or in any way deformed,” in the words of one Chicago ordinance that wasn’t repealed until 1974.
There is a long history of dehumanizing language facilitating dehumanizing behavior toward people with disabilities in the United States. But how we talk about disability is changing as people with disabilities assert their rights as the country’s largest minority group: 26 percent of Americans have a disability, according to the Centers for Disease Control. This number encompasses a wide range of conditions often invisible to coworkers and classmates, like severe depression and anxiety. More than one third of this group identify as swing voters, and more than 70 percent said it “really matters” who won the 2016 election, compared with just 59 percent of voters who did not report having a disability.
Plenty of politicians still ignore and disdain people with disabilities, though not always as openly as Donald Trump’s mockery of a New York Times reporter with a congenital joint condition in 2016—which voters said enraged them more than anything else Trump had said or done before then. The bar is slightly higher for Democrats; several candidates have introduced policies to help people with disabilities: Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced loan-relief legislation for students with severe disabilities. Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker co-sponsored the Disability Integration Act to force health care companies to offer long-term services to people with disabilities.
If some candidates are paying lip service, is it the right lip service? Three times in a recent Democratic debate, Warren resume-checked her years as “a special needs teacher.” Immediately after the debate, a disability advocate emailed one of my colleagues to criticize Warren for “inadvertently harming the disabled community” by using a term that “is not only outdated, but harmful.”
The term “special needs” took hold in the early 20th century as a switch from “handicapped,” itself a loaded term that originally referred to racehorses. (“Handicap” derives from “hand in cap,” describing people who reached a hand into a cap that held the bets at racetracks.) “Handicapped” had replaced “crippled,” first used in the 1300s, one in a long cycle of disparaging labels like “invalid,” “imbecile,” “impaired,” “spastic,” and “retarded.” There is a history of scorn and violence in these words, though some activists have reclaimed “crippled,” including at Cripple magazine and Crip the Vote, an online movement encouraging the political participation of people with disabilities.
But “special needs,” which didn’t start as a slur, is resoundingly rejected by campaigns like #DontCallMeSpecial. “Special” is the latest euphemism to become a dysphemism, the morphing of what’s meant to be a positive phrase into a derogatory one. “Special needs” fell out of fashion when advocates pointed out there’s nothing “special” about needing health care, education, safety, and access to public accommodations. The Americans With Disabilities Act National Network cautions against using “special” and other “condescending” terms like “handi-capable” and “differently abled.” The National Center on Disability and Journalism says “special” should be avoided because it “euphemistically stigmatizes that which is different.” It recommends the phrase “functional needs,” as in “the functional needs of people with disabilities.” It also advocates people-first language like “people with disabilities” instead of “the disabled” for the same reasons “you would avoid referring to ‘the Asians,’ ‘the Jews’ or ‘the African-Americans’”: “The” has definitional power. It essentializes, reduces, and distances.
Mother Jones’ style guide, which we’ve been updating and are preparing to publish, is informed by NCDJ’s approach. Our stance on writing about disabilities is flexible but calibrated: We defer to sources’ preferences on how they want to be described, but when their wishes aren’t known, we default to the term “people with disabilities.” “People with physical limitations” is also useful—not everyone with a limitation is disabled.
The frustrating truth about labels is that they constantly change, and not always as fast as rights and awareness. When vocabulary doesn’t catch up, people without a trace of malice can be left using yesterday’s words while judged by today’s definitions. If even Elizabeth Warren gets branded as someone “harming” people with disabilities by using words widely accepted not long ago and still in widespread use, it’s progress of a kind: You can measure meaningful strides in public life by the criticism rightly aimed at politicians’ word choice when it falls behind their policies.
People with disabilities do not share a single voice or set of words—which is why the 60-plus essays in About Us don’t share a vocabulary or set of labels, bouncing from “disabled people” to “the disabled” to “people with disabilities” to “special.” The essays enlarge more than they standardize; they broaden more than they box in. The stories “do a double trick: They normalize disability and they exceptionalize it,” Andrew Solomon writes in the forward. The reason “special” gets a pass in the book and not in Warren’s speech is because the book critically examines it; in Warren’s words, it’s rotely recited.
The disability rights movement is growing. But our country has not escaped its deep history of institutional contempt for people with disabilities. Law and language are starting to improve, and attitudes with them. If you’re a person with a disability, where are you on these issues? Is disability an integral part of your identity (being disabled) or a condition (having a disability), or both? What do you want candidates to do, not just say?

Havekost recalled walking out of the bathroom and seeing the gunman at the other end of the hallway. A co-worker turned to her and yelled, ‘GO!’ and she was able to run out of the building, unharmed. “She told us the story and we all were just in tears,” Cotter Smasal says.
Nearly four months later, Havekost tells the same story in a television campaign ad for Cotter Smasal, who is running for the state Senate seat in the district of the Virginia Beach shooting. Virginia holds its state elections in odd number years, and with just two weeks to go until Election Day the debate over strengthening gun control laws has emerged as the leading issue for voters. That’s especially true in the 8th district where Cotter Smasal, a former Navy officer, is locked in a close race with Bill DeSteph, the district’s incumbent Republican state senator who’s also a Navy veteran, as well as a gun collector and licensed firearms dealer with a cozy relationship with the National Rifle Association.
Many eyes are already glued to Virginia’s state elections, which are drawing unprecedented national attention as the state’s GOP fights to maintain its razor-thin majority control of both the House of Delegates and Senate. But after the May 31 shooting, this tight Virginia Beach race has become a bellwether not just for the state elections, but a look into how gun control could play out in the 2020 presidential race.

Cotter Smasal first became interested in local politics in 2017, when her daughter started at a public school and she learned that none of the local schools locked their entrance doors. “One morning I walked into the school and there’s no adults in sight, no one knows who’s in the building,” she recalls. After that, she complained to the school’s administrators and principal, who rebuffed her concerns and assured her that “everything is safe.” So she started a petition and quickly gathered 2,500 signatures asking the school board to start locking school doors and vetting visitors before they entered. It took a few months, but the petition was successful and schools across the city started requiring locked doors.
Cotter Smasal became interested in running for office after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in 2018. For more than 10 years, Cotter Smasal owned and operated a Rita’s Italian Ice in Virginia Beach and employed many teenagers. After Parkland, they would come to work and talk about the school shooting drills they had to regularly practice. One incident, she remembers, really inspired her to run for office: A girl came into work shaken, recounting how a fire alarm went off in school that day and her teacher told the class that they had to stay in the room until they were sure it was a real fire and not a shooter. “I was thinking, ‘I can’t believe this is the stuff that we’re doing, we’re letting this happen to these kids,’” Cotter Smasal recalls. “And I knew that we had a pretty extreme state senator on the issue who would not pick up the cause.” She says passing gun control laws such as universal background checks and red flag laws, are an “urgent, critical issue” for Virginia.
If history is any indication, DeSteph should be cruising into reelection. He was elected in 2015 with nearly 60 percent of the vote, and is the latest in a long line of Republicans who have represented Virginia Beach in the Senate. According to the Virginia Public Access Project—a nonprofit, nonpartisan Virginia politics and data organization—his district swings Republican by about 30 percent. But after the Virginia Beach shooting, the push to strengthen gun control laws in the state drew bipartisan support among voters, according to public polling.
“They want action,” says Cotter Smasal. “I’m hearing it across the board from people who identify as Republicans and Democrats.” At the end of her campaign ad, which has caused a bit of a stir in the district, Havekost says that after the May 31 shooting she “asked Bill DeSteph to do something so this doesn’t happen again,” and then explains how he, along with other GOP members of the state’s legislature, maneuvered to end a special session convened to pass gun control laws without passing any legislation. In response to the shooting, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called for a special session of the state’s General Assembly specifically to consider and pass a package of gun control bills, including universal background checks and red flag laws—two bills Cotter Smasal supports. But the session ended after just 90 minutes, when the GOP majority voted to adjourn without passing any bills. Days before, DeSteph attended a closed door town hall meeting hosted by the NRA in Virginia Beach to discuss the upcoming special session.

DeSteph did not take Cotter Smasal’s ad lightly, and quickly fired back with his own ad calling hers “shameful” and accusing her of using the Virginia Beach tragedy “for her political gain” and claiming that he “filed 27 pieces of legislation” after the shooting. None of those bills sought to change the state’s gun laws but instead called for treating gun violence as a mental health issue by calling for a study, as well as raising the penalties for violating the state’s existing gun laws.
She says his ad is nothing but an “attack” on a survivor of the Virginia Beach shooting. “I think that his attack just demonstrates what we always see from the gun lobby, they try to bully people into being silent, and silence only perpetuates more gun violence and more mass shootings,” she says.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The witnesses—Matt Masterson of the Department of Homeland Security, Nikki Floris of the FBI, Adam Hickey of the Department of Justice, and Ben Hovland of the Election Assistance Commission—represent some of the most active and knowledgeable experts on the subject heading into the 2020 election.
The hearing came the day after Facebook announced the takedown of four ongoing election disinformation campaigns (three from Iran, one from Russia), and featured testimony from Hovland warning that local officials are outmatched by foreign hackers and that his agency’s budget of $7.95 million—”less than the amount Kansas City spends on potholes”—limits how much they can help.
But even against this backdrop of serious concerns, some Republicans on the committee used their time with the experts to attempt to defend President Donald Trump against revelations linked to the Russian influence campaign that aided his election, and to push a thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory that the hack that targeted the Democratic National Committee either never happened, or was carried out by someone other than Russia.
Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, began by claiming that he’d “love to spend this time talking about election security,” before insisting that the hearing, a follow up panel titled “Securing America’s Elections Part II,” wasn’t about that topic. He soon began railing against impeachment, before Rep. Debbie Lesko, another Arizona Republican, picked up by asking a distracting and misleading question about the Democrats’ computer equipment.
“Looking back at the FBI’s activities investigating the 2016 election, it has been reported that FBI never obtained the original servers from the Democratic National Committee that had allegedly been hacked by Russia, instead relying on imaged copies,” Lesko said. Hickey responded in line with past statements from other government officials who have implied the question is irrelevant, saying the Department of Justice “got the information that we required for our investigation,” while more broadly defending the FBI’s investigation and conclusion the hacks were carried out by Russia, reached with the cooperation of Crowdstrike, a DNC security contractor.
Lesko then asked if Crowdstrike still had “possession of the Clinton servers,” parroting a branch of the president’s conspiracy theory that posits the firm is somehow hiding evidence of who really hacked the DNC and why. “I don’t know what they have possession of now,” Hickey said.
Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and one of the president’s most enthusiastic Congressional defenders, used his time to say Tuesday’s hearing was “about smearing the president of the United States and validating the corrupt people who have been involved in de-legitimizing his historic election.” He then badgered Floris into commenting on former FBI agent Peter Strzok’s affair. Texas Republican Louie Gohmert also focused his questioning on Strzok and purported efforts by Ukrainian officials to influence the 2016 election. He asked whether an FBI-led task force investigating foreign influence operations might “run informants against political campaigns,” a nod to unsubstantiated claims from Trump defenders that President Obama had illegally ordered federal agents to spy on the Trump campaign.
The conspiracy theories’ persistence shows how the president can lob disinformation bombs into the national discourse and expect to find Congressional Republicans willing to validate them, even in the face of all evidence. In the case of Crowdstrike, even Trump’s own advisers “repeatedly warned” the president that the theory was false, according to Tom Bossert, the president’s former homeland security adviser, who told ABC in late September that the theory “is completely debunked” and had “no validity.” He also told the New York Times that he was “deeply disturbed” that the president not only persisted in believing the theory but pressed the Ukrainian government to use it to attack a political rival.
Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University and an an expert on computer security and disinformation who has written extensively on the 2016 Russian hack-and-leak operation and testified before Congress on the matter, has been very critical of the president’s embrace of the Crowdstrike theory. When asked about it coming up during Tuesday’s election security hearing, he was equally disdainful.
“It’s hard to come up with an on-the-record response [to be honest] that doesn’t contain something something expletive-stupid,” Rid told Mother Jones Tuesday. “The server-is-in-Ukraine theory is up there with chemtrails.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) released evidence on Tuesday that the Justice Department buried the whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president by failing to refer the matter to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Klobuchar suggested the Justice Department violated a longstanding agreement between the agencies to share information about possible campaign finance violations for potential enforcement action.
To recap: The whistleblower complaint at the heart of the impeachment inquiry didn’t just contain evidence that the president pressured a foreign government to help him win reelection. It also contained evidence of a potential campaign finance violation. When President Trump asked for dirt on his political opponent, he likely illegally solicited a “thing of value” from a foreign national.
In August, Justice Department officials decided that rather than turn the whistleblower complaint over to Congress, department lawyers would assess the allegations against Trump, including evidence that the president had broken campaign finance law. After what news reports described as a cursory review, the department declined to launch a criminal investigation, finding that Trump had not asked for a “thing of value.” This was a stretch; campaign finance experts generally agree that opposition research damaging to an opponent, which campaigns can pay a lot of money for, is clearly valuable. The FEC also considers it a “thing of value.” Nevertheless, the department lawyers declared the matter case closed.
But under a 1978 memorandum of understanding between the department and the FEC—which, like Justice is authorized to penalize campaign finance violations—the complaint should have been passed onto the FEC even if the department declined to launch a criminal investigation, so the election watchdog can determine whether a civil penalty is called for.
Earlier this month, Klobuchar set out to uncover whether the Justice Department had honored this agreement, sending two letters to the FEC inquiring whether it had received any such referral. On October 18, the commission’s Democratic chair, Ellen Weintraub, confirmed to Klobuchar that the FEC had not been notified. “The refusal to inform the FEC and refer the matter regarding the President’s call to the FEC as required to do, as the Justice Department is required, undermines our campaign finance system and is unacceptable in a democracy,” Klobuchar said in Tuesday statement.
What’s unclear so far is why no such referral was made. Either the Justice Department dropped the ball, or Klobuchar has helped discover another avenue in the administration’s sprawling coverup.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The first historical marker was removed and thrown in the river by vandals. The second and third signs were riddled with bullet holes.
On Saturday, a fourth roadside memorial to Emmett Till was dedicated in Mississippi, honoring the 14-year-old whose torture and murder at the hands of white supremacists in 1955 helped galvanize the civil rights movement. This time, the marker—made of steel—weighs 500 pounds and is covered with bulletproof glass.
A historical preservation group persisted in restoring the marker to ensure that the horrific attack and the significance of the site are publicly recognized, said Patrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission. There will be a fifth or sixth monument if necessary, Weems said.
“We just have to be resilient and know there are folks out there that don’t want to know this history or who want to erase this history,” Weems told the Associated Press. “We are just going to be resilient in continuing to put them back up and be truthful in making sure that Emmett didn’t die in vain.”
Among those attending the dedication were two cousins of Till’s, including one who was with him the night he was kidnapped from his grandfather’s home by a group of white men.
“What they did to Emmett was so ugly that even the Tallahatchie River spewed his body back out so he could be seen and found,” one cousin, Airickca Gordon-Taylor, told the New York Times. “Basically my family is still being confronted with a hate crime against Emmett Till and it’s almost 65 years later.”

Over the better part of a decade, Imaad Zuberi solicited money from foreign people and firms to donate to US political campaigns and he promised to influence American politicians on those foreigners’ behalf, both of which are illegal. But he didn’t actually spend all the money on lobbying: It turns out he personally pocketed much of the money—also illegal—according to an announcement from federal prosecutors in Los Angeles on Tuesday. While the criminal charges relate to activity that Zuberi engaged prior to Trump’s election, prosecutors describe Zuberi’s inaugural donation as part of years long effort to gain “access to high-level US officials.”
Zuberi, who operates a Los Angeles-based venture capital firm called Avenue Ventures, has agreed to plead guilty to tax evasion, to filing phony foreign agent registration materials, and to “making almost $1 million in illegal campaign contributions that included funneling money from foreign entities and individuals to influence U.S. elections,” according to prosecutors. They also say he promised foreign nationals and governments that “he could use his influence in Washington, D.C. to change United States foreign policy and create business opportunities for his clients and himself.”
According to the document outlining charges against Zuberi, in 2014 he convinced Sri Lanka to pay him an astounding $8.5 million to help the country improve its image in the United States. Zuberi appears to have pocketed all but $850,000 of that fee. He eventually registered with the Justice Department as a lobbyist for Sri Lanka, but prosecutors say the paperwork was riddled with false statements.
The prosecutors’ filing describes an array of unnamed foreign individuals and clients from whom Zuberi solicited consulting and other fees, and it lists dozens of contributions he made to US politicians from 2012 to 2016 using foreign funds. The campaigns are not identified, but Zuberi gave largely to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.
After Clinton’s loss, Zuberi switched to backing the GOP, including his large donation to Trump’s inaugural. This contribution appears to have drawn notice from the US Attorney’s office in Manhattan, which subpoenaed Trump’s inaugural committee early this year for any documents and communications it had with Zuberi. At the time of his inaugural donation, Zuberi was working to help officials from Qatar develop ties the new Trump administration. We reported on this and Zuberi’s connections to Trumpworld back in February:
Zuberi told Mother Jones that he had in fact hoped to broker and earn commissions on deals in which Qatar’s deep-pocketed sovereign wealth fund invested in US projects. At the time, Zuberi denied wrongdoing and claimed he had no clue why federal prosecutors were interested in him. It’s not clear where the Manhattan investigation stands or how the subpoena mentioning Zuberi might relate to California case.

The legal concept being promulgated here is that executive privilege behaves according to something like the transitive property—that the president’s privilege extends to Giuliani and thus extends to the goons to whom Giuliani had subcontracted the actual ratfucking work. That’s a wild stretch, but the more significant thing about the argument is that it explicitly ties the case to Trump.
Parnas and his associate Igor Fruman have pleaded not guilty to federal campaign finance charges. As my colleague Dan Friedman has reported, Giuliani, who has represented Parnas and Fruman, has said that his clients “have helped him seek political dirt in Ukraine on former Vice President Joe Biden and other matters,” an effort at the core of House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.

“You can’t have a quid pro quo with no quo,” Ratcliffe had insisted, a sound-bite friendly way of claiming that such a scenario was legally impossible because, according to Trump and his allies, Ukrainian officials had been unaware that Trump had suspended military aid to that country.
But just hours after Trump’s tweet, the New York Times published a report dismantling that very claim:

At a campaign event in 2016, Trump said, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters.” On Wednesday morning, William Consovoy, an attorney for Trump, made the case that such an action could not be criminally investigated while Trump was in office at a hearing in the ongoing court battle over the president’s tax returns.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. subpoenaed eight years of Trump’s tax returns for his investigation of whether Trump broke any New York State laws when he reimbursed his now-imprisoned personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for hush fund payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump refused to release his taxes and sued the DA under the argument that a sitting president can’t be prosecuted. His lawyers are now appealing a federal judge’s ruling that called their argument “repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values.”

In the face of new and damning evidence in the Trump-Ukraine scandal, he is making false claims and trying to mount diversions. On Wednesday morning, Trump responded to William Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, who the day before presented testimony to Congress confirming the White House withheld security assistance from Ukraine in an effort to pressure its president to launch investigations to produce political dirt useful for Trump and his reelection campaign. Quoting a GOP member of Congress, Trump tweeted that no such thing happened. “Neither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can’t have a quid pro quo with no quo.’ Congressman John Ratcliffe @foxandfriends.” And referring to the still-unidentified CIA official who had filed the complaint about Trump’s actions regarding Ukraine that triggered this scandal, he added, “Where is the Whistleblower? The Do Nothing Dems case is DEAD!”

Once more, Trump was trying to gaslight the nation.
Taylor had indeed testified during his closed-door session with congressional investigators that Ukrainian officials were aware Trump was withholding nearly $400 million in military assistance at the same time he and his minions were pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election (which held that Russia did not hack the election) and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump was also insisting that Zelensky announce publicly that these investigations were underway. Taylor was quite explicit about all this in his lengthy and detailed opening statement, which was leaked. In fact, the news that Trump was holding up the funds for Ukraine was reported publicly on August 29. Days later, Taylor testified, the top White House aide on Ukrainian matters, Tim Morrison, told him that Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union and a key figure in this caper, had told Andriy Yermak, a senior Zelensky aide, that the security assistance money would not be sent to Ukraine until Zelensky committed to pursing the Biden investigation.
So there it is: a much-respected veteran diplomat who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations testifying that Sondland, doing Trump’s bidding, had threatened the Ukraine government: No investigation, no money. That’s extortion.
But Taylor had so much more to say. And his testimony shows there was more than one quid pro quo.
Throughout this spring and summer, Trump was using whatever leverage he had on Zelensky to force him to mount these political investigations. During this stretch, Zelensky and his aides desperately wanted a White House meeting with Trump—which would signal that despite Trump’s fondness for Vladimir Putin, the United States remained a strong partner of Ukraine, as it battled the Russian and Moscow-backed forces that had invaded eastern swaths of Ukraine. Yet Trump issued a condition: No investigation, no meeting. Taylor testified that he was informed that during a July 10 meeting between Ukrainian officials and top White House officials, Sondland told the Ukrainians that an Oval Office face to face between Zelensky and Trump was contingent on the “investigations.” (At that point in the meeting, John Bolton, then the national security adviser, abruptly ended the conversation, and top NSC official Fiona Hill told Taylor, according to his testimony, that Bolton later referred to this proposed arrangement as a “drug deal.”)
And Taylor had more to reveal about this. In September, Taylor testified, Sondland informed him that he, Sondland, had committed a mistake when he earlier had told the Ukrainians that a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky was dependent on Zelensky publicly announcing these show investigations; instead, “everything,” including the withheld security assistance, was conditioned on such an announcement. Here was Sondland acknowledging there had been not one but two quid pro quos: the military money and a White House meeting, if Zelensky submitted to Trump’s demand.
Then there was the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky. According to a reconstructed transcript released by the White House, when the Ukrainian president raised the subject of obtaining from the Trump administration more Javelin anti-tank missiles—which the Ukrainians could use against the Russian invaders in the east—Trump immediately responded with the now-infamous line: “I would like you to do us a favor though.” He then pushed Zelensky to investigate both that nutty theory about the 2016 election and “the other thing”—the Bidens. Trump and his GOP defenders have repeatedly said there was no quid pro quo in this call. That’s bunk. You want missiles? Then give me information I can use to clear the Russians and harm a political foe.
Add it up, and you have three quid pro quos. Or one huge quid pro quo with three distinct parts. The Ukrainians were looking for the security assistance that Congress had already authorized and the Pentagon had cleared for release. They desired a get-together in the Oval Office between Trump and Zelensky. And they wanted more Javelin missiles. In response to each of these requests, Trump said, first give me political dirt. And a crucial part of the deal would be Zelensky publicly proclaiming that the Bidens were under investigation, which in and of itself would taint Biden and create a controversy for him.
Taylor’s testimony is a strong indictment of Trump and the henchmen, including Rudy Giuliani, he used to muscle Zelensky. It details not an impetuous act but a monthslong campaign on Trump’s part to squeeze Zelensky, and Trump exploited US government policy and funds for this moblike extortion racket.
As for Trump’s reference to the whistleblower, that’s just Trump trying to change the subject. Though this anonymous CIA official who was detailed to the National Security Council kicked things off by submitting a complaint to the inspector general of the intelligence community, Taylor’s testimony, and the accounts of others who have appeared before the House Intelligence Committee, practically renders him irrelevant. Taylor’s opening statement matches the complaint and provides investigators an easy-to-read roadmap of where to go next: who to interview, what documents to seek. The whistleblower, in a way, is not needed at this point.
Trump and his gang will continue to ask questions about the whistleblower—with some pushing the notion that he is a part of the deep state plot to sabotage Trump—and raise other questions about how the investigation is being handled. (On Wednesday morning, a band of Republican House members stormed into a committee room used for classified and sensitive hearings in order to disrupt the deposition of a Pentagon official involved in Ukraine policy. They claim they were protesting the Democrats holding private interviews with witnesses, but there is nothing unusual about investigators conducting depositions in private—which was routinely done by the House Intelligence Committee when it was controlled by Republicans during its Russia investigation—and GOP members and staffers of the relevant committees are allowed to attend these sessions.) When the evidence is damning—and shows you’re a liar—assail the process. Or, in Trump’s case, declare black is white. In the Ukraine scandal, he is drowning in a sea of improper—and perhaps illegal—quid pro quos. Obviously, he and his cultists will stick with the playbook he used during the Trump-Russia scandal: Attack witnesses and investigators, distract with real or imagined side-issues, and deny reality. For the moment, though, reality may be catching up to Trump—and the investigation is not yet finished.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Matt Gaetz crashed a House impeachment hearing Wednesday, it was hard not to think of a specific historical parallel: The image of several dozen middle-aged white men in suits shutting down a closed-door meeting brought to mind the infamous “Brooks Brothers Riot” of 2000, when a mob of Republican aides—including Trump confidante Roger Stone—stormed a Miami-Dade County canvassing board meeting to physically halt the presidential recount.
But you don’t even have to go back that far to put what happened Wednesday into context. The Gaetz crusade feels familiar because it’s the kind of brazen stunt that Republican state legislators pull off all the time—blowing up the traditions of good governance and betting that the benefits they reap will be worth the backlash. They’re usually correct.
Last month in North Carolina, Republicans managed to override a Democratic governor’s budget veto by lying to Democratic legislators about the day’s vote schedule. In June, Republican senators in Oregon fled to Idaho in order to kill a proposed cap-and-trade bill—days after threats from a sympathetic militia group shut down the state capitol. West Virginia Republicans impeached the entire state supreme court in 2018, just because they could. Arizona Republicans packed their own state supreme court this year, just because they could. When a Democrat was elected governor of North Carolina in 2016, Republicans pushed through legislation in the lame-duck session to strip him of his powers. Wisconsin Republicans did the same thing two years later.
State legislatures are laboratories of democracy where highly trained scientists (OK, a surprisingly high number of them are car salesmen) devise increasingly brazen ways to wield power. The House Republican caucus is filled with former Republican state legislators—like Gaetz—and one lesson Republican state legislators have learned time and again over the last decade is that rules and norms are only as sturdy as the willingness and capacity to enforce them. By noshing on pizza in a secure meeting room while a witness waited to give testimony, Gaetz et al. were operating with the blessing of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)—and sending a clear sign about how the impeachment battle is going to be fought. It’s a play we’ve seen before.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

During a call announcing elections-related policy changes, Facebook said the operations, three of which originated in Iran and the other from Russia and targeted the US, North Africa, and Latin America, were examples of “coordinated inauthentic behavior” campaigns designed to make content artificially popular while concealing who is behind a message.
“Actors in these nations are continuing to attempt to interfere in elections and public debate around the world, and including in the US,” Zuckerberg said on a Monday call with reporters, boasting that the company was “more prepared heading into 2020,” and that its detection of the networks “should provide some confidence that our systems here are working.”
The company has taken down more than 50 such networks over the last year. Monday’s announcement, which followed a speech Zuckerberg gave on Thursday defending his company’s record on free expression, is proof that tools designed to identify such behavior earlier are working, said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy.
“It is fairly early in their operational cycle,” he said, offering an assessment of the network operators’ progress. “They’re still trying to build their audience, and they put a bunch of effort into concealing who they were and hiding and having very good operational security. But we were able to find them and stop them before they were able to complete their operation—really as they were just getting going.”
The company also used the call to announce several new and updated policies around elections, including a ban on voter suppression ads encouraging people not to cast ballots. A number of steps are aimed at increasing information about who is spreading messages on the platform, include showing the confirmed owner of a page, labeling state-controlled media on their pages and in the company’s Ad Library, instituting a US presidential candidate spending tracker, making fact-checking labels clearer, and promising an “initial investment of $2 million” for media literacy projects “to help people better understand the information they see online.”  The company also outlined plans to offer more secure accounts to candidates, elected officials, and their teams, along with heightened monitoring for potential hacks.
One policy unaffected by Monday’s announcement is one rolled out in late September exempting politicians from third-party fact-checking on the grounds that what politicians say is inherently newsworthy and should be “seen and heard,” even if untruthful. On Thursday, before a crowd at Georgetown University and in the face of wide criticism related to the policy, Zuckerberg defended his company as a force for good in the world, a platform where everyday people express ideas. He told the crowd that though he’d considered banning political advertising in the past, the impulse to “pull back from free expression” throughout history has always been wrong, even in times of considerable social strife. One example he cited, the repression of Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil right struggle, drew a rebuke from King’s daughter, Bernice, suggesting that the very kinds of disinformation the company’s policy allows politicians to engage in helped get her father killed.

In response to her comments, Zuckerberg said Monday that the King’s assassination is “clearly a major national tragedy and I think she’s right that these issues around hate and disinformation likely played a role in the environment” around his murder. But he doubled down on the premise of last week’s remarks, saying that King “never lost faith in the importance of free expression” before his death.
“If you only ever focus on the downside or the risk of certain things, then you are naturally, over time, going to restrict things maybe more than would be ideal and best,” he said.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","Just hours before a high-profile federal opioid trial was to begin in Cleveland on Monday morning, drug companies reached a $260 million settlement deal with Ohio’s Summit and Cuyahoga counties. The two counties are bellwether plaintiffs—test cases for how the more than 2,700 counties, cities, and tribal lands suing drug companies in the same federal lawsuit would fare. Monday’s news suggests that a multi-billion dollar settlement deal resolving the thousands of cases is on the horizon.
Summit and Cuyahoga—and, indeed, all of the plaintiffs in the federal case—are grappling with competing demands. On the one hand, cash-strapped municipalities want to avoid years of protracted litigation and secure money to cover addiction treatment, emergency services, and other costs associated with responding to the epidemic. Cuyahoga and Summit Counties have been particularly devastated by the opioid crisis: Akron, in Summit County, rented refrigerated trailers to handle the influx of bodies; the Cuyahoga County medical examiner told me in 2017 that the overdoses amounted to a “tidal wave.”
On the other hand, settling might not garner nearly as much the plaintiffs would like: $260 million is far less than the more than $7 billion the two Ohio counties originally sought to cover addiction treatment, emergency services, and other costs associated with the epidemic. Crucially, settling enables drug companies to avoid airing dirty laundry during a highly anticipated trial. The details of the settlement have not yet been made public, but often, settlement terms require sealing, deleting, or shredding thousands of pages of damning evidence.
“I wouldn’t hold it against these counties or states that settle these cases because they desperately need the money to tackle this problem,” said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, who studies opioid policy at Brandeis University and who was a paid expert witness in Oklahoma’s recent trial against Johnson & Johnson. “The problem with settling is that the public doesn’t get to really see or learn about all of the wrongdoing. What’s become public is only the tip of the iceberg.”
Under the terms of the settlement in Ohio, the three companies responsible for distributing the majority of America’s drugs from pharmaceutical makers to pharmacies—McKesson, Amerisource Bergen, and Cardinal Health—will pay a combined $215 million immediately to Summit and Cuyahoga Counties to settle charges that they failed to report suspicious orders of drugs. Teva, an Israeli generics drugmakers, will pay $20 million and contribute $25 million in opioid addiction treatment Suboxone. (Walgreens, a defendant in the same case, didn’t settle; its case has been postponed.) Several other drug companies—including Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, and Endo—settled with the two counties earlier this fall.
For now, the drug companies that have settled still have to contend with the 2,700 other plaintiffs in the federal case (with the exception of Purdue Pharma and fentanyl maker Insys, which have declared bankruptcy). But Monday’s news suggests a willingness on behalf of the companies to pay now rather than face trials that would likely reveal internal emails, sales calls, distribution reports, and marketing strategies. “If I were those companies, I wouldn’t want [the exhibits] to see the light of day either,” said Jonathan Novak, a former Drug Enforcement Agency attorney who now represents plaintiffs in other opioid lawsuits. “The language that’s all over these documents—the emails, et cetera—it’s not a good look, and it’s not a humanitarian look.”
The exhibits that were already made public in the trial included, for example, a damning 2001 email from Purdue’s former president, Richard Sackler, about meeting with patient advocacy groups: “Our goal is to bind these organizations more closely to us than heretofore, but also to align them with our expanded mission and to see that the fate of our product(s) are inextricably bound up with the trajectory of the pain movement,” he wrote. Exhibits that came to light earlier this year in a separate opioid trial, Oklahoma’s case against J&J—the first such case to go to trial to date—showed how the company became the country’s leading supplier of opiate raw ingredients, growing mutant poppies in Tasmania and selling narcotics to Purdue, among other drug manufacturers.
Still, sealing evidence in drug cases is common practice. A recent Reuters investigation found that judges frequently sealed evidence related to public health and safety in cases involving drugs and other defective products without giving “their reasons for allowing secrecy, though they are required to do so.” One prime example: Back in 2001, West Virginia accused Purdue Pharma of misleading doctors about the addictive risks associated with its blockbuster opioid OxyContin. The discovery phase included thousands of internal memos, sales calls, and marketing plans. The evidence was never made public.
If evidence gathered over several years of discovery in the federal case is sealed, Kolodny worries that valuable information about the way the epidemic came to be—including the way that drug companies influenced politicians, medical journals, continuing medical education, and organizations that create standards for physicians and hospitals—will be lost. “If everything gets sealed and shredded as part of the settlement,” he said, “we never get to learn these lessons and act on them.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

What’s even crazier is that SoftBank must have known this all along. It’s one thing for the outside world to be fooled, but Softbank was a major investor. They must have seen the books. They must have known about Neumann’s sketchy insidery deals. They must have known there was nothing really special about yet another office leasing company, even if it did “activate the space” and appeal to millennials. Space is space.
So how is it that within the span of ten months, SoftBank reduced its valuation of WeWork from $48 billion to $8 billion? Was their January valuation all just part of the scam?
And here’s another little nugget to chew on: even now, on a revenue basis, WeWork is valued at more than 5x the level of IWG, its stodgy old competitor that does pretty much the exact same thing they do. Even after all the revelations of the past few weeks, WeWork still looks plenty overvalued.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The governing Liberal Party had largely positive results in Monday night’s federal election when it came to key politicians on environmental files, with the exception of Amarjeet Sohi, who had been the natural resources minister.
“With at least 63 percent of voters casting ballots for parties that put forward strong climate platforms, it is clear that a majority of Canadians asked for more ambitious and urgent climate action,” said Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada.
“People voted out of fear of the Conservatives today, rejecting their threats to roll back climate policy. At the same time, voters did not have enough confidence in the Liberal climate record to hand them another majority.”
Environment Minister Is Reelected
Catherine McKenna, the Trudeau government’s one and only environment and climate change minister, was re-elected in her riding of Ottawa Centre on Monday.
As of 11:50 p.m. ET, McKenna was leading the NDP’s Emilie Taman by over 8,000 votes, or 47 percent. The Conservative Party candidate, Carol Clemenhagen was in a distant third.
Over the last four years McKenna was tasked with stickhandling a difficult balancing act—promoting the Trudeau government’s carbon pollution pricing regime while backing the government’s purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline and expansion project.
She became the face of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s environmental battle early on, a position that would give her an enormous public profile.
Months after the Trudeau government signed a climate plan with the provinces, McKenna was contending with legal threats from Saskatchewan in early 2017 as she asserted the federal “right” to price pollution. (So far, courts have upheld that right; Ontario’s case is being appealed to the Supreme Court.)
As right-leaning politicians tilted against environmental policies across the country, winning provincial elections in Alberta, Ontario and elsewhere, they often invoked McKenna’s name personally. Online trolls targeted her; the abuse drifted into the real world and led to the minister requiring protection.
In a bid to perhaps differentiate her candidacy from the rest of the Trudeau team, McKenna put up unusual election signs in colors like bright pink, black and white that sported phrases such as “vote for gun control” and “vote for public service jobs.” Former Liberal prime minister Jean Chretien also campaigned with McKenna.
Taman, a former public prosecutor, battled McKenna for control of the young, densely populated riding. Taman had been the NDP’s hope to bring Ottawa Centre back to the party, after McKenna scored an upset victory in 2015.
The riding is filled with many young professionals who work in the city’s downtown, as well as young families who want to live in the core of the city. It was considered a toss-up through the last hours of the campaign.
Taman became well known in Ottawa after being denied permission to run by the public service in 2015, but ran anyway in Ottawa-Vanier, bringing the public service commission to court to overturn its decision.
This year, Taman ran on a campaign emphasizing inequality, the climate crisis and confronting intolerance.
Green Party Scores an Upset Victory
Green Party candidate Jenica Atwin scored an upset victory in the New Brunswick riding of Fredericton on Monday.
Atwin, who ​has worked in First Nations education, had the wind at her sails, boosted by Green success in the region. New Brunswick Green Leader David Coon, for example, has held the provincial riding of Fredericton South since 2014.
The Greens also made a breakthrough provincially in P.E.I., capturing over 30 percent of the vote and securing eight seats. Greens also elected their first Ontario MPP, and in spring, a second federal Green Party MP was elected.
Atwin was able to beat Liberal incumbent Matt DeCourcey as well as fight off Conservative candidate Andrea Johnson. CBC News said Atwin had won at 11:45 p.m. ET with 14,318 votes or 33.3 percent.
Atwin ran as a provincial Green in 2018 and campaigned on healthcare with a focus on mental health.
She has worked with Oromocto First Nation and then Kingsclear First Nation at Fredericton HIgh School, the Brunswickan reported. She has also carried out educational research on behalf of Indigenous communities in New Brunswick, according to the newspaper.
When Stephen Guilbeault described his decision to leave the environmental activist world and run for the Liberals recently to the National Post, he summed it up as “been there, done that, got the T-shirt.”
On Monday, it was clear this position paid off for Guilbeault, as he coasted to victory in his riding of Laurier–Sainte-Marie.
CBC News said Guilbeault had won the riding at 11:49 p.m. ET with 6,555 votes or 42 percent.
The populous, small riding was held by the NDP’s Hélène Laverdière, who announced she would not run in 2019. Laverdière took the riding away from former Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe.
It is the third-most dense riding in Canada, and younger and poorer compared to the average across the country. Guilbeault fought off a challenge from the NDP’s Nimâ Machouf.
Guilbeault stunned the environmental activism community when he decided to run for the Trudeau camp. Guilbeault, who has protested pipelines, formerly worked as an activist for Greenpeace before co-founding Quebec environmental organization Equiterre.
He benefited from massive name recognition, but also found himself campaigning for a government that bought the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project. He explained his position as a desire to support the Liberal environmental package as a whole.
“If you only look at a tree, you lose sight of the forest,” he told CTV News. “I understand why some people are so angry about the pipeline…you have every right to be angry but look at the whole picture.”
National Resources Minister Loses Seat
Tim Uppal, the former Harper government junior minister, won his rematch against Amarjeet Sohi, who became the Trudeau government’s infrastructure minister and then its natural resources minister, in Edmonton Mill Woods.
Sohi, the former three-term Edmonton city councillor was in a tough fight against Uppal, who Sohi beat in 2015 by just 92 votes, in a race that went to judicial recount.
CBC News said Uppal was elected with over 50 percent of the vote, or 17,588 votes.
Sohi was one of only three Liberals in Alberta, along with fellow Edmontonian Randy Boissonnault and Calgarian Kent Hehr. The Liberals have been polling far back in second place in the prairies.
In his first ministerial job, Sohi showcased billions of dollars in funding for major infrastructure initiatives, some of which involved mega-projects like light rail developments that the Liberals were hoping would cut carbon pollution.
But after he was shuffled into the natural resources profile, he found himself defending many policies that had become political roadkill in his home province of Alberta.
Uppal remained involved in politics, playing a “key role” in the campaign of Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, his former Harper government cabinet colleague, CBC reported.
Uppal also campaigned using similar messaging as Kenney’s provincial campaign: attacking the Trudeau government’s C-69, the government’s overhaul of its environmental assessment regime, and C-48, which imposes an oil tanker moratorium along British Columbia’s north coast, as well as the carbon tax.
Liberal at TMX Terminus Leading in Riding
The Trans Mountain oil pipeline snakes through Alberta and British Columbia to end up at the Burnaby Terminal in the Vancouver area.
Throughout the election it has cast a political shadow over the riding—but Terry Beech, the Liberal incumbent, was leading in his riding of Burnaby North-Seymour late into election night.
Beech, who won the riding with 36 percent in 2015, battled it out this election campaign with Svend Robinson, a 25-year former MP, as well as Heather Leung, who was a Tory candidate but was dropped due to comments deemed offensive.
Beech was leading Robinson by 1,021 votes as of 12:15 a.m. ET.
He voted against the pipeline project, and has maintained that his constituents don’t support it.
Robinson, who suffers from bipolar disorder, was planning a political comeback. His career was disrupted after he stole an engagement ring from an auction and pleaded guilty to theft over $5,000 in 2004.
Burnaby North-Seymour is smaller and less dense than average. It is richer than the average across the country, and well-educated, with more than half holding postsecondary degrees.
Fisheries Minister Keeps His Seat
Jonathan Wilkinson, the Trudeau government’s fisheries minister and the former Parliamentary secretary for the environment to Catherine McKenna, hung on to his riding of North Vancouver.
As of 12:04 a.m. ET, Wilkinson was leading his Conservative rival Andrew Saxton by 2,200 votes.
In 2015, Wilkinson, a former constitutional negotiator, beat out former Harper government Parliamentary secretary for finance Andrew Saxton, who had held the seat between 2008 and 2015. The riding had been reliably conservative until 2004.
Like Sohi in Edmonton, Wilkinson faced a rematch in his riding with Saxton. The Liberal minister, who helped promote the government’s multi-billion dollar Oceans Protection Plan, accused his People’s Party opponent of spreading misinformation this campaign.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In closed-door testimony to House impeachment investigators, William B. Taylor alleged that he had been told by Gordon Sondland—the GOP megadonor and hotel magnate who Trump appointed as ambassador to the European Union—that both military assistance for the war-torn country and a White House visit for its new president would be contingent on an announcement that Ukrainian officials would investigate Democrats. The Post, which obtained Taylor’s opening statement, reported:
Trump has insisted that there was no connection between the suspension of military aid to Ukraine and his attempts to pressure Zelensky into investigating Democrats, often repeating the phrase “no quid pro quo.” But Trump’s chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, publicly contradicted this line last week, when he appeared to admit that Trump had indeed linked military aid to an investigation related to the 2016 actions of the Democratic National Committee, which Wasserman Schultz ran at the time.

The Judge Had to Teach Him What “Arson” and “Alleged” Mean.,Samantha Michaels,MotherJones,Crime and Justice,"On Monday, a nine-year-old boy in a checkered shirt sat in a juvenile court in Woodford County, Illinois, accused of murdering several of his relatives by setting fire to a mobile home. As he slid forward in his chair, his feet barely reached the ground.
The Chicago Tribune captured the scene at the arraignment hearing, where Judge Charles Feeney tried to explain the charges to the confused elementary schooler:
The boy, whom Mother Jones will not name because of his age, is accused of intentionally setting the April blaze that killed four of his relatives and his mom’s boyfriend near Goodfield, Illinois. The case has garnered national attention, and prompted outcry from juvenile justice advocates who say a nine-year-old is far too young to be prosecuted in court.
If convicted, he would not be sent to juvenile hall because of his youth. But the court could put him on years of probation, according to the Tribune. And if he were to violate any of the complicated terms of probation, he could be detained after he turns 10, and sent to prison once he turns 13.
“It’s very unusual,” Elizabeth Clarke, president of the Juvenile Justice Initiative in Illinois, told the Washington Post of the case. “It’s a shocking approach that the prosecutor chose to take.”
Katie Alwood, the boy’s mother, told CBS News that her son was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, ADHD, and bipolar disorder.
While it is rare for a child so young to face such serious charges, Illinois is not the only state that allows nine-year-olds to be put in this situation. Far from it. Twenty-nine states have no lower age limit for prosecuting children in juvenile court, which means it’s perfectly legal to bring charges against children of any age, according to the National Juvenile Defender Center. That’s even as the Supreme Court has recognized that children are less culpable than adults because their brains aren’t developed yet. And it’s despite research showing that early involvement in the criminal justice system can be bad for kids’ health and make them more likely to commit crimes later.
The National Juvenile Defender Center put together a map showing the situation in each state:
The boy will continue to fight his case; the judge set another hearing for November. Alwood told CBS News that her son deserved a second chance: “Yes, it was a horrible tragedy, but it’s still not something to throw his life away over.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Anti-Corruption Activists Are Worried.,Dan Friedman,MotherJones,Politics,"The Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank known as a bastion of the bipartisan US foreign policy establishment, is under fire from its own members and dozens of international affairs experts over its acceptance of a $12 million gift to fund an internship program from Leonard Blavatnik, a Ukrainian-born billionaire with longstanding ties to oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The dispute makes the think tank the latest institution to face criticism for taking money from Blavatnik, a British and American citizen whose fortune stems from privatization of Russian aluminum and other natural resources in the 1990s—now notorious as a corrupt giveaway.
“It is our considered view that Blavatnik uses his ‘philanthropy’—funds obtained by and with the consent of the Kremlin, at the expense of the state budget and the Russian people—at leading western academic and cultural institutions to advance his access to political circles,” 55 international relations scholars and Russia experts wrote in a September 18 letter to the organization’s board and CFR’s president, Richard Haass. “Such ‘philanthropic’ capital enables the infiltration of the US and UK political and economic establishments at the highest levels. It is also a means by which Blavatnik exports Russian kleptocratic practices to the West.”
“We regard this as another step in the longstanding effort of Mr. Blavatnik—who…has close ties to the Kremlin and its kleptocratic network—to launder his image in the West,” the letter says.
Five of the letter’s signatories are among the nearly 5,000 members of the think tank, a membership-based publisher of Foreign Affairs magazine and think tank. The lead authors of the letter are Ilya Zaslavskiy, a researcher at the Free Russia Foundation, who heads an initiative focused on documenting Kremlin corruption, and Sarah Chayes, author of a book on international corruption. Other signatories include Michael Carpenter, a former deputy assistant for defense with responsibility for Russia and Ukraine, David Kramer, former assistant secretary of state for democracy, Daria Kaleniuk, a prominent anti-corruption activist in Ukraine, and Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion and Russian opposition activist.
In a response to that letter, Haass, who served as the State Department’s director of policy planning under President George W. Bush, wrote that Blavatnik, like other CFR donors “has no say” in picking interns or directing research. “The Blavatnik Family Foundation has also made transformational gifts to Harvard, Yale, and Tel Aviv Universities, and established the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University,” Haass added. “We are proud to find ourselves in such distinguished company.”
In another letter addressing that argument, Zaslavskiy, Chayes and Peter Reddaway, a political science professor at George Washington University, wrote: “The fact that Harvard or Yale’s due diligence failed…does not excuse this more serious lapse.”
This exchange highlights the difficulty posed by Blavatnik, who Forbes ranked in March as the 59th richest person in the world and who claims to have dispensed more than $700 million to more than 250 nonprofit institutions over the last decade. The origin of Blavatnik’s wealth and his continued ties to sanctioned oligarchs open him to criticism. But his status as a prominent American and British citizen, his transition into the ranks of rich respectability, along with his deployment of public relations firms, have helped him avoid the label of “oligarch” and the clear Kremlin ties typical for those operating primarily in Russia.
Blavatnik, who came to the United States in the late 1970s and now lives mostly in London, is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Business School. He is best known these day as the owner of the Warner Music Group. He regularly attends the Grammy Awards.
But his fortune stems from the privatization of industries in the former Soviet Union, in particular aluminum and oil. He was among the victors in Russia’s so-called  “aluminum wars,” the sometimes murderous competition for control of Russian aluminum assets in the early 1990s. (Blavatnik has not been personally accused of violence). In 1996, Blavatnik partnered with Viktor Vekselberg, an oligarch tied to Putin, in SUAL Partners, which owns about one quarter of Rusal, the aluminum conglomerate long controlled by Oleg Deripaska. Both Vekselberg and Derispaska have been sanctioned by the Treasury Department for using their assets to advance Russian foreign policy interests, including interference in the 2016 election.
Blavatnik, long a prolific donor to both Democrats and Republicans, veered sharply toward the GOP in 2016 and 2017, giving $3.5 million to a super PAC tied to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, among others. Through his holding company, Access Industries, Blavanik, also gave $1 million to President Donald Trump’s Inaugural Committee. These gifts drew suspicion that Blavatnik was helping to advance Russian efforts to win influence with the Trump and the GOP, allegations Blavatnik denies. ABC News reported last year that former special counsel Robert Mueller had investigated Blavatnik’s inaugural contributions, along with donations by Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater, the head of an American venture capital fund that long counted Vekselberg as its chief investor.
Blavatnik’s support for the McConnell-linked PAC drew notice this year when Rusal announced plans to invest $200 million in an aluminum plant in Kentucky. The announcement came after McConnell helped to block a bill that would have faulted the Trump administration for lifting US sanctions on Rusal.
More recently, Blavatnik has given lavishly to Democrats. He and his wife gave a combined $250,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in June, following donations of around $234,000 to the DCCC in 2018. The DCCC did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Backing incumbents and the parties in control of both chambers of Congress, Blavatnik seems to be supporting the status quo in Washington.
Blavatnik has consistently denied any political affiliation with Russia. In a statement, an Access Industries spokesman said: “Mr. Blavatnik has been an American citizen since 1984 and has, for more than a decade, donated to both Democratic and Republican parties, as well as to individual candidates who promote a pro-business, pro-Israel agenda. His donations are a matter of public record and comply with all legal requirements. He has no dealings with the Russian government or its leaders.”
Controversy over Blavatnik’s gift to CFR follows similar reactions to his gifts to other organizations. Oxford University, and London’s Victoria and Albert Museum have defended decisions to name facilities after Blavatnik. Harvard Medical School houses 11 basic and social science departments in the Blavatnik Institute, the result of a $200 million dollar gift last year. The school has shrugged off a smattering of criticism for this, including one alumnus who called the school accepting the money “appalling” due to Blavatnik’s history of deals with “individuals with checkered pasts, deep Kremlin ties and a reputation for corruption.”
The only organization that seems to have returned Blavatnik’s money is the right-leaning Hudson Institute. Last year, Charles Davidson, stepped down as head of the Kleptocracy Initiative, a Hudson effort to study how corruption and illicit financial flows threaten US democracy, saying he made that decision after learning that the think tank had accepted $25,000 from Blavatnik. “Blavatnik is precisely what the Kleptocracy Initiative is fighting against—the influence of Putin’s oligarchs on America’s political system and society—and the importation of corrupt Russian business practices and values,” Davidson told the New York Post. After that article, the organization returned the donation to Blavatnik, according to a person close to Hudson. A Hudson spokeswoman declined to say when the gift was returned or to comment on it.
Blavatnik’s businesses have been faulted for questionable practices. His firms have been accused of abusing the federal bankruptcy process, and was fined by the Federal Trade Commission in 2016 for violating anti-trust laws by repeatedly failing to report stock purchases within a required timeframe. But that record is not abnormal among corporate chiefs. And he has never been charged with a crime.
There is little evidence that Blavatnik, through his donations, is purposefully advancing Russian interests. He is seemingly engaged instead in a bid to use a large amount of questionably obtained money to buy influence and prestige. Leading US institutions have little problem benefiting from that. That’s a pretty American issue.
*This article has been updated to reflect that the Hudson Institute returned $25,000, not $50,000, donated by Leonard Blavatnik.

After being diagnosed and successfully treated for ovarian cancer a decade earlier, she recognized the pain and bleeding she began to experience during intercourse, and the sudden irregularity of her periods, as signs of a potentially serious problem with her reproductive health.
Moore, a 45-year-old respiratory nurse from Atlanta, was terrified that her cancer had returned. But when she sought help from her doctors in 2012, she left her appointments with a series of misdiagnoses: perimenopause, cysts, fibroids. “Being in the medical world, I thought I knew how to communicate with my caregivers,” she says. But even as she pressed her fears, it felt like no one was listening.
She returned to her doctors repeatedly over the next three years, but her symptoms didn’t improve. When her employers switched her health insurance plan, and her monthly premium jumped, Moore became unable to afford specialist care. As the pain grew unbearable, she requested sick leave from work. Instead, she was laid off. Her family paid out of pocket for scans and tests that Moore herself ordered. Still, doctors found nothing wrong.
But growing in Moore’s pelvic cavity, across her ovaries and into the endometrium—the lining of her womb—was a disease that could kill her.
Endometrial cancer is the most common type of gynecological cancer in the United States. Four times more common than cervical cancer, and the fourth most common cancer in women, it’s one of the few cancers in the country for which diagnoses and deaths are on the rise. The American Cancer Society estimates that at least 57,000 women will be diagnosed this year, and more than 11,000 will die.
Black women are just as likely to get endometrial cancer as white women, but they are more likely to die from it. “Within every age, within every stage of diagnosis, within every tumor type, black women do worse,” says Dr. Kemi Doll, a gynecologic oncologist at the University of Washington.
Doll has spent the past seven years researching gynecological cancers and investigating the cause of the disparity. She believes that, as with racial discrepancies in other medical conditions, the difference in the endometrial cancer death rate is the result of how the medical establishment treats black women.
To start, black women are less likely than white women to receive an early diagnosis for the disease. As a result, thousands discover they have the cancer only after it has spread, when they have less chance of survival.
That could be because doctors miss early signs of the disease, or because many black women are more reluctant or less able than their white counterparts to seek help from doctors. For many black women, confidence in the health care system has been undermined by decades of difficult experiences. Studies have found that doctors are more likely to view black patients as medically uncooperative, and that diagnostic and treatment decisions are influenced by patients’ race. Black patients consistently report higher levels of dissatisfaction with their care and mistrust of their doctors. Doll says that patients she speaks with frequently describe feeling dismissed, ignored, or overwhelmed. “If you consider a black woman in the US who has had a lifetime of experiences of subpar reproductive health care,” Doll says, “it might not be that a couple of drops of postmenopausal bleeding has you running to the doctor.”
And even those, like Moore, who seek help early for endometrial cancer receive less aggressive care. A recent study conducted by Doll’s team found that black women with health insurance or access to medical care were less likely than white women to receive biopsies that could confirm their cancer earlier. Another found that 40 percent of the black-white mortality gap in endometrial cancer may be due to inequitable surgery rates: research shows that black women are less likely to receive surgery than white women at every stage of the disease, and they are also less likely to receive chemotherapy.
For further proof, Doll points to the racial discrepancies that exist in other diseases. Black women are less likely than white women to be tested for hereditary genetic mutations linked to breast cancer. Black patients with end-stage renal disease are less likely to be considered appropriate candidates for kidney transplants. Compared with white patients, black patients are more likely to die from breast, prostate, and stomach cancer, more likely to develop Alzheimer’s, and more likely to have a stroke. When it comes to maternal care, black women are almost four times more likely to die a pregnancy-related death than white women, and more likely to experience pregnancy complications like preeclampsia, placental abruptions, and postpartum hemorrhage.
“You can either approach it from the standpoint that there is something fundamentally wrong with black women’s bodies, or there’s something wrong with the way we treat black women and their bodies,” Doll says. “We are not going to help women, and we are not going to solve this problem, if we don’t deal with the problem of race and racism.”
Not everyone agrees entirely with Doll’s prognosis. Dr. Rodney Rocconi, interim director of the University of South Alabama Mitchell Cancer Institute, believes that biology plays an important part in endometrial cancer’s mortality disparity. Rocconi points to the fact that black women are more likely to be diagnosed with an aggressive form of endometrial cancer, regardless of how early she is diagnosed.
Rocconi’s research has found that women with a higher percentage of African ancestry are significantly more likely to have a genetic mutation that allows tumors to grow unchecked. Other research corroborates this idea: certain genetic mechanisms that help suppress tumors are less active in black women. Studies of kidney disease and hypertension suggest that genetics may also play part in increasing black people’s risk of developing the illnesses.
Critics argue that research linking race, genetics, and disease veers troublingly close to endorsing theories of eugenics and promoting pseudo-scientific racism. Rocconi agrees that “there’s no such thing as a black gene.” But identifying a concrete link between black women’s genetics and the aggressive tumors they suffer could be the first step in finding a cure. “What’s most exciting to me is that we can target” the biological cause of the disease, Rocconi says. Once the research is confirmed, “we can add a targeted therapy to inhibit that immune pathway, and make patients more likely to respond to therapy.”
But progress is hampered by another racial discrepancy, this time in clinical trials. Black enrollment numbers for early-phase endometrial cancer clinical trials, Rocconi notes, are dismal: For even one white person enrolled, 0.04 black people are. “That first phase in clinical trials helps set the pipeline for agents that can be used in patients,” Rocconi says. “We are self-selecting [therapies] that work in the majority white population.” This is a widespread problem. A recent ProPublica investigation found that in trials for 18 drugs targeting cancers that occur at least as frequently in black people as white, on average only 4.1 percent of participants were black.
To increase participation, Rocconi says, doctors must find a way to garner black patients’ trust in medical institutions. In Alabama, where the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment remains in living memory, Rocconi has had success enrolling more black patients in cancer treatment trials thanks to a University of South Alabama peer support program that helps patients understand treatment plans and medications and access things like medical insurance, hospital transportation, and community services. “These were black women who were talking to people from the same community,” Rocconi says. “They were advocates for them.”
Rocconi’s and Doll’s research converge in another way, too: Both researchers believe epigenetics, the idea that social, economic, and cultural inequalities can alter our DNA, might also have a role in explaining why more black women are dying from endometrial cancer. Since the inequalities black women face persist throughout lifetimes, “the resulting epigenetic changes keep accumulating…resulting in poorer health outcomes, including cancer,” among certain racial and ethnic groups, a study co-written by Rocconi asserts. In other words, black women’s genes may predispose them to aggressive endometrial cancer. But those genes have been influenced by generations of inequality.
This is why Doll believes that her patients’ experiences are key. “The genetic information that you’re getting comes from a person who had an experience,” she says. “And if you don’t look at that experience you simply won’t ever know how it may be influencing what you’re seeing on the genetic level.”
Back in Atlanta, Adrienne Moore was determined to find answers to what was ailing her. When she started a new job, a year after being laid off, she used her reinstated health benefits to order a biopsy on one of her cysts. It confirmed what she thought she already knew: She had cancer. But when the oncologist described the disease, she was shocked. She had never heard of endometrial cancer before. Her disease was so advanced, she was diagnosed at Stage 3. She was lucky to survive.
As she finished chemotherapy, Moore joined the Endometrial Cancer Action Network for African-Americans, a national support group founded by Doll. The organization hosts an online community for survivors and an education arm that informs black women about the disease, and its members serve as a research pool for ongoing studies into the cancer’s causes and treatments. Moore, whose cancer is now in remission, is a patient advisor for ECANA and conducts outreach to black women across Georgia.
“There’s such a silence around our reproductive health,” says Moore. She feels she had a lucky escape. “When black women tell me they’ve never heard of endometrial cancer,” she says, “it’s probably because we’ve lost so many to this disease.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Even Anti-Abortion Groups Doubt They’ll Work.,Jessica Washington,MotherJones,Politics,"On October 1, a federal judge blocked a Georgia law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. On the very same day, a nearly identical bill was introduced in the Florida state legislature.
For every legal setback to the recent efforts by Republican state lawmakers to impose effective blanket bans on abortion, there’s been another push to pass new ones. But with the courts in seeming unanimous agreement on the unconstitutionality of these measures, even anti-abortion groups are doubting the wisdom of the slew of bans.
The Florida bill, filed by Republican state Rep. Mike Hill, would ban abortions when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, generally around six weeks, which is often before a woman is aware of her pregnancy. The bill would also make it a felony for doctors to perform these abortions, punishable by up to five years in prison.
South Carolina legislators are also considering a bill that would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected and make providing an abortion after that point a criminal offense. Nine states have passed bans on abortion pre-viability: Georgia, Ohio, Kentucky, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, Utah, and Arkansas.
The confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in October of 2018 spurred many state legislatures to pass abortion bans in the hopes of getting a case to the Supreme Court that could overturn Roe v. Wade.  “In 10 to 15 states for the last 30 years, legislators have passed anti-abortion laws that in their view move the envelope toward further restricting the right to abortion,” says Stephen Wermiel, a constitutional law professor at American University. “Now, with Kavanaugh replacing [Anthony] Kennedy, I think the states feel a strong interest in trying to push farther to see one of two things: either if they can get Roe overturned altogether or if they can significantly advance restrictions on abortion.”
However, so far none of these laws have been upheld by federal judges. Without a split among the federal courts on the abortion bans, Wermiel says, the Supreme Court is unlikely to take up any of these cases.
“I think the Supreme Court isn’t sitting around anxious to have to decide one of these,” he says. “The real question will be: Does the court have to pick one of those cases [as a result of] the federal appeals courts being in conflict? But so far, none of the federal courts have upheld any of these pre-viability bans.”
Major anti-abortion organizations such as Americans United for Life have openly spoken out against these bans, arguing that they are not the best strategy to roll back abortion access.
“They are not likely to make it to the Supreme Court,” says Steven Aden, chief legal officer for Americans United for Life. “For that reason, we think there are other more productive means of the state expressing its respect for life.”
Aden argues that it’s more effective to pass laws such as a 2014 Louisiana measure that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Those privileges can be very difficult for abortion providers to obtain, because hospitals are unlikely to provide admitting privileges to doctors who almost never bring in patients. (Fewer than1 percent of women experience complications from abortions.) In Louisiana, the admitting privileges requirement would leave only one abortion provider in the entire state. The Louisiana law is currently before the Supreme Court. “What Louisiana has done with admitting privileges is appropriate,” says Aden.
While the Louisiana law is the only abortion-related case currently before the Supreme Court, conservative state legislatures are likely to continue pushing abortion bans, says Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization focused on reproductive health. “Where we are seeing these bans move and get enacted are states where in recent years they have passed restriction after restriction after restriction,” she says. “So in some ways this is really the last thing to do.”
In addition, Nash believes lawmakers are motivated by a desire to seem tough on abortion. “I also think that states are looking to try to jockey for most anti-abortion state in the country,” she says, adding, “This gins up their base and proves their conservative bona fides.”
Abortion-related legislation tends to drop off in major election years, given how controversial it is. But Nash thinks 2020 may be different. “I feel like abortion will be an election issue, and for conservatives perhaps in a different way because of the Supreme Court, because of the threat to Roe,” she says, adding, “I can imagine that we are going to see more on abortion bans in 2020.”
Even though the Supreme Court has yet to take up any of the abortion bans, Wermiel argues that these laws pose the most direct threat to Roe v. Wade.
“The interesting [thing] about the bans is, probably more than anything else, they would force the Supreme Court to confront overruling the right to abortion,” he says. “Because you can’t essentially say bans after six weeks are not an undue burden on a woman’s ability to get an abortion. The court can’t simply uphold the ban and say it doesn’t violate the right to abortion…So if the court gets one of those cases and takes it, it almost certainly has to confront the question of overruling Roe.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

As many as five billion people will face hunger and a lack of clean water by 2050 as the warming climate disrupts pollination, freshwater, and coastal habitats, according to new research published last week in Science. People living in South Asia and Africa will bear the worst of it.
Climate activists have been telling us for a while now that global warming isn’t just about the polar bears, so it’s hardly breaking news that humans are going to suffer because nature is suffering. But what is new about this model is the degree of geographic specificity. It pinpoints the places where projected environmental losses overlap with human populations who depend on those resources and maps them with a nifty interactive viewer.
This model identifies not just the general ways climate change harms the environment and how people will feel those changes, but also where these changes will likely occur, and how significant they’ll be. It’s an unprecedented degree of detail for a global biodiversity model.
Patricia Balvanera, a professor of biodiversity at National University of Mexico who wasn’t involved in the study, said the new model “provides an extremely important tool to inform policy decisions and shape responses.”
The model looks at three specific natural systems that humans benefit from: pollination (which enables crops to grow), freshwater systems (which provide drinking water), and coastal ecosystems (which provide a buffer from storm surges and prevent erosion). Using fine-scale satellite imagery, the team of scientists mapped predicted losses to these natural systems onto human population maps. The resulting map allows you to see how many people could be impacted by environmental changes, and where.
“We were specifically trying to look at how nature is changing in delivering [a] benefit, and then where it overlaps with people’s needs,” said Rebecca Chaplin-Kramer, the lead scientist at the Natural Capital Project, a Stanford University-based research group that produced the study.
To understand why the Natural Capital Project’s model is groundbreaking, you need to understand a little bit about past attempts to gauge how the environmental effects of climate change will impact people. It’s a pretty hard thing to do—natural processes are interconnected systems, and many of the ways that humans benefit from these natural processes (what scientists call “ecosystem services” or “nature’s contributions to humanity”) aren’t obvious.
“The real challenge, with nature’s contributions to people, is that it benefits us in so many ways that it’s sort of mind-boggling,” Chaplin-Kramer said. “It’s just so abstract that it tends to be disregarded.”
The Natural Capital Project’s model was initially intended to support the massive UN biodiversity report released this spring. That report coalesced 15,000 scientific studies into the most comprehensive survey ever done of how climate change threatens global biodiversity—science-speak for “every living thing.” Even if you didn’t read the whole thing, you probably saw headlines like “One million species at risk of extinction, UN report warns.” The IPBES report included a 200-odd page chapter that laid out how all the different things we could see happen to nature will affect people — depending on how humanity reacts in the next few decades to the climate crisis.
But the IPBES report bumped up against one of the biggest challenges when it comes to quantifying nature’s contributions to humankind: Most occur on a local scale. “Spatial context really matters,” said Chaplin-Kramer. “It’s not just the total amount of nature we have, but where we have it, and if it’s in the place where it can deliver the most benefits to people.”
Bee pollinator habitats, for example, only provide benefits to people if they’re within a few miles of the farms that grow our food. Plants that filter nitrogen out of a stream are only “useful” for humans if they’re downstream of the pollution source and upstream of the population. So while the IPBES was able to offer lots of predictions about the aggregate consequences of biodiversity loss—e.g., food supplies will suffer as we lose habitats for bees—they weren’t able to say specifically where they’d occur.
The new model does more than illustrate a problem with great detail—the framework behind it also has the potential to be a powerful tool for avoiding the worst effects of climate change. It could help people prepare for the catastrophes it forecasts.
Unai Pascual, a lead author of the IPBES report and co-author of the Science article, sees this model as taking the IPBES report’s findings a step further, translating a conceptual framework “into something that really can be applied.”
Scientists and non-scientists alike are interested in understanding how to maximize the benefits provided by nature. Just this week a study published in Science Advances found that biologically diverse fields yielded more crops than farms practicing monoculture. Iowan farmers are finding that planting strips of land that mimic native prairies has a range of benefits. In China, a national “Ecological Redline Policy” takes ecosystem services into account in zoning decisions.
These sorts of programs will be more necessary as climate change continues to threaten ecosystems around the world, and policymakers and businesses are increasingly looking to scientists for information about how to protect the natural resources humans need most.
Chaplin-Kramer’s team is working with the World Bank to develop a “Natural Capital” index so that countries can track the condition of their natural resources. They’re also working on an optimization framework to figure out which interventions will have the greatest impact. That will help policymakers use this information to implement conservation policies in the places where, as Chaplin-Kramer put it, “you can get the most bang for your buck.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

If It Happens, the Ecosystem Will Be in Chaos.",Matt Simon,MotherJones,Environment,"This story was originally published by Wired and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.
The Trump administration this week proposed ending the so-called Roadless Rule, which banned logging, development, and road construction in Alaska’s Tongass, the biggest national forest in the US. If the USDA Forest Service has its way, it would “remove all 9.2 million acres of inventoried roadless acres and would convert 165,000 old-growth acres and 20,000 young-growth acres previously identified as unsuitable timber lands to suitable timber lands.”
If you’re thinking that opening up the Tongass for road-building and logging might have some environmental consequences, it’s actually far worse than you can imagine. Clear-cutting the Tongass, or even just laying down roads, will have hidden yet dire knock-on effects that ripple through this dynamic ecosystem and even spread to rivers and the sea.
When logging removes trees, it doesn’t just assault the biodiversity of the local vegetation. For one, opening up a gash in the forest changes the dynamics of what you leave intact. In this part of the world, it’s usually too wet for the forests to refresh with wildfires, which in places like California clear out brush to make way for new growth. Instead, the Tongass relies on heavy winds to blow over trees, dispensing with the old and making room for the new to grow.
That natural process is supercharged if humans modify the environment. “Once you have a clear cut, then the remaining trees or the edge of the forest becomes much more susceptible to what we think of as windthrow, or wind disturbance,” says Northern Arizona University ecologist Michelle Mack, who studies forests. This exposure also imperils species like moss, which rely on a moist, dark environment to thrive, but are now left to dry out in the wind and sun. You see the same thing happening with deforestation in the Amazon: Leaving islands of rainforest surrounded by farmland doesn’t just trap the animals there—it transforms the dynamics of vegetation at the edges.
Gouging a road through the Tongass will have the same effect, as vegetation on either side struggles to cope with the exposure. And add to that stress the potential to introduce invasive species as the area develops. “One nice thing about most Alaskan forests and tundra is they’re relatively resistant to invasion,” says Mack. Roads and clear-cuts, she says, remove some of that protection. Equipment brought in from afar might carry seeds that can take root and out-compete native species, as well as winged insects that can spread even faster in the stressed-out forest.
In a healthy forest like the Tongass, the tree canopy captures rain and snow, a process known as interception. This actually controls the amount of water runoff in the ecosystem, as what’s caught in the canopy evaporates back into the atmosphere. “So when we remove the forest canopy, we remove this protective layer,” says John Pomeroy, a hydrologist at the University of Saskatchewan. “We have much more snow and rain hitting the forest floor—or what was the forest floor.”
With fewer trees the soil can come loose, which all that extra water picks up and washes into rivers, where it either directly kills fish by choking the water with muck or indirectly by cutting off the light for aquatic vegetation like eelgrass, in which fish species breed. From the rivers the sediment flows into lakes and the sea, altering those environments too. “The erosion sometimes can be spectacular,” says Pomeroy. “It can be massive landslides, saturated hill slopes collapsing downstream.”
As these habitats falter, processes hidden underground descend into chaos. Networks of fungi known as mycorrhizae, which form symbiotic relationships with tree roots to move nutrients and water, begin to fragment. “They can even move water uphill,” says Pomeroy. “Once the trees are dead, you lose the whole microbial ecosystem that relies on being under the forest canopy.” Soil chemistry can also change dramatically, as the dynamics between water and trees shift.
In the Tongass, all these complex interactions have developed over centuries. So if you clear-cut a forest, it’s not just going to bounce back in a couple years, fully stocked with all the original organisms acting out their original relationships. “Sure, you can cut a tree and get another tree to grow and it will start to look big after three decades, but it won’t begin to function like those old-growth trees for many, many centuries,” says Pomeroy.
Not only are mature forests managing water supplies, they’re managing their local climate as well: A northern forest’s surface temperature on a summer day hovers around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, while a clear-cut area is more like 100 degrees. And old-growth forests affect the global climate, too, by capturing CO2 and helping save us from this mess we’ve made.
The challenge, says Rick Steiner—who runs the conservation group Oasis Earth, in Anchorage—is that the threat is coming both on a federal level from the Trump administration and on the state level from the governorship of Mike Dunleavy. Dunleavy, according to The Washington Post, has asked Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to exempt Tongass from logging limits. “They see dollar signs in the forest, they don’t see trees in the habitat,” says Steiner. “And it’s about as bad as it has ever been here in Alaska right now. It’s unbelievable.”
Now more than ever, we have to see the forest for the trees, or face ecological doom.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney went on Fox News on Sunday to attempt to explain statements he made this week involving President Donald Trump and Ukraine. It didn’t go well.
Here’s the backstory: Mulvaney made a stunning admission on Thursday that yes, the Trump administration withheld aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into a debunked conspiracy theory about Democrats and election hacking in 2016. It was, as he affirmed, a quid pro quo. Hours later, Mulvaney issued a statement walking those comments back. Both Democrats and Republicans criticized the statements.
Mulvaney went on Fox News Sunday to do a little more damage control. Host Chris Wallace didn’t waste any time asking Mulvaney directly about the remarks.
“Why did you say, in that briefing, that President Trump had ordered a quid pro quo that aid to Ukraine depended on investigating the Democrats?” Wallace asked.
“Again, that’s not what I said,” Mulvaney replied. He went on to say that the United States held up the aid due to “rampant corruption” in Ukraine and concerns about European nations failing to help with foreign aid.
Wallace didn’t let up. He played the footage from Thursday’s briefing. Watch the exchange below:

Mulvaney also addressed Trump’s announcement on Twitter late Saturday that the G7 summit would not be held at the president’s Doral resort in Florida. In an effort to seemingly smooth over concerns about a conflict of interest on the president’s part, Mulvaney made matters worse for Trump by saying, “At the end of the day [the president] still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.”

For most of 1973, Nixon’s presidency trudged along, despite the must-see-TV hearings held by the Senate Watergate Committee and the appointment of Archibald Cox as special prosecutor. But on October 12, a federal appeals court ruled that Nixon had to give up official documents and recordings to Cox. Eight days later, on Saturday, October 20, Nixon demanded that his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, fire Cox. Richardson refused to do so and resigned from his position; Nixon then demanded the same of Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus. He also refused and resigned. The third in line for the task, Solicitor General Robert Bork, finally complied with Nixon’s order.
The Saturday Night Massacre became known as a turning point in the timeline that eventually led to Nixon’s historic resignation. As the late journalist Helen Thomas remembered it in a 2009 interview, “These things don’t happen in America.

They will not silence us,” Gabbard says before making a plea to viewers to join her in “speaking truth to power.” “Don’t be afraid.”

Gabbard’s video is the latest in a series of responses following Clinton’s Thursday appearance on a podcast with former Obama adviser David Plouffe. Clinton told Plouffe the Russians were “grooming” a Democratic candidate to be a third-party candidate, without directly mentioning Gabbard by name. “I’m not making any predictions, but I think they’ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said. “She’s the favorite of the Russians.”
Gabbard was quick to take aim at Clinton, calling her “the queen of warmongers” and “the embodiment of corruption” in a Friday tweet that soon went viral.

Gabbard also told an NBC reporter on Saturday the comments were part of a “smear campaign” “coming from people like Hillary Clinton and her proxies, the foreign policy establishment, the military-industrial complex, who obviously feel threatened by my message and by my campaign because they know that they can’t control me.”
The video Gabbard released Sunday doesn’t explicitly mention Clinton’s recent comments, but it appears to be a direct response to the feud between the two.
Democratic presidential candidates Andrew Yang, former Texas representative Beto O’Rourke, and Marianne Williamson have come to Gabbard’s defense. Pete Buttigieg said he didn’t want to “get in the middle” of the battle but said he wasn’t comfortable with Clinton’s comments.
Meanwhile, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker had perhaps the most memorable response to Gabbard’s tweet on Friday:

My goodness. I guess Democrats must be taking a pummeling as Trump’s approval rating climbs and climbs. Let’s take a look:
Huh. After six months of blitzing, Trump’s net approval rating has gone down from -8.2 to -11.5. It’s almost as if all those outrageous online ads have had no appreciable effect on anyone but Trump’s base, which already approved of him anyway.
It’s possible, of course, that without all the online ads Trump’s approval rating would have dropped even more. However, it’s also possible that incendiary online ads are mostly a waste of money because they appeal only to true believers in the first place. I think the latter is more likely.
Now, there’s nothing wrong with keeping your base worked up. It’s a time-honored strategy, and Democrats will be doing it too once they agree on a candidate. But Trump isn’t going to win in 2020 with a base strategy. His base is just way too small. He’s going to win—if he wins—by taking some votes from the middle. He might or might not do that via social media, but he definitely won’t do it with obviously scurrilous ads. That’s the kind of thing that turns off moderates.
Bottom line: don’t worry too much about the fact that Trump is able to lie online, especially this far ahead of Election Day. It may keep his base frothing at the mouth, but that’s about all. It’s not the game changer people sometimes make it out to be.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Compromising on this (on Facebook), he argued, would stifle their free speech, which would be bad for society.
“Our mutual commitment to each other—that we hold each others’ right to express our views and be heard above our own desire to always get the outcomes we want—is how we make progress together,” he said.
“In the face of these tensions…a popular impulse is to pull back from free expression. We’re at another crossroads,” Zuckerberg read at another point, stressing that “the bigger story has always been regular people using their voice to take billions of individual steps forward to make our lives and our communities better. I believe in giving people a voice because, at the end of the day, I believe in people.”
Not only did this approach ignore the fact that, at least domestically, free speech is not imperiled, but it also skipped over something vital: how, or whether, Facebook can fulfill his vision that elevating free speech and giving people a voice makes anything better. While favoring abstract and theoretical—and not necessarily untrue—arguments about how connecting people and free speech can be good, the Facebook CEO made almost no effort to show how, in its 15 years of existence, Facebook actually helps serve those ends.
Maybe Zuckerberg and company think that Facebook’s contributions to these things are self-evident, but they aren’t. What is far more evident is how Facebook has undermined the well being of large swaths of the world by giving platforms to people who want to weaponize speech.
Free speech and more social cohesion, handled in a sustainable, responsible way, are unequivocally good, but Zuckerberg and Facebook no longer have the public confidence to warrant uncritical trust that they’ll handle these issues sustainably and responsibly. Over the last several years, United Nations investigators have said that Facebook helped exacerbate genocide in Myanmar, played a role in radicalizing people to dangerous ideologies, gave Russian trolls a tool to influence the 2016 presidential election and, more generally, created a forum for the rapid dissemination of misinformation.
None of that even very limited selection of the company’s missteps came up in the speech, though Zuckerberg did briefly deviate from talking vaguely about theory to sprinkle in examples of the historic value of free speech—citing points of history that Facebook never existed in and wouldn’t be relevant to.
“In times of social tension, our impulse is often to pull back from free expression because we want the progress that comes in from free expression, but we don’t want this tension,” Zuckerberg said citing examples of how Martin Luther King Jr. was constitutionally jailed for peacefully protesting, efforts to stymy student protests of the Vietnam War, and the Supreme Court’s ruling that Eugene Debs could be imprisoned for criticizing World War I.
“In the end all of these decisions were wrong,” he solemnly told the crowd. In each of these examples that Zuckerberg plucked from high school American history lessons, the conflict is between dissidents and oppressive state power. Facebook is neither, and at this point arguably resembles the latter far more than the former.
With even its own CEO stumbling to marshal evidence for his case, it’s hard to see how Facebook’s connect-people-at-all-costs mission will bend the arc of history towards justice like Zuckerberg says it will, especially given how the platform has recently helped elevate so many bad things.
Zuckerberg did make a brief, passing effort to nod to ways that Facebook has benefited America, mentioning his platform’s role in the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements. But neither example stands up to scrutiny.
“Movements like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo went viral on Facebook—the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was actually first used on Facebook—and this just wouldn’t have been possible in the same way before,” he said.
His particular claim—that the first mention of Black Lives Matter was on Facebook—is true, but so is the fact the white supremacist 2017 Unite The Right Rally in Charlottesville was also organized on Facebook, with the company only taking down the event page one day before the event. And Black Lives Matter probably didn’t need Facebook to thrive; the company just happened to have the dominant social media platform at the time when a community organizer first used the phrase in 2013. And yes, while #MeToo did go viral on Facebook, it first did so on Twitter and started even earlier on MySpace. It’s unlikely that Zuckerberg’s social media platform was necessary for the movement, which was charged by the work of investigative journalists.
The problems Facebook has helped cause—facilitating the spread of misinformation, exacerbating genocide, contributing to radicalization, giving massive platforms to the most incendiary and least substantive content producers—happened specifically because of how Facebook was designed to make the company’s executives, owners, and shareholders money. That’s a very real benefit accruing to a very small group.
Perhaps there are other, revolutionary benefits to Facebook. The company certainly has a vast and vast and transformative reach. If Zuckerberg wants people to believe that that’s helping society though, he should probably figure out how.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Brady Toensing—whose mother Victoria Toensing and and step-father Joe diGenova are key players in the rapidly growing Ukraine scandal—joined the DOJ in June as a senior counsel in its Office of Legal Policy.
The DOJ won’t say how Brady Toensing got the job, but the entire family has close ties to Trump. In 2016, Brady Toensing served as Trump’s Vermont campaign chair. Last year, Victoria Toensing and diGenova—a husband-and-wife legal team who frequently appear on Fox News—agreed to represent Trump in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. That arrangement quickly fell through, but the couple has since worked with Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani to dig up damaging information on Joe Biden in Ukraine and advance bogus theories about the origin of the Russia probe. They also represent Dmytro Firtash, a Kremlin-linked Ukrainian oligarch fighting extradition to the United States on bribery charges. Firtash reportedly employed two Giuliani associates who were involved in the effort to smear Biden and were arrested last week on campaign finance charges.
There’s no evidence that Brady Toensing’s new role, which was first reported by Vermont outlets in June, would intersect with his family’s legal work. The Office of Legal Policy typically deals with DOJ-wide policies and judicial appointments, and Brady Toensing told friends when he took the job that he would be working on nominations—including helping pick a Supreme Court nominee to fill any potential vacancy, one source said. DOJ has not responded to multiple inquiries about what, exactly, his work entails. Brady Toensing directed questions to a Justice Department spokesman.
On Friday that DOJ spokesman said: “Under the OGE ethics standards, since Brady Toensing joined the Department of Justice he is recused from being involved in matters relating to his former firm, including matters that arose before or after his departure from the firm.”
Reached by phone Monday, Victoria Toensing declined to speak on the record and hung up abruptly.
Brady Toensing says in an online bio that he worked for his mother and step-father’s firm, diGenova & Toensing, from 1996 until he joined DOJ. That included the six-day period between the announcement that the firm would join Trump’s defense team and the news it would not do so due to conflicts of interests resulting from its representation of other clients involved in the Trump-Russia scandal, including Blackwater Founder Erik Prince, former Trump legal team spokesman Mark Corallo, and the former Trump campaign aide Sam Clovis. It’s not clear if the family firm actually did any legal work for Trump during that period, but diGenova and Victoria Toensing have since functioned almost as de facto members of Trump’s defense, promoting his interests on television and elsewhere and sharing information with Giuliani that he has disseminated in the media.
For decades, dating to their involvement in efforts to impeach President Bill Clinton, diGenova and Victoria Toensing have combined legal work with outspoken right-wing punditry on Fox News and in conservative publications. On Fox last week, diGenova, who regularly touts conspiracy theories regarding alleged plots against Trump, referred to two anonymous whistleblowers in the Ukraine scandal as “suicide bombers.” He accused Democrats investigating Trump of “sedition” and “regicide,” a word that suggests unconventional views about American democracy.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

When the first locally acquired case of Valley fever was diagnosed in Washington in 2010, health officials were stunned. The disease had only appeared in the state in patients who had recently traveled to the warm and dry corners of the Southwest, said Heather Hill, a communicable disease expert for the Benton-Franklin Health District in south-central Washington. But since that time, the disease has been found east of the Cascade Mountains, where an active agricultural industry, and hot, dry summers provide conditions for the disease to thrive. “It’s probably salted all across eastern Washington,” Hill said.
Now, new research suggests that Valley fever will continue to spread as the climate changes. This growth is a reflection of a greater trend across the nation as mosquito-borne West Nile virus and tick-borne Lyme disease also expand their range.
As more Western communities come into contact with new diseases, public health officials are grappling with how to report risks without generating unnecessary fear. Recent history has shown that poor communication only aggravates the problem, leading to public panic and a loss of trust in the government’s ability to handle outbreaks. Today, people like Hill are striving to learn from past mistakes and develop better communication strategies as climate change fuels the spread of diseases.
Valley fever, or coccidioidomycosis, is caused by the soil-dwelling fungus Coccidioides. It’s most common in hot, dry places like California’s San Joaquin Valley and Arizona. When activities like construction or plowing disturb the soil, the fungus can become airborne, releasing invisible spores that can lodge inside the lungs of humans and other animals. Over half of those infected will catch a mild illness that mimics the flu. But in rare cases—less than 1%—the infection spreads from the lungs to the rest of the body, with consequences that can be deadly.
With climate change, more states are becoming hotter and more arid, creating the perfect environment for the fungus to grow, said Morgan Gorris, a former Ph.D. student in earth system science at the University of California Irvine. Gorris and her colleagues published a study this August predicting that by 2100, the fungus’ range could grow from 12 to 17 states, including Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. The number of people who contract the disease may also increase from around 10,000 to 15,000 cases a year.
Given statistics like these, it’s imperative for state officials to understand what is causing infectious diseases to move from one region to another. One factor is climate change, which is creating more environments where such illnesses can thrive. Take Lyme disease: With higher annual temperatures, ticks are more abundant and have increased opportunities to infect their hosts, according to a 2018 study. In the coming decades, cases of Lyme disease in the U.S. could rise by over 20%. As the climate changes, the spread of diseases will likely become a more critical public health issue, said Gorris.
But sensationalizing outbreaks can cause unnecessary panic. In a study on media coverage of the Zika virus in 2016, researchers found that nearly half of the news stories focused on the dangers of the virus without ever mentioning how people could reduce their risks. “We can’t just throw a bunch of information at (the public),” said Tara Kirk Sell, an assistant professor in Johns Hopkins’ department of environmental health who was involved in the study. Instead, “they need information on the actions that they can take to protect themselves.”
Public health officials in Washington are trying to use more effective communication tools, focusing on clear, consistent messaging, when they talk about Valley fever. “We need to walk a fine line where we report on the data that we have (on the disease) without scaring people,” said Amy Salamone, a mycologist at the Washington State Department of Health. This means sticking to the facts, being transparent about any uncertainty, and teaching doctors and patients about how Valley fever spreads and what they can do to avoid catching it. New risk-communication trainings have also taught officials how to convey their findings on camera without causing unnecessary alarm.
There are still communication challenges, but in 37 years of working with infectious diseases, Hill has seen a positive shift. “I am seeing a more careful approach,” she said. “We know that fear-based communication doesn’t work.” Now, officials use highly targeted messaging in counties where Valley fever may be present. Their main goal is to tell people how to protect themselves; anyone exposed to dry dirt should be on their guard, for example, and patients who manifest flu-like symptoms need to tell the doctor about any recent exposure to dust.
Hill recognizes that diseases will continue to spread regardless, and time and resources will be needed to keep the public informed and prepared. “We know diseases are coming,” she said. “We know we need to be vigilant.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

There are several options left to us here:
This is rough, but it’s the basic lay of the land if we’re willing to make corporations continue to pay for health care at the same rate they pay now. They’d have no real beef since it would cost them nothing more and would free them from the overhead cost and hassle of dealing with health care. There’s also a strong chance that the head tax would rise more slowly than it does now, since government-run health programs almost invariably cap cost growth better than the private sector.

Everything Is Still Chaos.,Noah Lanard,MotherJones,Politics,"In Parliament’s first Saturday session since the Falklands war—dubbed, questionably, “Super Saturday”—Democratic Unionists from Ireland ensured the passage of the Letwin amendment to trigger a Brexit extension request required by the Benn Act. Confused? Me too. Read on.
Heading into the session, Prime Minister Boris Johnson needed the parliament to provide a “meaningful vote” in favor of his Brexit plan before an 11 P.M. deadline on Saturday. Without that support, legislation known as the Benn Act requires Johnson to ask the European Union to push the deadline for leaving the EU back from October 31 to January 31. That’s not what Johnson wants. He has staked his whole prime ministership on getting it done by the end of the month.
The House of Commons rebuffed Johnson on Saturday. In a 322-306 vote, it passed an amendment forcing Johnson to bring the Brexit withdrawal deal he hammered out with Brussels last week before them. Basically: No Brexit, until the parliament can vote on the whole thing.
Outside Parliament, streets were filled with demonstrators who oppose Johnson:

In typical fashion, Johnson is saying he won’t play by the rules—pledging he would not request an extension from EU leaders. “I will not negotiate a delay with the EU,” he said, “and neither does the law compel me to do so.”
Today’s vote could mean a mind-numbing number of new steps to pass the deal, presenting a race against time: EU leaders would need to return to Brussels to approve any new extension. Then there are the UK parliament’s own maneuvers that could continue to stymy the prime minister. And when the House of Commons does take up the deal, Members of Parliament can introduce even more amendments to shape the terms of a Brexit. Read through the thread below for more on the messy mechanics of what happens next:

A simpler take away comes from Peter Bone, a member of Johnsons’ Conservative Party who voted against the Letwin amendment. “I’m fed up. It’s been a complete waste of time. Nothing’s happened and it’s spoiled my birthday,” he said in an interview. “I have to be here talking to you, rather than eating cake.”

Although it feels strange to even type these words, some Republicans in Congress may be reaching their limits with Trump. The Washington Post reports:
Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.), who represents a district that Trump won by 22 points, has been particularly candid about his potential willingness to impeach the president—or about as candid as it gets amongst his colleagues. “I’m still thinking about it, you know?” Rooney said. “I’ve been real mindful of the fact that during Watergate, all the people I knew said, ‘Oh, they’re just abusing Nixon, and it’s a witch hunt.’ Turns out it wasn’t a witch hunt. It was really bad.”
Trump has been forcing GOP legislators to “defend the indefensible,” a senior House Republican aide told the Post. “You have to go out and try to defend him,” Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) said. “Well, I don’t know if I can do that!”
“I have no doubt that Doral is a really good place. I’ve been there, I know,” Simpson added about Trump’s decision to host next year’s Group of Seven summit at the Florida resort. “But it is politically insensitive. They should have known what the kickback is going to be on this, that politically he’s doing it for his own benefit.”
John Kasich, the former presidential candidate and Republican governor of Ohio, has also jumped on the impeachment bandwagon:

Despite the unusually forthcoming criticism, Trump still has a firm hold over most of the party he has held hostage since 2016. As a senior Senate Republican aide told New York magazine’s Olivia Nuzzi, “The White House is just like, ‘Oh, Trump will handle everything.’ Which is crazy — but it seems like that’s their strategy. It’s a depressing time.”
Nuzzi asked if anything would change for conservatives who’ve been unwilling to publicly voice voice their frustrations. “It’s all bullshit until it’s not,” the aide said. “At this point, it is bullshit. Obviously it could change, but it hasn’t. So who cares?”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The document in his hand was an affidavit from Viktor Shokin, a former top Ukrainian prosecutor who was fired in 2016 under international pressure due to his failure to combat corruption. Giuliani asserted that the affidavit supported his debunked claim that former Vice President Joe Biden had forced Shokin’s ouster to prevent Shokin from investigating a company tied to Biden’s son. But it did no such thing; the statement merely repeated an unproven allegation without backing it up. The affidavit, though, was evidence that President Donald Trump’s effort to smear his political rival has overlapped with the interests of Dmytro Firtash—a Kremlin-connected oligarch with purported ties to Russian organized crime.
What Giuliani neglected to mention on ABC that day was that this affidavit was filed in an Austrian court by lawyers for Firtash, a Ukrainian tycoon who has for years been fighting extradition to the United States, where he faces federal bribery charges. In this document, Shokin also claimed that in late 2015 Biden took steps to prevent Firtash from returning to Ukraine from Austria. This claim—for which no evidence was presented—appeared intended to support Firtash’s argument that he has been the target of a politically motivated prosecution by the US Justice Department. In other words, Shokin’s affidavit, notarized on September 4, 2019, served the interests of both Firtash and Giuliani’s client, Trump.
The affidavit filed to help Firtash—and Giuliani’s use of it to try to help Trump—is just one of several indications that the Trump-Giuliani crusade to squeeze political dirt out of Ukraine has intersected with the world of an oligarch on the run from US justice.
Firtash has hired lawyers with close ties to Trump’s defense team, and he has retained Mark Corallo, who worked as a spokesman for Trump’s attorneys during special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. But much of the cross-over involves Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who last week were arrested on campaign finance charges, including the allegation that they made secret donations to influence US policy on behalf of one or more Ukrainian government officials.
Parnas and Fruman were business associates of Giuliani. In addition, Giuliani has said that beginning in late 2018, these two men helped him pursue information in Ukraine that could benefit Trump. They connected Giuliani with former Ukrainian officials who alleged Biden had helped force out Shokin to stop him from investigating Burisma, the gas company connected to Biden’s son. Giuliani admitted this week that he was paid $500,000 by a company controlled by Parnas for what Giuliani claims was business and legal advice in 2018 and 2019.
At the same time Parnas and Fruman were collaborating with Giuliani, Firtash also was reportedly paying Parnas and Fruman. The duo gave the impression they were working with the oligarch when they attempted last year to force the replacement of the head of Ukraine’s national gas company and when they helped to cause the removal of US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, according to people familiar with their efforts. In a text exchange with Mother Jones last week, Giuliani said, “I have nothing to do with Firtash.”
Firtash is a controversial figure in Ukraine. He made a fortune—which Forbes in 2014 estimated at $500 million—by working with Russia’s Gazprom. The state-run natural gas giant gave Firtash a role as its partner in a business shipping gas from Russia to Ukraine. In 2010, Firtash was a key backer of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a pro-Russian leader accused of massive corruption. (Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chair now serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence in prison, was a top consultant for Yanukovych.)
In 2014, shortly after Yanukovych fled Ukraine during the Maidan revolution, US prosecutors in Chicago indicted Firtash for allegedly bribing Indian government officials to secure a contract to sell titanium to Boeing. He once told the US ambassador in Kiev that years earlier he had to obtain the approval of Semion Mogilevich, an alleged Russian mobster, for his initial business endeavors. The Justice Department in 2017 called Firtash an “upper-echelon [associate] of Russian organized crime,” an allegation he denies. In June, a US federal judge cleared the way for Firtash to face charges in Chicago. But he is fighting extradition from Austria, where he has been been under house arrest since 2014, arguing in court there that he was targeted for prosecution by US officials for political reasons.
This summer, Firtash hired Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing, a husband-and-wife legal team known for championing Republican causes and defending Trump on Fox News. A year earlier, diGenova and Toensing had agreed to join Trump’s defense team, but that arrangement was scuttled due to conflicts of interest caused by the couple’s prior work for other clients involved in the Trump-Russia scandal. Toensing has also worked with Giuliani to find dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. She planned to join the former New York City mayor on a trip to Kiev in May, during which they hoped to gather more negative information about Trump’s Democratic rival. They canceled the trip after the New York Times reported those plans.
Shortly after Firtash hired diGenova and Toensing, his legal team fired a shot that jointly targeted a Trump enemy and a Firtash foe. They submitted a brief to an Austrian court arguing that an effort by Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann to convince Firtash to cooperate with the Russia probe demonstrated that the Justice Department’s case against Firtash was politically motivated.
Firtash’s interests intersect with the Trump-Ukraine scandal in other ways, as well. Reuters reported last week that since at least early 2018, Firtash has employed Parnas and Fruman. A source familiar with the two men’s actions told Mother Jones that, earlier this year, they “told people that Firtash was paying them.” Toensing has called claims that Firtash was in business with Parnas and Fruman “a crock,” though she says she hired Parnas this summer to work on Firtash’s defense team as an interpreter.
As Parnas and Fruman helped Giuliani do opposition research for Trump, they were also pursuing a lucrative natural gas deal involving Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state-run oil and gas company. At an energy conference in Houston in March, Parnas and Fruman—accompanied by Harry Sargeant III, a billionaire oil magnate who lives in Florida—met with Andrew Favorov, a top deputy to Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev. As the AP first reported, Parnas and Fruman pressed Favorov to agree to a plan in which they would help him replace Kobolyev as Naftogaz’s chief. Parnas and Fruman hoped to then partner with Favorov on a scheme to export up to 100 tankers per year of US liquified gas to Naftogaz, which is eager to reduce its reliance on Russian gas. Favorov reportedly rejected this proposal, which he perceived as “a shakedown,” the AP story said.
During this meeting, Parnas and Fruman gave the impression that they were working with Firtash, according to Dale Perry, an American gas executive who does business in Ukraine. Perry tells Mother Jones that Parnas and Fruman informed Favorov that they wanted Naftogaz to pay Firtash $200 million he claims the company owes him. Perry, who did not attend the meeting but spoke to Favorov shortly after it occurred, says he memorialized Favorov’s account in a document he sent to State Department officials.
According to Perry, Parnas also told Favorov that Yovanovitch, the US ambassador to Ukraine, would be fired within months. Yovanovitch was a vocal supporter of Kobolyev due to his reputation for opposing corruption; her removal could have cleared a significant road block in the campaign to oust Kobolyev. Yovanovitch had also backed Kobolyev in a dispute pitting Naftogaz against Firtash, in which Kobolyev claimed Firtash’s firms had illegally pocketed up to $2 billion since 2017 by stiffing the state-owned company on payments.
Parnas and Fruman “couldn’t get rid of Kobolyev because of the strong support that he enjoyed from the ambassador,” explains Perry. “So they [thought], We need to get the ambassador removed.”
Around that time, Parnas and Fruman were peddling unsubstantiated claims that Yovanovitch had privately denigrated Trump. Giuliani pushed other allegations about Yovanovitch to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. These attacks helped cause Trump to force Yovanovitch’s early removal from her post in May.
Parnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles Airport in Virginia on October 9. Both had one-way tickets to Vienna. Giuliani, meanwhile, revealed to reporters that he had intended to travel to Vienna the next day, sparking speculation that the travel plans of all three men were somehow related to Firtash. Giuliani told NBC News he “wasn’t planning to go see” Firtash in Vienna. John Dowd, a former lawyer for Trump who now represents Parnas and Fruman, did not respond to requests for comment.
The overlap between Parnas and Fruman’s business activities, their dirt-digging with Giuliani, and their interactions with Firtash raises questions about the true scope of the Trump-Ukraine scandal—a story that has grown far beyond the initial controversy over a phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president. Is it possible that Firtash’s case, Parnas and Fruman’s plotting, and Giuliani’s freelancing in Ukraine are intertwined? Asked by phone whether Firtash hoped to win favor with Trump and his Justice Department by helping to undermine the president’s critics, Toensing declined to comment on the record and abruptly hung up.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Now He’s Scrambling to Keep His “Mandate of Heaven.”,Marianne Szegedy-Maszak,MotherJones,Politics,"When President Donald Trump appeared on Saturday night at the Values Voters Summit in Washington, DC, he was speaking to an audience of his most loyal supporters. But for the first time in his administration, he had done something that had awakened the long slumbering consciences of prominent evangelical leaders and their flocks. The week before the annual confab of conservative Christians, Trump impulsively decided to abandon the Kurds in Syria, and by the time the faithful had gathered at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, the Turks had already invaded and embarked on the slaughter of our one-time allies.
Throughout his tenure, white, evangelical Protestants have stood firm with the president; he secured 80 percent of their vote in 2016, and their approval of his presidency has hovered between 69 and 78 percent according to the Pew Research Center. In this relationship, the quid pro quo has been pretty obvious: They vote for him and ignore scandals about hush money for porn stars and children in cages. In return, he gives them conservative judges (and not just on the Supreme Court), an assault on abortion rights, jobs for many of their own in key government positions, a move of the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and clarion calls to safeguard a selective and weaponized idea of religious freedom whenever he can—even at the UN.
The first signs of evangelical distress began with 89-year-old Pat Robertson, the Southern Baptist minister, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, and evangelical superstar, who appeared on his syndicated program, the 700 Club, the morning after Trump’s announcement. He said he was “appalled” by the decision, concluding “I believe…the president of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of Heaven if he permits this to happen.”
Soon after Robertson’s admonition, and condemnations from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Trump acolyte and golfing partner Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the hallelujah chorus of others chimed in. Rev. Franklin Graham, who has been one of the most crawlingly obsequious of Trump’s ministers and had embarked on a thinly disguised political tour dubbed “Decision America” to further solidify support of the president, took to Twitter a few days later:

The backlash has led to a series of quiet moves by the Trump administration to mollify the religious right, reversing the usual dynamic between the two groups. Instead of Christians being put in the position of rationalizing Trump’s behavior, here was an instance of the Trump White House arraying itself in godliness to stay in their good graces.
So what happened? Why would the fate of a beleaguered minority thousands of miles away embolden right wing evangelicals in a way that the president’s innumerable other transgressions haven’t?
One reason could be found praying over President Trump at the Values Voters meeting on Saturday night. Rev. Andrew Brunson was pastor with the Izmir Resurrection Church in Turkey and has been a cause célèbre for the religious right ever since he was arrested in October 2016 and told that his missionary work was a violation of Turkish national security. He was accused of being a spy for the ethnic Kurds, tried, and initially sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The evangelical community was outraged. One of its own had been persecuted for his religion by Muslims and turned into a geopolitical pawn. After he became president, Trump, with an able assist from his evangelical vice president Mike Pence pushed for Brunson’s release and, eventually, after White House pressure, Brunson was moved out of prison to house arrest. In 2018, Brunson was resentenced to three years in prison, which amounted to time served.
The pastor’s first stop upon his return to the United States was a visit with President Trump, with whom he prayed in the White House. Southern Baptist minister Robert Jeffress—who recently appeared on a Sunday edition of Fox & Friends warning of “a Civil War–like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal” should the impeachment inquiry be successful—praised the president’s accomplishment: “I join all Americans in sincere thanks to President Donald J. Trump and his administration for their relentless dedication to religious freedom and tough negotiations with Turkey to secure Pastor Brunson’s release today. Yet another example of ‘promise made, promise kept’ by the Trump administration. Praise God!”
But now the promise that was made became the promise that was broken. Certainly, Brunson’s ordeal illustrated that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was no friend of evangelical Christians. At the same time, there are many Christians among the vulnerable Kurdish communities in Syria.
There is another factor at work though, one that is perhaps more difficult for non-evangelicals to fully appreciate. I reached out to an evangelical minister friend of mine and asked what he made of the unexpected criticisms from these leaders. “I think it gets to a loyalty and betrayal factor,” he texted. “The celebrity/large cash generating, influential, affinity organizational types place a real premium on loyalty—and often severely punish disloyalty.” He explained that this occurs within their organizations—not surprising given their authoritarian set up—and has been essential to maintaining their success and prosperity. Indeed it explains their previously unquestioning loyalty to Trump, “because he has delivered on his promises to us: on abortion, pounding on the evil secular, anti-Christian media, elevating our own to cabinet posts.”
But when it comes to the Kurds, “they are known to have helped us win the war in Iraq and succeed in vanquishing ISIS in Syria,” he continued, “so people like Robertson would hold that they deserve our undying loyalty.” An unusual interplay was catalyzed in which Trump sided with Erdoğan, a persecutor of Christians, against the Kurds. He had convinced some of the evangelical leaders that the unsavory world leaders whom Trump has embraced—Putin and Kim most obviously—weren’t really so bad. But Erdoğan was different.
So Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were deployed to Turkey to try and fix a mess that had clearly gotten out of hand. Again, the choice of these two to carry out the work was intended for both foreign and domestic consumption. They were the highest–ranking members of the administration, so they demonstrated respect to the Turkish president and a capacity to make a deal. At the same time, they are two of the truest believers, themselves prominent evangelical Christians, whose presence was another reminder that the religious right was in good hands with the Trump administration.
There were other reminders too. The homepage of the State Department website, for instance, when the Values Voters were gathering in DC, highlighted Pompeo’s speech to the American Association of Christian Counselors in Nashville, Tennessee. The title? “Being a Christian Leader.”
The same day, Attorney General William Barr stepped up and delivered his own jeremiad at the University of Notre Dame on the subject of religious liberty—a favorite of the Trump administration. He railed against “militant secularists”  who “are not content to leave religious people alone to practice their faith. Instead, they seem to take a delight in compelling people to violate their conscience.” He then spiraled into a passionate critique of secular society, ticking off its “moral chaos” and “irresponsible personal conduct” as well as “licentiousness—the unbridled pursuit of personal appetites at the expense of the common good.” The moral of his story? “Religion helps teach, train, and habituate people to want what is good.”
On October 27, the chaos following the Trump administration’s abandonment of the Kurds will be the subject of a “night of prayer” organized by Frontier Alliance International, a Christian international medical aid organization. “The event will neither be a condemnation nor a defense of President Trump or his Middle East policies,” the organizers write. “We are asking participants to leave partisan politics in the parking lot. We are gathering as Christians to consider and pray about issues that are much larger in scope than the decisions of a sitting President or the evolving dynamics of isolated geopolitical events. We aim to present the big picture, pray how the Lord would have us respond, and catalyze a Kurdish solidarity movement in the United States with the intention of also provoking the international community to do the same.” It will be held at the Trump Hotel in Washington.

https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/chicago-teachers-are-on-strike-for-their-city/,2019-10-18,,,politics,"October 18, 2019",Chicago Teachers Are on Strike for Their City,Edwin Rios,MotherJones,Politics,"On Thursday, after months of negotiations, tens of thousands of Chicago teachers stepped away from the classroom to strike on behalf of what the city’s schools CEO, Janice Jackson, calls a “social justice bargaining” agenda. She used the phrase sneeringly, but what was there to sneer at? In addition to the standard suite of educator demands—pay raises, a reduction in class sizes, more social workers and nurses—the Chicago Teachers Union is calling on the city to increase funding for affordable housing, hire staff to help homeless students, and expand community schools that offer “wraparound” services for students. Educators are asking Chicago to address the gaps in social provision they’re too often called upon to fill themselves.
These are a unique set of demands, from a union that played an outsized role in re-energizing the labor movement and raising worker expectations around the country. Going up against then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel during their 2012 strike, Chicago teachers likewise went beyond simple bread-and-butter issues like pay and made demands for broader social change, framing the issue as one of racial equity. This is known as “bargaining for the public good,” and teacher unions are increasingly adopting the approach. Earlier this year, in Los Angeles, teachers parlayed a walkout during contract negotiations into more funding for nurses and social workers, reduced class sizes, and even limits to police searches.
Ahead of Thursday’s strike, I spoke to Stacy Davis Gates, vice president of the Chicago Teachers Union, to talk about the teachers’ return to the picket line and the meaning of bargaining for the public good.
What’s the current status of negotiations?
There’s a bit of resignation on the other side of the table. But also, the other side of the table doesn’t understand how to do equity and justice with respect to a collective bargaining agreement, because the Chicago Public Schools have a long history of inequity and injustice. And so what we are asking them to do in this moment is something that they don’t have much of a muscle for.
What are the core differences between the two sides?
The Chicago Teachers Union sees this collective bargaining agreement as something that helps to reposition and transform our school districts. Chicago Public Schools sees this as a power move. And not understanding the function of school—and what those workers who are in the schools are asking for—is a fundamental difference in our positions and is why we’re so far apart.
Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson called CTU’s approach “social justice bargaining.” How do you respond to that characterization?
Look, I don’t know any teacher who made a choice to teach in the Chicago Public Schools who does not see their role as a change agent. You don’t teach in Englewood, Roseland, or West Garfield Park to maintain status quo. You teach there because you want children in those environments to understand potential, to understand their ability to shift potential in that space and to be better as people. So I don’t understand what she doesn’t understand.
In that sense, as you guys are fighting for more than just pay and benefits, going beyond the mandatory parts of this bargaining…
We don’t become teachers because we’re trying to get rich. Wall Street, LaSalle Street, those are places for people who are driven by money.
Our members are driven by service to children in the city, and in order to do the services for the children in the city, their families, and the communities that they inhabit, you need resources and you need staff in order to do it, or else you’re just maintaining status quo. It is the worst thing in the world as an educator to go home every single night and feel like you failed the students in front of you. It is terrible. And because it feels like that, you have people who have now found their power and their voice and are pushing for something better. It is not fair for us to go into school communities and to manage poverty. It is not fair for our teachers to go into these school communities and manage the lack of resources and to manage white supremacy and to manage low expectations.
Our children are put in a position where they have to adjust to everything bad in this world. That’s unfair. What the educators in the Chicago Teachers Union are saying in this moment is that the adjusting needs to happen with the people who do not pay taxes. So in Chicago, we subsidize building the skyscrapers, we subsidize wealthy playgrounds in one of the richest neighborhoods in the world. But we don’t subsidize social workers and nurses for students in Austin. We don’t subsidize smaller class sizes for students in Chatham. What we do is that these things are exacerbated by the inequities that have been built into the system. And so you’re expecting a teacher to give and to do, but you give them nothing to do it with. That is unjust.
Chicago is a very expensive place, and it’s getting more and more expensive as the days go on. Chicago is also a place that evicted black people from its premises. They tore down public housing, and with the destruction of public housing, black people were pushed out of the city. And it contributes to the number of students who are homeless in this city. That’s a problem. How do you have children who don’t have homes that are before you on a daily basis and you don’t say something about it? But I gotta be honest with you. I don’t understand why this is such a big deal for other people to conceive of. Have you ever been in a classroom where you can ask, “Has anyone been impacted by gun violence?” and see the majority of hands go up in your classroom? Have you ever been in a classroom where you ask people if they live with your mom and dad and you don’t see a lot of hands go up that they live with an aunt, they live with the uncle, or they live with the godmother?
We are actually dealing with children who are living a very precarious existence because there is nothing here for them. Rahm closed mental health care clinics. He was a part of the destruction of public housing. He sat on Chicago Housing Authority money while the wait list for Section 8 continued to build out of this world. We live in a city where they closed 50 schools on black children and privatized a tremendous amount of others and those schools do not meet the needs of all students that attend it. Look, we are dealing with the impact of terrible social policy in this city, and it is unbelievable to me that people think we shouldn’t have a voice on that. We are responsible for that anytime you say that a kid has to take a test and the score on that test determines if I’m a good teacher or if I’m a bad teacher. And I know, number one, that the instruments you’re giving them is grounded in white supremacy and racism. Number two, if I don’t have a stable household, if my father doesn’t have a stable employment, that those test scores are not going to reach the level the district says they have to reach. So I’m dealing with all of these mandates by the district but have no resources from the district or the city that’s in control of the district. That’s the problem.
Why is it important to talk about education in harmony with other issues like support staff and affordable housing?
Because in school districts where achievement is the norm, students have stable household environments. They have parents who are not incarcerated. They have neighborhoods that are not besieged by gun violence, right? Those things are important. Stability is important. Safety is important. Employment is important. Housing is important. Those things contribute to academic achievement. And so if you’re not building school policy that looks like that, that supports that, you’re in trouble. We’re under mayoral control. So our boss is actually in control of everything in this city. Why would we ask our boss who is in control of housing, who is in control of employment, who is in control of development, who is in control of public safety, to also not be in control of giving those things to the spaces in the city that have been neglected for generations? It makes sense to me.
What do you make of Mayor Lightfoot saying that it’s not appropriate to talk about affordable housing?
Well, if it was already here and she had done her job, then we wouldn’t have to talk about it. So the ball is in her court. If she doesn’t want us to talk about it, then deal with it.
What does a win look like as you push for affordable housing?
You can look at this in two ways. Everyone in our union is not a teacher. We have teachers’ assistants. We have school clerks, support personnel. Two-thirds of our support personnel, their children qualify for free and reduced lunch. So we want those women, because it’s largely women, largely women of color, we want them to be able to afford to live in the city of Chicago. And so we want what they give to police officers and firemen in the city to make vying in this city affordable. That’s number one. Number two, we want our families connected to the city services that offer relief when you are homeless, when you are housing insecure. We want to have a point person [for the members of] the school community who are suffering through unaffordability and homelessness the most. We want a person there able to connect those families to the services that are in the city to make sure that people who are being impacted by that trauma are getting help. It’s not a huge ask. It just really isn’t.
Mayor Lightfoot has said it’s too expensive to respond to all those demands. How do you respond to that?
That’s dumb. That’s how I respond to it. Again, this city has subsidized the construction of skyscrapers. Taxpayers in the city of Chicago have paid for skyscrapers that 99 percent of them have never been in. The city of Chicago is literally building a playground for wealthy people in Lincoln Park to have a good time, and students do not have homes. That is a question of morality.
How does this moment compare to 2012 when the teachers went on strike?
Look, it’s not a moment. It’s a movement. We believe that this work is a part of a movement. Moments are fleeting. Movements are sustaining. They involve more than a union. They involve community. They involve children, they involve parents and families. We don’t see this in comparison. We see this as an extension, as an expansion of the work we’ve been putting forth for the last decade.
As a mother of three kids in Chicago’s schools, how do you see that influence your approach to fighting for a contract?
I became a high school English teacher in Englewood, in Humboldt Park, in North Lawndale because children in places that have been forgotten about by city leadership for generations, those children need to know that they have value, that they matter. And my fight for my children isn’t any different from any other child in the city because my children will have to live in this city with other people. That’s why I fight so hard. If I want my children to have a well-resourced school, I want someone else’s child to have a well-resourced school. If I want my child to have a librarian, I’m going to fight for the next child to have a librarian. My children cannot live in this world by themselves. They live in this world with other people, and I want those other people to be loved. I want those other people to have had resources and to be able to interact with my children in productive, safe ways. That’s it, man. We live in a society. We don’t live on island. We don’t live in isolation. We live in neighborhoods with people. Those people need things. And in this city, we have forgotten that.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z
https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/heres-how-mitch-mcconnell-could-sabotage-an-impeachment-trial/,2019-10-18,,,politics,"October 18, 2019",Here’s How Mitch McConnell Could Sabotage an Impeachment Trial,David Corn,MotherJones,Impeachment,"At a lunchtime gathering of Senate Republicans on Wednesday, Mitch McConnell had some news to share about impeachment: Should the House Democrats vote to impeach Donald Trump by Thanksgiving—which appears to be House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s preferred though perhaps hard-to-meet schedule—the Senate could start and quickly conduct the trial of Trump and wrap it up by Christmas. That, too, might seem an overly ambitious timeline. Action in Congress rarely occurs speedily. But one X-factor in the impeachment process—which so far has received little attention—is that Senate rules afford McConnell and the Republicans plenty of opportunity to derail an impeachment trial and turn the proceedings into a sham.
When House Democrats began raising the volume on impeachment talk earlier this year—especially after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which detailed various alleged obstructions of justice committed by Trump—an idea was kicked around by pundits and commentators: What if the House approved articles of impeachment and McConnell refused to hold a trial? Two weeks ago, though, McConnell publicly noted that in the event of a House impeachment, Senate rules would compel the upper body of Congress to stick to the Constitution and put Trump on trial. But what sort of a trial might that be, if the Republican Senate majority did not truly want to mount one? Last time Congress went through an impeachment, both chambers were controlled by the same party. After House Republicans in 1998 enthusiastically approved two articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of lying to a grand jury and obstructing justice in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The matter was sent to the Senate, which was also in the hands of Republicans, most of whom supported the impeachment (and conviction) of Clinton.
This time, House Dems will be delivering articles of impeachment to a Senate controlled by a party loyal to Trump and hostile to the prospect of booting him out of office. So how committed will McConnell and his comrades be to staging a thorough and fair proceeding? Could they rig it in Trump’s favor? Given the Senate rules, they could try.
Any impeachment trial is governed by the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials, which was last revised in 1986. These rules dictate the ins and outs of a trial to a great degree of specificity. They note that as soon as House impeachment articles are “presented to the Senate, the Senate shall, at 1 o’clock [on the] afternoon of the day (Sunday excepted) following such presentation, or sooner if ordered, by the Senate, proceed to the consideration of such articles.” The rules cite the precise proclamation the Sergeant at Arms must make once House manager of the impeachment appear in the Senate to present the articles of impeachment. They note how the chief justice of the Supreme Court must be told that he or she is to preside over a presidential impeachment and how an impeached official must be notified of his or her impeachment. (One method: leave “such copy at the last known place of abode of such person.”) And so on.
These rules do include provisions that could be abused by a party that controls the Senate to jigger the proceedings. During a trial, they say, the Senate can “make all lawful orders, rules, and regulations which it may deem essential or conducive to the ends of justice.” This reads like a blank check for mischief. A Senate majority possibly could vote to limit testimony or witnesses. Perhaps it could impose a time limit on the proceedings that would prevent a full airing of the case against Trump.
But isn’t the chief justice in charge? (Put aside the question of his possible bias for a moment.) The rules say he is, but on some matters he can be trumped by the party in control. They state that the chief justice “may rule on all questions of evidence including, but not limited to questions of relevancy, materiality, and redundancy of evidence and incidental questions, which ruling shall stand as the judgment of the Senate, unless some Member of the Senate shall ask that a formal vote be taken thereon, in which case it shall be submitted to the Senate for decision without debate.” (Emphasis added.) So if there is a debate over the introduction of a certain piece of evidence—say, Trump’s legal team raises an objection—the chief justice decides. Unless the Senate Republicans vote to overturn his ruling. The final say will go to the GOP.
The rules also allow the Republicans to keep much of the proceedings out of the public eye. Either the chief justice or a majority of the Senate can order that a committee of senators be established to “receive evidence and take testimony at such times and places as the committee may determine.” That can be done behind closed doors—though such a committee must subsequently provide the full Senate “a certified copy of the transcript of the proceedings and testimony.” The rules note that nothing prevents the Senate from “having the entire trial in open Senate.” But clearly a majority of Republicans could vote to conduct the trial in secrecy. (Most of the Clinton impeachment trial was public, but deliberations over the calling of witnesses and depositions taken of key witnesses were conducted privately. A bipartisan majority of senators voted to use excerpts from the videoed depositions instead of live witness testimony.)
The rules also note that the deliberations of the senators—the debate over whether Trump should be convicted or not—could also be kept from the public. The Senate has the right to “direct the doors to be closed while deliberating upon its decisions.”
At the GOP luncheon, McConnell told his Republican colleagues that a motion to dismiss the charges in a Trump impeachment trial—an idea floated by some Trump defenders as a way to short-circuit and quickly end the proceedings—would be determined by Chief Justice John Roberts. But the rules provide McConnell and his Republican majority latitude in other ways.
An impeachment trial is not straightforward business. The rules are not as well-established as those that cover federal trials. Important procedural questions can be presented to the chief justice. But the Senate rules essentially give the Senate the ability to reject key rulings of the presiding judge. McConnell is renowned for his wily mastering of Senate rules—and for his willingness to bust norms for political gain. (See Merrick Garland.) Though he has recognized the duty of the Senate to address—and not ignore—articles of impeachment, he may well have a trick or two in mind about how to conduct the trial—especially if he is bent on disposing of this controversy in a fast manner during holiday season.

At the beginning of harvest, vines heavy with inky clumps of grapes stretch out in perfect rows, their leaves showing the faintest yellow tinge of autumn’s impending turn. The grapevines run for 110 acres to the base of the Mayacamas and Vaca Mountains, interrupted only by the occasional service road and a quaint white farmhouse.
But picturesque landscapes are not what Dan Petroski, Larkmead’s winemaker, wants to show me when I arrive at the 124-year-old vineyard at the end of August. Instead, he trots me over to an empty field. “This is our future,” Petroski declares, spreading his arms proudly in the direction of the ruddy expanse of gravely, clay-based soil. “This is three acres we are committing to the next 21 years to figure out what’s going to be the next great wine grape of Larkmead—and hopefully of Napa Valley.”
Follow Kara to Napa and hear more about why wine matters in the conversation about climate change on our latest episode of Eating in Climate Chaos, from Bite podcast:
Right now, the distinction belongs to the cabernet sauvignon grape, which accounts for more than 80 percent of Larkmead’s annual harvest and produces the type of cabernet wines that have defined Napa for decades. A wine made with Napa cabernet sauvignon grapes, picked at the height of ripeness, will be intensely flavored with ripe plum, black currant, and floral notes. But as the valley sees warmer nights, less fog, and more days that surpass 100 degrees, Petroski and his fellow Cabernet producers are struggling to ripen their grapes as they lose the conditions that once gave their wines a flavorful edge. As the planet trends warmer, a number of researchers predict that, at some point in the next two to three decades, cabernet will stop thriving in Napa.
Wine grapes grow only under very specific conditions: the narrow bands of 30 to 50 degrees of latitude in each hemisphere, where the average temperature during the hottest months hovers in the mid-60s and just south of freezing during the coldest. Their sensitivity makes them a bellwether for climactic shifts, sounding the alarm for agricultural production more broadly.
Mother Jones first wrote about the wine industry’s fate at the hands of climate change in 2010, back when grape growers were merely speculating what a warming planet might do to their fragile product. “We have no idea what effects global warming will have on the conditions that affect Napa Valley wines, so to prepare for those changes seems to me to be whistling past the cemetery,” John Williams, co-founder of Napa’s Frog’s Leap Winery, said at the time.
Now, Petroski and his fellow winemakers do have an idea of what those effects will be, and he and others are pouring tens of thousands of dollars in experiments that may help them adapt. They believe that Napa, with the success and wealth of its wine businesses, may be in the best position to develop the creative solutions that help farmers prosper in the new normal. Starting next year, Petroski will embark on a 21-year experiment to determine which grape varieties might thrive in Napa’s warming climate. “With this climate—which has been a utopia for growing great wine grapes for the last 50 years—will it be the same grapes we’ve had success with in the last 50 years?” Petroski wonders. “Or is there going to be a whole new set of grapes that we have to evolve to?”
Napa Valley’s metamorphosis from hinterland to a dominion of fine wines is a thing of legend. In 1966, Robert Mondavi opened the first major post-Prohibition winery in Napa with a grand ambition: To turn a region known primarily for its low-quality bulk and sacramental wines into a mecca for the most highly sought vintages in the world. The region’s hot days, cool nights, and low rainfall bore uncanny similarities to the dry Mediterranean climate of Bordeaux, France, which had for centuries produced the world’s most celebrated wines. A flock of like-minded disciples followed Mondavi’s lead, planting grapes that defined Bordeaux’s blends—most significantly, cabernet sauvignon. By the mid-1970s, Mondavi and his allies had succeeded: A blind tasting held in Paris in 1976 declared Napa’s Bordeaux-style wines to be better than their forbearers’. Today, cabernet vines cover 51 percent of Napa’s 46,000 acres, and the 2018 crop reached $1 billion in value.
For more than half a century, vintners specializing in Cabernet have enjoyed near-perfect growing conditions in Napa. The region’s summer days begin with a layer of fog—something winemakers call “refrigerated sunshine”—that burns off by midday, providing just the right amount of heat required to develop sugars in the grapes that give wine its sweetness and alcohol. Cool nights follow with a temperature shift of nearly 50 degrees on average, which builds the fruit’s acidity, a necessary counter to the sugar. The grapes generally hang on the vine until late October, giving them enough time to develop a complex tannic structure—the compound that gives wine that drying mouthfeel red-wine drinkers have been conditioned to crave.
But not this year. Petroski and I walk over to nearby cabernet sauvignon vines and taste a couple of grapes. They’re nearly fully baked, Petroski says; he’ll pick his first red wine grapes just after Labor Day. “It’s August,” he says. “This is the right time to be picking sauvignon blanc, but red wine grapes—you wouldn’t normally expect to pick them this early.” The evenings haven’t been getting as cool as they used to, meaning there isn’t as much morning fog. On average, Petroski’s picking red wine grapes four weeks earlier than he had been when he first started making wines for Larkmead in 2006. In some years, he’s picked them at the end of August, two months earlier than their expected date of ripeness.
Early isn’t a major problem for now. Petroski cloaks 90 percent of the grapes with shade cloth to help regulate the early morning temperatures. But he’s imagining a not-so-distant future when the evenings never get cool, or the shade cloth doesn’t help. Based on current historical averages, Napa only sees two days a year with a heat index above 100 degrees. By 2050, the region can expect to see between 15 and 30 days above 100 degrees, according to a July report from the Union of Concerned Scientists. At that temperature, grapevines generally stop production: They’ll halt the process of turning sunlight into energy, stunting the growth of the plant and the fruit. If the hot temperatures sustain, vines lose their leaves.
As for the grapes? “Raisins,” Petroski says, a kind of stewy, sugary mess that more closely resembles jam than wine. If Napa’s temperatures continue to climb, he imagines cabernet will turn into an “out-of-balance, no-flavor, kind of insipid grape that looks great but tastes terrible.”
Next year, Petroski plans to test out seven grape varieties that he doesn’t currently grow on the Larkmead property. He’ll try a few grapes known to thrive in hotter Mediterranean climates, like touriga nacional, the Portuguese grape at the heart of port, and tempranillo, which is the base of Spanish Rioja. He’ll also plant some zinfandel and petite syrah, varieties that do well in California’s Central Valley, a bit south of Napa.
“What we’re hearing and what science is telling us is that the entire coast of the United States is going to shift its weather pattern by 120 miles north in 20 to 30 years,” Petroski says. “So if we have to think of what’s a hundred miles south of us and they’re growing Zinfandel and Petite Syrah and are doing well with it—that’s going to be our climate in 20 years. We need to be thinking about that here.”
Other growers in Napa have been thinking about this, too, as the San Francisco Chronicle’s Esther Mobley has reported. Spottswoode Winery, another family-owned producer five miles southeast of Larkmead, is similarly testing out other varieties. Andy Beckstoffer, one of Napa’s most renowned cabernet grape growers, is working with the University of California, Davis, to develop 100 different combinations of grape plant clones and rootstock to find one that is drought-tolerant and has a longer ripening cycle that will counteract the natural proclivities of the current plants vintners favor. There’s some urgency in figuring out which grape merits the investment: A 2011 study found that the amount of land in Northern California suitable for growing wine grapes could decrease by half by the year 2040 due to climate change; around the world, the amount of suitable land will shrink by 23 to 75 percent by 2050.
In a world in which half a billion people live in places rapidly turning to deserts, and increasing droughts, floods, and storms further threaten the 10 percent of the world’s undernourished population, caring about the future of wine may seem a bit frivolous. Watching wealthy diners waste $10,000 on a bottle of wine, in fact, is what pushed Corbin Trent, an activist who helped bring Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez into office and serves as her campaign’s communications director, to leave his job as a chef and move into politics, where he could correct the economic forces that enabled such behavior, the Intercept’s Ryan Grim detailed in his new book. Wine is but a tiny percentage of the world’s agricultural production, and Napa is but a drop in that very small bottle: Only 0.4 percent of the world’s wine comes from the valley.
Elizabeth Wolkovich, an associate professor of forest and conservation sciences at the University of British Columbia, used to have similar misgivings. “Climate change is such a major issue—we should be talking about people who experience food insecurity and the foundational issues of getting by,” she says. “And yet, people were much more interested in talking to me about what was happening to their Bordeaux.”
But over time, her thinking has changed: Now, she welcomes people drawing connections between the food they’re enjoying and changes on a grander scale. “Anything that engages people is a great way to talk about climate change,” she says. “We all have to start the conversation somewhere and wine is a great place to start.”
As for Petroski, he has started viewing the luxury product as an opportunity. His wine’s financial success has given him and his fellow vintners the ability to refine their agricultural practices—something that could, in turn, benefit agriculture as a whole as it strives to adapt to a new climate. In many respects, Petroski has inherited Mondavi’s ambition, but with a new goal in mind. “Because of the success we’ve had with our travel and our tourism and hospitality, there’s money in this valley to invest in being leaders,” Petroski says. “If we truly believe the statement that wine is made in a vineyard, then we should be the best vineyard farmers in the world.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But Really Not Many.",Stephanie Mencimer,MotherJones,Politics,"On Thursday, impeachment foes converged on Washington for the first big pro-Trump rally in the city since shortly after Donald Trump was elected president. According to its website, the “March for Trump: Stop Impeachment Now!” event was initiated by people who “want our President to know he is not alone and we stand with him.”
Judging by the crowd size—only a few hundred protesters were there—not all that many people seemed willing to take the day off to stand with Trump against impeachment. But that might have been as much a function of last minute transportation snafus as the country’s support for the president. Nonetheless, the true believers marched down Pennsylvania Avenue for a rally on the Capitol lawn. They had come from as far away as Arkansas, Florida, and Connecticut to participate. Armed with plenty of Trump 2020 banners and “Stop the Coup” signs, they chanted “Drain the swamp!” as they walked.
The marchers finally assembled on the west lawn of the Capitol where they’d been promised speeches from members of Congress. But the lawmakers were slow to materialize, so the audience had to make do with former Navy Seal Jonathan Gilliam, author of the personal safety book Sheep No More and an occasional Fox News guest, and Jack Posobiec, an internet troll and One America News host who helped spread the Pizzagate conspiracy theory.
Posobiec spent some of his allotted time consoling the marchers who may have lost friends because of their Trump support. “I’m sure everyone in this crowd who’s wearing one of these MAGA hats, are wearing a Trump hat, has got someone in their lives, someone in their family, that’s just so nasty to them because of who you support in politics,” he said, lamenting that people just can’t get along the way Roseanne and her liberal sister do on the sitcom.
Eventually, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), Rep. John Rutherford (R-Fla.), and Rep. Doug Collins (R-Georgia) showed up to rail against their Democratic colleagues investigating Trump and rally the crowd to stand tall with the president. Collins told the crowd that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was trying to “overthrow the votes” of Trump supporters with the impeachment inquiry, while Scalise branded the proceedings a “kangaroo court.”
If the event had the feel of a reconstituted tea party rally, it might be because the march was sponsored by Women for American First, a nonprofit 501(c)4 organization headed up by former tea party activist Amy Kremer. That grassroots conservative movement emerged in 2009 after the election of Barack Obama to oppose his administration and some of its signature policies, such as the Affordable Care Act. The movement helped elect some of the most extreme members of Congress—remember Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.)?—and forced out moderate Republicans including former House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio).
A former Delta flight attendant who calls herself one of the “founding mothers” of the tea party movement, Kremer was the longtime chief executive of the Tea Party Express, which organized bus tours across the country and worked on a variety of campaigns in 2010 and 2012 to help Republicans retake Congress. One of the best known tea party groups, the Tea Party Express was also well known for being run by a political action committee that raised tons of money from small donors and spent most of it on the political consultants who started the PAC rather than on candidates.
Kremer was an early Trump supporter during the 2016 presidential campaign when she started a political action committee called TrumPAC to raise money to support his insurgent campaign. The PAC, one of several that sprang up to fundraise off the Trump candidacy, ran afoul of campaign finance rules for using the name of a candidate without permission. It was later rebranded the Great America PAC. She left the Great America PAC after a falling out with its leadership and went on to join with the ex-wife of indicted Trump adviser Roger Stone to launch another pro-Trump super PAC, Women Vote Trump, that pledged to raise $30 million to support Trump’s campaign for president.
As CNN reported, the group came up $29,973,187 short of that goal, went into debt, and got in trouble with the FEC for the unauthorized use of a candidate’s name. The PAC changed the name to Women Vote Smart, but it continued to organize events under the banner of Women for Trump. In October 2018, the group hosted a “Women for America First Summit”—slogan “Heels on, gloves off!”—at the Trump International Hotel in DC, featuring a “deep state cocktail reception,” and the president’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump. Over the summer, Kremer and her daughter Kylie started a new nonprofit, Women for America First, which can raise unlimited money to rally support for the president without disclosing its donors. That’s the organization behind Thursday’s rally. A spokesman for the group did not respond to questions about the its donors or who was paying for anti-impeachment march.
I stopped to talk with two women who explained what brought them to the event, and what they believe Trump has done for women.

As with the old tea party events, the pro-Trump marchers were overwhelmingly white, older and, of course, Republican. Likewise, the event featured a solid contingent of supporters of the late convicted fraudster and cult leader Lyndon Larouche, anti-abortion activists, Second Amendment enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists. I listened to one man try to explain to a heckler that the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry was simply a “smokescreen” designed to cover up their efforts to sabotage Trump’s 2016 presidential election. When the heckler asked the man to detail exactly how that all went down, he mumbled something about Ukraine, “the server,” and Democrats, and then gave up.  “Barr knows,” he concluded ominously. He was referring to Trump’s attorney general William Barr, who has been traveling abroad to solicit help from foreign intelligence agencies in a campaign to discredit the investigation into Trump’s involvement with Russia during the 2016 election.
The rally may have invoked some of the tea party’s characters and approaches, but the event often seemed more like a parallel universe. The March for Trump took place while an extraordinary stream of chaotic news from the White House, all mostly bad for the president, unfolded. After the rally, the Trump supporters spent the day visiting members of Congress to oppose impeachment. While they were on the Hill, the president’s chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, held a press conference in which he confirmed that the president had indeed withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure its president to investigate the son of Trump’s potential 2020 opponent, former vice president Joe Biden. Trump himself has previously admitted that he solicited help from a foreign government for his 2020 reelection campaign. But marchers at the Capitol were having none of that.
Donna Gathright had come with her daughter from Lebanon, Pennsylvania, to support Trump, and she said she refused to believe that he would ask a foreign country to meddle in the election. “That isn’t anything he would do. He loves this country,” she said. When I told her that Trump had admitted on TV that he’d done just that, she responded, “They lied on TV!” She said it was just fake news, just like the coverage of Trump’s comments after the deadly neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville in 2017, when he said the white supremacists included some “very fine people.”
“He didn’t say that in Charlottesville either,” Gathright insisted.
Her sentiments were echoed by Mary Simmons, another marcher from Arkansas who chimed in that Trump’s attacks on the media are one reason that she likes him so much. “He gives us the warnings about fake news,” she explained. “Be aware, keep your eyes open, and you can’t believe everything you see.” Both women seemed to believe that TV video is regularly doctored to make Trump look bad.
Gathright also claimed that it was not Trump but President Barack Obama who had enriched himself from the presidency. Simmons concurred, adding with a whisper that Obama had sent money into secret Swiss bank accounts. They love that Trump refuses to take a government salary as president, a sign of his benevolence stemming from the fact that he had already made his fortune before getting elected. A few hours after they were lauding Trump’s refusal to cash in on the presidency, Mulvaney announced that Trump had decided to host the G-7 gathering of world leaders next year at the resort he owns in Miami, the Trump Doral.
No one referred to the mass of criticism leveled at the administration by both parties for its abandonment of the Kurds in Turkey and Trump’s apparent endorsement of ethnic cleansing in Syria. For those who attended the march, the president was a hero, beloved by all and singlehandedly responsible for a booming economy, energy independence, and building the wall. “If those Democrats get power, look out,” Gathright warned. “They’re evil. Let the guy work. He’s doing great things.”
There were a few problems, however, with the march. As with the old tea party events, organizers had arranged for buses to bring in Trump supporters from around the country. But on Wednesday night, the buses were cancelled and organizers said many potential marchers were stranded in Boston and elsewhere—a possible explanation for the poor turnout. Trump supporters immediately saw a conspiracy at work, a theory promoted by Posobiec, who mentioned the transportation crisis during his speech at the rally. “I hear there was a bus issue today,” Posobiec said. “The company refused to work with folks.” Kremer acknowledged the bus problem and blamed the company in a Facebook post, saying, “We feel this was done intentionally.”
Kremer later released a statement saying, “Last night, less than two hours before our first chartered buses were supposed to leave for DC, we were informed that the bus company was cancelling all of our buses—including ones that were fully paid for. This move left hundreds of grassroots activists stranded and unable to attend the Anti-Impeachment rally today in front of the Capitol. We are incredibly disappointed at US Coachways, their actions prevented hundreds of Americans from exercising their first amendment rights and to have their voices heard.”
But according to Joseph Heap, the CMO of US Coachways, politics had nothing to do with the company’s decision to cancel the busses. He says that the march organizers started working with the Staten Island-based company just 10 days ago, but they refused to pay a deposit for the six buses they were trying to reserve. He said that on Wednesday, at 3 pm, just hours before one of the buses was scheduled to depart for DC, one of the organizers called to finally make a payment. The credit card was declined, he said.
It wouldn’t be the first time that one of Kremer’s political enterprises has run into financial problems. In 2017, she jumped into the Republican primary to fill the congressional seat vacated by Georgia Rep. Tom Price, who had left to become Trump’s secretary of health and human services. Two months before the special election, Kremer’s staff quit en masse, claiming that she couldn’t pay them.
Heap said the bus company tried to work with pro-Trump organizers and waited while they called the bank, but the credit card payments never went through, so they had to cancel the buses. “We didn’t care that it was a Trump rally at all. We don’t do things that way,” Heap told me. “We want the business. This is exactly what we’re in the business to do. We really did want to make it work for them. We worked with them all the way up to the very end. We really did. ”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

It also can be really good—like really good—sometimes. But for too long the genre was demeaned as exclusively “the taste of 13-year-olds.” Critics were long given license to tear into the genre and its stars. In a 2014 60 Minutes and Vanity Fair poll, they asked “Which decade had the worst music?” and an overwhelming 42 percent of respondents said it was the current decade. Pop music, according to one headline, has been “Literally Ruining Our Brains.”
Of late, that critical consensus has shifted. While pop music has always had stars both mainstream and underground defying stereotypes, only recently has the modern pop genre been dissected and intellectualized with thorough fanfare. Which is good: Because artists like L Devine deserve it.

Devine—British born Olivia Devine—represents the type of pop artist that’s shaping the future of the genre. (Which is why there’s no shortage of associations between her and the often hailed “Pop Star of the Future” Charli XCX.) Pop music has always evolved through adaptation of the underground, pop forever consuming smaller genres to then spit them out mixed with the mass-produced. Devine herself put it best in an interview with Dork, “I got into pop music, not because I listen to it more than other genres, but because pop music is the one you can bend the most.”
This attitude, that “pop music is the one you can bend the most,” is what’s flipping the age old genre stereotype that people listen to pop because it is formulaic. Artists like Charli XCX, Bree Runway, Dorian Electra, Slayyyter, Carly Rae Jepsen, and yes, Devine, know that the only way to break the rules is to know them. They make a type of meta-pop that is self aware.
From her heartbreaking track “Daughter” to the horny anthem “Naked Alone,” Devine has defined herself as a pop artist that pushes limits. “[Pop] doesn’t really have any boundaries,” she reiterated to Dork. “You can constantly reinvent what it is and what it means to you.”

Part of what defines pop music is its inability to be defined. As Stereogum’s Chris DeVille wrote in his annual State Of Pop Address, “the concept of pop music is slippery and subjective.” He echoed Jon Caramanica’s point that pop “can be a descriptor of audience size, indicating something that’s popular, or it can be a genre tag, specifying a sound.” Caramanica continued to note that the “meanings of pop have been so tightly tethered” that they are “difficult to disentangle.”
Devine’s newest single, “Peachy Keen,” asks: Why should we even try? “Peachy Keen” samples one of 1981’s biggest hits, Kim Carnes’ “Bette Davis Eyes” before launching into a mix of synthesized keys and hip hop beats. The track compresses almost 40 years of music and technological developments into a sound. All of it is pop.
Devine’s discography thrives on the mixing and matching of genres—an intertwined and tangled mess. She purposefully refashions the tropes. There’s the sampling of one of pop culture’s favorite references, 1988’s Heathers in “Peer Pressure.” Her track “Panic” clearly takes inspiration from her origins as a singer/songwriter (and yes, punk). (Plus, she does it all while being unapologetically queer.)
Pop music has always been about being unapologetic—about doing the most and being the most. (Which is maybe why so many dislike it.) It’s an essentially queer genre of music—from yesteryear’s Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday to today’s megastars like Elton John and Lady Gaga. Devine’s blatant and casual inclusion of her queer identity further expands pop music’s fearless defiance.
As streaming continues to redefine pop music, weirder sub-genres will emerge to chase listens. (Whisper-pop anyone?) But an algorithm is still a formula. L Devine’s experimentation isn’t a quest to be part of the newest fad. Instead, with each new release, Devine proves that as much as we want to define pop, the magnetism of the genre is just how much you can do with it.

Politically, it’s also the best thing to do. Republicans want a fast impeachment so they can brush it off as a partisan stunt and get on with business. Democrats should want just the opposite. They need to treat it seriously, and they need time to build up public support as new revelations are unearthed. Until we get to the point where a third or so of Republicans support impeachment, there’s not much point in voting on articles in the House.

But other Republicans did acknowledge the damning nature of what Mulvaney had revealed, as Politico noted:
Today, John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, took the criticism of Trump a step further.

Even though the ads contain misinformation, a Facebook spokesperson says they did not violate their company’s advertising policy because of a carveout for politicians.
“Joe Biden PROMISED Ukraine $1 BILLION DOLLARS if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son’s company,” reads one ad the campaign started running on Wednesday, according to Facebook’s public ad archive.
“Joe Biden boasted that as vice president he threatened to withhold $1 billion in foreign aid from Ukraine unless they fired the prosecutor looking into a lucrative contract held by his son, Hunter Biden,” reads another Trump ad that began running the same day. The Trump campaign also ran ads with similar language earlier in the week which are now inactive.

The advertisements fly in the face of Facebook’s stated intent to crack down on disinformation, and would appear to violate the company’s policies “prohibit[ing] ads that include claims debunked by third-party fact checkers.” But a Facebook spokesperson told Mother Jones that because the disinformation comes directly from the Trump campaign, it is exempt from those rules as a result of other company policies that prevent it from taking action on the speech of politicians—regardless of how much or how brazenly they may lie.
According to Popular Info, the provisions that allow Trump and other politicians to lie in Facebook ads are the result of a policy change implemented last week. Facebook disputes Popular Information’s characterization, saying the changes don’t represent a shift in policy but were issued to make existing rules clearer.
The president’s campaign ads seek to further a narrative based on false assertions about the former vice president’s actions in Ukraine. While his son Hunter’s work with a Ukrainian energy company may have opened Joe Biden to charges of hypocrisy and been ethically problematic, factcheckers that Facebook has officially partnered with suggest his business dealings were legal and unrelated to the vice president’s work in making sure prosecutor Viktor Shokin was fired.
While Trump has tried to peddle a contrasting and unsubstantiated narrative that Biden tried to remove Shokin as a move to protect his son, there are at least two key details that suggest this wasn’t the case: Bloomberg News found that the investigation involving Hunter had been dormant for a year before Biden called for the Ukranian prosecutor to step down. Also, at the time there was separate international pressure for Ukraine to remove the prosecutor who was widely seen, by both foreign and local good government advocates, as broadly soft on corruption. Politifact, an official Facebook factchecking partner, has closely examined the claims and said it found no evidence to “support the idea that Joe Biden advocated with his son’s interests in mind.” Factcheck.org, another Facebook factchecking partner, came to the same conclusion.
Just last week, the company’s vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, wrote a Facebook post claiming that “when a politician shares previously debunked content including links, videos and photos, we plan to demote that content, display related information from fact-checkers, and reject its inclusion in advertisements.”
But neither Clegg’s post, nor remarks he gave in Washington, D.C. rolling out the policy, clearly noted that a politician’s own speech would be exempt from that fact-checking process and any ensuing consequences.
Facebook did briefly remove a nearly identical set of ads run by Trump campaign’s earlier in the week, however a company spokesperson explained it was because the accompanying videos included a clip of Joe Biden saying “son of a bitch,” confirming that the ads did not otherwise violate its rules again misinformation. The spokesperson clarified that the politician exemption might not apply if Trump or another candidate were to share content from a third party website that contained information flagged by one of its factchecking partners.
According to Facebook’s archive, the ads have been displayed 270,000 to 600,000 times. While the archive only provides spending ranges, the approximately $2,200 to $7,100 the campaign outlaid to boost the adds is a tiny fraction of the more than $1.5 million they’ve spent on ads on the platform just since September 24.
Earlier this week, the CEO of the Democratic National Committee, Seema Nanda, criticized Facebook for not stopping Trump from “mislead[ing] the American people on their platform unimpeded, saying the party was “deeply disappointed in Facebook’s decision to exempt statements from political candidates from its fact-checking policy.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

California Gov. Gavin Newsom notably took an already damaged PG&E to task on Thursday, saying the utility company’s “greed and mismanagement over the course of decades” was to blame for the state’s aging and poorly maintained electric grid, not simply climate change. (Last year’s Camp Fire in Northern California, sparked by a PG&E power line, was the state’s deadliest on record, claiming 86 lives and the town of Paradise; the company has since filed for bankruptcy.) Then this week, state officials called for the company to issue customer rebates, which would cost it millions, and demanded PG&E executives report to an emergency regulatory meeting planned for Friday.
Beyond blame, the dark days have also set Californians searching for new solutions—from a heavier reliance on renewable energy sources to municipal power distribution to microgrids, or local community-operated energy grids that can operate and be controlled autonomously. Still, even these alternatives come with questions about feasibility, equity, and who can afford to benefit from them.
Clean energy and utility policy expert Steven Weissman, for one, thinks these blackouts are bound to continue no matter what we do in the short term—though he argues not all is lost. In a New York Times op-ed Monday, he called the experience of utilities purposefully shutting off power “the new reliability” rather than “the new normal,” but says that if that “means less certainty from traditional grid-based power sources, then it also provides an opportunity beyond the old approach.” Weissman previously served as an administrative law judge at the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates privately-owned public utilities in the state, before he started the Energy Law program at the University of California, Berkeley.
I recently spoke with Weissman, now a public policy lecturer at the university, about the internal workings of PG&E  that led us here, what’s a fair or unfair critique of the utility, and what actually needs to happen to get everyone out of this mess. Below is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.
Was PG&E’s power shutdown really the only option?
Well, when are you asking that question? Because if Tuesday morning you look at the weather forecast, and it looks like there are going to be red flag conditions, and you might have the potential for catastrophic fire, is the shut off the only solution? The answer, then, is probably yes. But if you’re asking more of a long-term question: Did we have to get to this point where we’re having these massive shut offs? I think the answer is mostly no. Is the fact that they had to shut down so much of their system an indication of a failure? I think the answer is yes—clearly, yes. This is a company that has a very challenging system. It covers a tremendous territory. There’s 16 different climate zones. The system has a tremendous amount of complexity that’s kind of grown organically over more than a century. And all of those things are challenges for the company to be able to maintain its system safely.
You would have liked to have seen this company step back decades ago and recognize that all the things I just mentioned were the circumstances it was facing. Imagine how the story would be different if PG&E was now saying, “We’ve been worried about what’s going on now for the last 20 years, and we’ve been addressing the problem in the following comprehensive way. We created this new office, which was designed to look at these problems. We’ve hired the best experts from around the world to come in and work with us. We’ve used state-of-the-art technology.” First of all, maybe we wouldn’t have had all these cut offs. But if we did, at least we could say that this is a company that has done everything it can to wrap its arms around the challenges it faces. But we can’t tell this story.
What do you think of the talking point that’s emerged from PG&E’s critics, including Gov. Gavin Newson, that the company has put profits above people with this shutdown and the decisions leading to it?
It’s an easy thing to say, but it’s really too simplistic. There are two ways that a utility can make money: First is by continuing to invest in new capital projects. The other way is by spending less money than it’s given. What that means is that the regulatory structure gives the utility an incentive to over-invest in facilities and to underspend on operation and maintenance. With hindsight, it’s very easy to look and say the tower that sparked the Camp Fire, if you had put a little more money in operation and maintenance, you could have either strengthened that tower or you could have replaced it, and you didn’t do that. And so therefore, you’re putting profits ahead of safety.
But I think that the problem is much more ingrained in the way this company has developed and continues to operate than it is something as simple as just trying to make more money. Certainly, that incentive is there, and it probably has had an impact over time and resulted in less money being spent on keeping the system in good shape than it should have—maybe a lot less money than it should have. But focusing on that alone does not get to the fundamental underlying problem, which is a company that has not recognized the growing complexity of its system and hasn’t put processes in place to overcome that.
What should PG&E do now to deal with those issues?
I want to see the company openly acknowledge that it doesn’t have the right systems in place. I don’t see that yet. What it seems to be doing is saying, “We have to get a lot better in terms of maintaining our system, and so we’re trimming more trees and we’re doing more inspections.” That’s all great, but those are really fixes that don’t create assurance that operations will continue to be safe in the future. Because if you don’t change the way questions are asked, if you don’t change the accountability of people in different departments, if you don’t add in the right kind of experts, then you’re much more likely in the future to slip back into the same pattern, which is overspending on infrastructure, maybe building more transmission lines than you need, and not spending as much money on maintaining those lines as you should.
Is there a good possibility that we’ll see more of these kinds of extended power shut offs?
Clearly, PG&E is going to try to find ways to fine tune its strategy for invoking these power shut offs, but there’s no reason at this point to believe that they won’t continue to happen. We’re going to continue to see these shut offs into the indefinite future.
Short-term, PG&E can take steps like hardening and maintaining its infrastructure, but what other steps does it need to take to reduce long-term wildfire risk?
Well, I don’t think that’s a short-term fix. It’s going to take many years to take a system of that size and be able to improve the nature of all the equipment—many years and lots of billions of dollars.
But there are other elements here. One is they need to be more aggressive about placing lines in vulnerable areas underground. And part of that involves taking the underground budgets that they have—because they do have some money to spend every year on putting overhead lines underground—and prioritize that money only for safety issues. Traditionally, the money would be spent on putting lines underground at places where there may be some sort of view or it’s a pretty neighborhood or it’s a commercial district that’s trying to attract customers. That’s really not the priority now. The priority has to be safety. And so the question is where are the most vulnerable places? Spend the money there.
Another thing is a much more enthusiastic embrace of microgrids. If microgrids are installed well and involve underground circuits connecting people, then you have a system that can operate more safely year-round. They can help provide power when these outages do occur because you can isolate those microgrids and use the power there. More battery storage strategically located through communities at both the utility side of the meter and the customer side of the meter can be an important part of this. More self-generation can be a good thing as well as long as it’s managed properly.
These are all things that make it less burdensome when these outages do occur, but also might enable more power to be delivered safely. I think there’s going to be a natural response now on the part of a lot of commercial industrial customers and some communities that say, “If we’re going to have these shut offs, then we’re going to have our own backup power.”
That’s fine, but this is an opportunity to make sure that whatever backup power provided is renewable and relies on battery storage rather than using diesel generators. I’ve been in conversations with people at the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). When PG&E announced the shut off program, EBMUD went out and acquired a large number of diesel backup generators to put in its pumping stations. That’s a rational short-term response, but now the question is, will EBMUD undertake a program designed to rely on renewables and batteries and eliminate its reliance on diesel generators that are contributing in the long run to the overall problem?
Microgrids and local distribution seem to make a lot of sense, so what’s stopped them from being used more broadly?
The single biggest obstacle is that the utilities are not enthusiastic supporters of microgrids. The way that plays out is that state law gives the utilities exclusive monopoly service territories for being the distribution and transmission companies. There are some exceptions to that, and one exception is something in the law which people call the “over-the-fence rule.” What that says is if I’m generating, let’s say, solar power at my house, I can share it with my next door neighbors on either side of me, but I can’t, for instance, share it with a neighbor across the street, and I can’t share it with more than two other people. Until that provision in the law is changed to say that microgrids are always allowed, I think the utilities are going to continue to be able to basically put the brakes on any microgrid they’re not enthusiastic about.
The city of Berkeley wanted to put a microgrid in when it built this enormous new civic garage downtown. It wanted to put solar on the roof and batteries in the basement and then interconnect all the government buildings in the area so they could have reliable power even when there are other outages or other emergencies, and PG&E wouldn’t get behind it, and it didn’t happen. It’s sort of a schizophrenia here because the legislature has passed some bills that seem to be supportive of having a greater reliance on microgrids. But there’s a lot of resistance, and that resistance is coming from the utilities and probably on top of that the utility workers. Microgrids are supposed to operate in a way where people that are on a microgrid continue to get power off the greater grid unless there’s an outage, but I am suspecting some of the utilities are worried that if communities start out by being able to give themselves their own backup power, maybe eventually they’ll be given the permission to totally disconnect from the greater grid, and utilities do not want to lose customers.
One of the arguments against microgrids is that they are expensive, but with the economic burden brought on by wildfires, power shut downs, and the potential increase in energy costs as a result, do microgrids end up making more financial sense?
It’s hard to make a broad statement about every microgrid, but I’ll say this: I think what is happening now is we’re realizing that there’s a lot more cost involved in having distribution and transmission systems than we thought, both in terms of the losses when you don’t have reliable service, but also the liabilities from the wildfires. If building a line costs you a billion dollars, but eventually could expose you to a $15-billion liability if you cause a wildfire on that line, then maybe that line is more expensive than we thought it was. And if that’s the case, if we really built in the true cost of these things before deciding to have the utilities go build them, maybe other things would start looking better. Maybe rooftop solar, which some economists criticize as being a bad investment because it’s more expensive on a per-watt basis starts looking more cost effective. And maybe batteries don’t seem like such an expensive investment anymore. The whole formula and the whole set of expectations may change.
If cities took control of local power distribution—as San Francisco has been exploring—would that change things at all? [Ed note: PG&E rejected San Francisco’s $2.5 billion offer to buy the company’s local power lines last week.]
It provides an opportunity to change things because when you bring the control down to a local level, then you have a much more direct line of accountability. So if you’ve got San Francisco Public Utilities Commission as an elected board, and they screw up, then you answer to the voters. And because you’re a local official, and you live locally, you run into constituents in the street, and you go to meetings and you talk to people. The community-level values that are placed on something like safety and reliability can become much higher priorities for people running the system because of that local accountability.
Speculation has been popping up—even from some public officials—that basically PG&E could be extending shut offs unnecessarily in order to pressure the legislature into changing the inverse condemnation law, which holds California utilities responsible for wildfire damage caused by their equipment, regardless of negligence. Thoughts?
That’s an interesting one. I want to start this by saying that I think that the utilities have more urgent issues to deal with because regardless of how we want to demonize this company, no one wants to destroy communities, and no one wants to kill people. This is not an evil enterprise. It’s made up of lots of really good decent people. But as a whole the company just doesn’t seem to be as good as the people working there. But nonetheless, here you’re a utility and you’re going to the legislature and saying, “inverse condemnation is a terrible thing, and it shouldn’t apply to us, and if we’re not going to have a guarantee that the customers will reimburse us for any liabilities, then you need to eliminate it, and not have it applied to us.” One of the less-than-top priority, but nonetheless existing messages that comes out of these shut offs is, “Okay, fine. You don’t want to give us that kind of protection. Well, see how you feel about not having power.” And you do wonder about that.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In the span of a few hours, Mulvaney had covered the full spectrum of Trumpish protestation: from a wised-up “everyone does it” to a martyred cry of total innocennce.
Here’s what he told reporters hours ago:


When ABC News’ Jon Karl pointed out that what Mulvaney had said amounted to a quid pro quo, Mulvaney responded: “We do that all the time with foreign policy. Now, in a statement that starts with blaming the media for misconstruing what he told reporters, Mulvaney claimed that there actually “never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.”

	Politics","Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee and one of the central figures in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, died early on Thursday in Baltimore.
Cummings died of longstanding health challenges, his office said. He was 68.
One of the most powerful Democrats, Cummings had represented Maryland’s 7th congressional district for 23 years. Trump frequently targeted Cummings over his key role in investigations into the Trump administration. The president’s attacks included racist rants against Cummings, a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Upon hearing the news, many, including 2020 presidential candidates, posted tributes honoring Cummings:

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the panel’s chair, closed the hearing with a seemingly extemporaneous eight-minute speech. Expanding on his own earlier statement that “we’re better than this,” in reference to the president’s impact on the country, Cummings remarks were strikingly empathetic to Cohen, openly emotional, and morally urgent.
“I know that this has been hard,” Cummings told Cohen. “I know that you face a lot. I know that you are worried about your family, but this is part of your destiny and hopefully this portion of your destiny will lead to a better Michael Cohen, a better Donald Trump, a better Untied States of American, and a better world.”

Cummings died Thursday morning in his hometown of Baltimore, at 68, from what a spokesperson described Thursday only as “longstanding health challenges.”
Democrats will find a replacement for Cummings as oversight committee chair, and the panel, which is part of the House’s ongoing impeachment efforts, will continue the work it was doing under his leadership. That included looking into the White House’s use of a classified system to store potentially embarrassing or controversial call transcripts between Trump and world leaders; investigating the president’s alleged violations of the Constitution’s emoluments clause; and, beyond impeachment, looking into prescription drug costs and voting rights.
But Cummings’ remarks at the Cohen hearing highlight what Congress lost with his death. Elevated by Pelosi to the top spot on Oversight over a more senior colleague in 2010, he offered a sort of innate gravitas and a knack for articulating deeper themes behind legislation and oversight. And he wielded unique moral authority. That the Democrats cannot replace.
Near the close of his remarks at the Cohen hearing, Cummings issued a call to action that speaks to his legacy in public service: “When we’re dancing with the angels, the question will be asked, in 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact? Did we stand on the sidelines and say nothing? Did we play games?”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Two weeks later, after she’d been released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Gutierrez expressed her joy and optimism on a Facebook post accompanying a photo of her on a plane. “My first flight in the United States,” wrote Gutierrez, who now lives in Florida. “Thank you, heavenly father—to all my brothers in Christ and friends who were part of this with their prayers.”
But when couples come to the border seeking asylum, ICE often keeps the man in detention. That’s what happened to Hernández, who was eventually sent to the Richwood Correctional Center, a jail in rural Louisiana with a well-documented history of abuse. When the couple spoke for the last time on October 9, Hernández had just gotten bad news. The next court date in his asylum case wouldn’t be until late January, nearly four months away. He sounded hopeless and said he couldn’t endure more detention. Hernández knew he was at a for-profit jail and figured he wouldn’t get out as long as someone was making money off of him.
On Tuesday, Hernández, 43, was found unresponsive in his cell. Medical officials pronounced him dead soon after. His death, which is still under investigation, appeared to be a suicide by hanging.
Several Richwood detainees told me that Hernández went on a hunger strike after his January court date was set. They say he was then sent to one of the solitary confinement cells that Spanish-speaking detainees call “punishment rooms” and “wells.” ICE spokesperson Bryan Cox confirmed that Hernández was placed in “administrative segregation for observation and monitoring due to a declared hunger strike” on October 10 and that he was alone in his cell. On Wednesday afternoon, ICE released a statement saying that Hernández appeared to have died by “self-inflicted strangulation.”
Hernández’s death is the first to occur as part of ICE’s rapid shift toward detaining asylum seekers at for-profit jails in Louisiana and Mississippi. This year, ICE has started using eight new jails and prisons in those states as part of its rapid expansion of its detention capacity. Six of them in Louisiana, including Richwood, are run by LaSalle Corrections and were built to hold criminals, a population that is in shorter supply as a result of the state’s criminal justice reforms. The other two are operated by the private prison giants GEO Group and CoreCivic. ICE is now keeping roughly 8,000 people in Louisiana, up from about 1,600 on an average day in 2016. Congress has directed ICE to detain fewer people, but the Department of Homeland Security has gotten around legislators by transferring money to ICE from other accounts.
Many of the new ICE facilities were once notorious for mistreating their criminal populations. Complaints by inmates at the CoreCivic prison in Mississippi about inadequate medical care, staff mistreatment, and rotten food contributed to a 2012 riot that left one guard dead and 20 people injured. A 2016 investigation by the Nation documented three cases where immigrants serving criminal sentences at the prison died following poor medical treatment. At Richwood, two inmates died in 2015 as a result of what lawsuits allege was severe neglect and abuse. In 2016, Richwood guards pepper-sprayed handcuffed detainees in the face then engaged in a criminal conspiracy to cover up the assault.
Mother Jones first learned of Hernández’s death on Tuesday afternoon from a woman with a brother detained at Richwood who had told her of the death. Later on Tuesday, another Richwood detainee and a lawyer representing migrants at Richwood told me the same thing. The second detainee was a Venezuelan who had heard about the death from a jail employee he trusts. The employee had told him that Hernández hanged himself with his clothes and a bag used to store personal belongings. The Venezuelan said he also saw a guard open a small window that looked into Hernández’s cell. After apparently seeing Hernández’s body, the detainee heard the guard say, “What the fuck?” Another employee looked like he was going to vomit, the Venezuelan added.
About 90 minutes after he was pronounced dead, an ICE official called Gutierrez to tell her that her husband had died in the agency’s custody. She pressed for more details, but the official didn’t provide any. Gutierrez told me on Wednesday that she had heard people were saying her husband had committed suicide. Hernández had never mentioned self-harm, and she didn’t believe the reports. Gutierrez described her husband as a tranquil man of few words who fought for what he believed in. She said he’d left Cuba after repeatedly clashing with the government.
“Today, it was my husband, but how many have there been before?” Gutierrez asked in Spanish, “How many more will there be if we don’t get this under control?”
She continued, “Sadly, we can’t understand what’s going on in this country that the whole world comes to take refuge in. Look at what’s happening today. You just don’t know if they’re getting asylum or dying.”
Hernández was the first asylum seeker to lose his life at Richwood, but several inmates died there previously as a result of what lawsuits describe as severe mistreatment. In October 2015, Vernon White and Erie Moore were placed together in an isolation cell following erratic behavior and fighting, according to lawsuits later brought on their behalf. They fought the next morning, but prison officials still kept them detained together. That afternoon, White began banging on the door of the cell before Moore attacked him. After about 10 minutes of struggle, White’s body disappeared from surveillance footage. Seventeen minutes later, a guard delivered food to the cell without noticing that Moore had already killed or incapacitated White. Moore then ate from both meals without disruption.
Finally, 46 minutes after the attack, guards entered the cell to remove what appeared to be White’s dead body. Christopher Loring and other guards then pepper-sprayed and severely beat Moore. Investigators from the local sheriff’s office arrived at the jail to find Moore lying on his back, unresponsive. He was airlifted to a hospital and died there a month later. (The lawsuit filed on White’s behalf was settled in July 2018 for an undisclosed sum; Moore’s case is still in court.)
A year later, Loring and four other guards participated in an assault and cover-up that led to criminal convictions. In March 2018, the Justice Department charged the Richwood guards with pepper-spraying inmates “while the inmates were kneeling on the floor, in an area of the jail with no surveillance cameras, and while the inmates were handcuffed, compliant, and not posing a physical threat to anyone.” The guards then conspired to blame an inmate for the incident by submitting false reports. Loring later lied to the FBI. He pleaded guilty in March, shortly before asylum seekers started arriving at Richwood.
In Richwood, a majority-black town of about 3,300 in northern Louisiana, the shift to holding immigrants was controversial. “We do not need these strange prisoners coming to the town,” a resident said at the time. “We would be afraid to try to come home, our children playing.” The mayor defended the decision, noting on a local podcast that ICE was set to pay the jail more than twice as much as the state of Louisiana. A portion of those funds would go to the town government. “You’re looking at somewhere around $470,000 a year for us to do just about nothing,” the mayor said.
After facing protests at its detention centers in progressive states like California, ICE has been happy to shift immigrants to cheaper jails in Louisiana that are far from lawyers and close to conservative judges. The new LaSalle jails are all in the Western District of Louisiana, where President Donald Trump has appointed five of the six federal judges.
Hernández repeatedly asked to be released on parole, but ICE denied each request. An internal government report obtained by BuzzFeed News shows that his last request was denied on October 8, the day before his court hearing. According to ICE’s own parole policy, the agency should probably have released him, but it had effectively ended parole in the Deep South. In 2016, the ICE field office that covers Louisiana approved 75 percent of parole requests. By 2019, that figure had dropped to zero. In September, a federal judge ordered ICE to return to following its parole policy, which requires it to release asylum seekers who don’t pose a flight risk or a threat to the community. Attorneys with clients in Louisiana have seen little or no change since the judge’s decision. (Cubans are particularly unlikely to be flight risks because they become eligible for green cards under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act one year after they’re released.)
Hernández had often told his wife that his goal was to make it home. “For him, the United States was home,” she explained. “His hope. His future, for his family, for him.” He hoped to escape Cuba. Instead, she said the opposite had happened as “his life in the United States became hell.”
Sadly, Hernández’s story is not unique. Within 24 hours of his apparent suicide, another detainee at Richwood attempted to take his life.
On Tuesday afternoon, shortly after Hernández died, I spoke with Manuel, a Honduran asylum seeker who has been detained at Richwood for six months. I asked how he was doing. “Pretty bad, to be honest,” he said. “Being in a punishment cell isn’t easy. Spending more than 40 days without seeing the light of the sun. It’s been torture for me. Torture by ICE.” The 27-year-old, who is gay, said he’d been sent to solitary confinement after telling a judge he had been hit by a fellow inmate—an incident that occurred after the inmate called him a homophobic slur. He was brought to what he described as a blood-stained cell. After about a month there, he began to hear voices. He thought of killing himself with a knife, but couldn’t get one.
He was kept in that solitary cell for more than 40 days, then transferred to another windowless isolation cell, this time with a cellmate, where he spent the next two months. He was allowed outside for an hour a day and could bathe three times per week. Manuel considered committing suicide by jumping off the top level of his bunk bed head first, but he feared it wouldn’t kill him. Homophobia and racism on the part of ICE officials made him feel “that his life was worth nothing,” he said with obvious pain.
An investigation by the Project on Government Oversight showed that about 40 percent of people placed in solitary confinement at ICE detention centers have mental illnesses. The Atlantic reported in September that the Trump administration has been far more likely to send people to solitary because of “suicide risk” or as “protective custody for LGBT people.” (Cox did not respond to questions about Manuel.)
Manuel’s first video call with a psychologist lasted no more than five minutes, he said. The second lasted maybe 20. The psychologist prescribed sleeping pills to deal with the voices and nightmares, and Prozac for his sadness. She also wrote a letter to ICE saying that he was potentially suicidal, he said. Before we hung up, I asked if he could call again the next day. “Sure, no problem,” he replied.
On Wednesday, I got a call, but it wasn’t from Manuel. Another detainee, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said Manuel had hanged himself around 6:30 that morning. A guard found him unconscious, but he survived the suicide attempt, the detainee said. He’d been taken to the hospital and brought back to the jail.
The detainee and I had spoken the day before. He didn’t know about Hernández’s death at the time but didn’t doubt that months of detention and parole denials could drive someone to take his own life. “If someone killed himself, that’s why,” he said. “Because of that, I’ve seen many shattered people crying on the floor because they can’t take it. Because of that, I’ve seen people ask to self-deport, even though they’ll be killed when they get back to their countries.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The research shows the Russian government’s apparent hacking of foreign government targets remains robust and active, and that the attackers have found ways to conduct operations even after the high profile attacks on the US presidential election brought unprecedented public attention to their efforts.
The report, titled “Operation Ghost: The Dukes aren’t back—they never left,” details how the group known variously as Cozy Bear, APT29, or the Dukes—which was one of two Russian-intelligence linked groups found to have hacked the DNC—has used a variety of methods to remain active even as they were under the eyes of the world’s major intelligence services. According to the report, the group has been targeting foreign ministries in at “least three different countries in Europe” and European diplomats in the United States; additional victims are likely, the authors note, but because the hackers used unique setups for each attack they were not able to identify them.
“We spent months apparently chasing a ghost then, a few months ago, we were able to attribute several distinct intrusions to the Dukes,” the authors wrote, explaining a difficult research process based on analyzing code, shared infrastructure, malware operations, and overlaps with previous attacks. The report details the group’s harnessing of some previously unseen tools combined with tactics and methods from previous known attacks, including the use of Twitter and Reddit to host URLs related to the operations, Dropbox, and steganography—hiding data within other data, in this case concealing information enabling the attacks in innocuous-looking photos.
“Operation Ghost shows that the Dukes never stopped their espionage activities,” the authors wrote. “They might pause for a while and re-appear in another form, but they still need to spy to fulfill their mandates.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But I’m a little puzzled. I may be misreading something, but once you cut through the fog it appears that everyone has agreed that there will be no customs border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Instead, goods will travel freely between Ireland (part of the EU) and Northern Ireland (not part of the EU) and Britain will then sort out all applicable customs and tariffs internally. In other words, there’s now a de facto border between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain.
But this has always been one of the options on the table. Why is it acceptable now if it wasn’t two years ago?
Part of the answer, I suppose, is that October 31 is increasingly looking like a real deadline, and the prospect of a hard no-deal Brexit has concentrated everyone’s minds. Another possibility is that it’s not acceptable even now: we won’t know until Parliament votes on it. If Labour opposes the deal and DUP opposes the deal, it might fail.

Those of us willing to flatly own up to being atheists make up a tiny, tiny minority.

The decision poses perhaps the largest conflict of interest yet for a leader whose presidency is riddled with them, thanks to Trump’s refusal to separate himself from his personal business empire.
Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney made the announcement Thursday afternoon at a White House press conference, where he claimed the controversial decision would not violate the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which prohibits top federal officials from accepting payments or gifts from foreign governments. Mulvaney claimed the summit would be hosted “at cost,”  though it’s unclear how the Trump Organization proposes to ensure that and, moreover, any revenue would still boost the resort’s bottom line.

Despite Trump’s claims he does not profit from his position, he retains full ownership of his business empire, including the Doral resort. The president says he no longer has day-to-day control of his businesses, but he retains the ability to withdraw money from them at any point, and the mortgages on the Doral are listed as his own personal liabilities.
Trump purchased the Doral property in 2012 for $150 million, borrowing $125 million from Deutsche Bank to fund the purchase. Since then, the venture has not flourished. Bringing in thousands of members of foreign delegations—at the expense of each country’s taxpayers—would be a huge boost for the property.
Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group that previously filed a complaint about the inclusion of Doral on a list of potential G7 sites, said that Trump is using the US government’s international power and influence to promote his personal business interests.
“The president is now officially using the power of his office to help prop up his struggling golf business. There appears to be no bottom to President Trump’s corruption,” he said in a statement. “What matters most to him is his personal profit and personal advancement, not the best interests of the American people. There is now no question that the American government is being used as a public relations and marketing subsidiary of the Trump Organization.”
The G7 summit annually brings together the leaders of the world’s seven largest economies, along with a slew of other foreign leaders and delegations hoping to push an issue or hold talks on the sidelines of the event. The United States last hosted the G7 in 2012. President Barack Obama’s administration initially planned to convene the event in downtown Chicago, but because of security concerns it held the conference at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. Member countries take turns hosting the event, and it is usually held at a high-end resort or conference center—and typically the summits cost a lot of money. The most recent G7, held in Biarritz, France, in August, was estimated to have cost French taxpayers about $40.5 million. But those are just the costs of hosting the event—the member delegations are responsible for paying for lodging and other expenses.
USASpending.gov, a government website that tracks federal expenditures, lists at least 10 payments to the Biarritz hotel where the most recent G7 summit was held, totaling at least $1.4 million for accommodation and “hotel services.” It’s unclear if this reflects the full bill for the American G7 delegation or if there were other costs. But if seven delegations spent roughly that much at Trump’s Doral resort, that would amount to $9.8 million in revenue.
In Trump’s annual personal financial disclosure, Doral has shown declining revenues—from $92 million in 2015 to about $75 million in 2018. At the same time, according to local property tax filings, the resort’s profitability slipped from $13.8 million to $4.3 million between 2015 and 2017. The club also seems to be having a hard time attracting new members. Under the club’s rules, members who resign can get their initial deposit fees returned—but for one departing member to be reimbursed, four new members must sign up. In August, the Miami Herald reported that only two departing members received refunds between December 2017 and January 2019, suggesting that only eight new members joined the club in that period.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Mulvaney is right: presidents do #1 all the time. Domestic politics invariably affects foreign policy, sometimes crassly and sometimes not.
But #2? Presidents absolutely don’t do that all the time. This is not “domestic politics.” It’s using the official power of the US government to force a foreign country to smear a political opponent.

I continue to be more on Zuckerberg’s side than on the conventional lefty side of this. As always, my fundamental concern when anyone suggests a restriction on free speech is, “Who decides?” I don’t want the government deciding, and I’m not sure I really want Mark Zuckerberg deciding either.
Let’s dive a little deeper, though. This whole affair reminds me of concerns about the early blogosphere: Why, those bloggers can say anything! They can even lie and not suffer any consequences!
Quite so. And that’s been true of speech since the founding of the country. In general, the question isn’t whether speech is true, but whether it’s actionable. If it is, and if you want to do something about it, you go to court.
But wait: maybe that’s OK for blogs, which have a pretty small audience. Facebook, however, has an enormous audience. Can we really allow such a big platform to remain unregulated?
I think so. After all, freedom of speech doesn’t mean much if it only applies to small platforms. Let’s consider two other platforms that are probably as big or bigger than Facebook:
This is no easy problem. But keep a couple of things in mind. First, outrageously false Facebook posts are inherently limited in their influence because they have to stay targeted. If everyone sees them, they can do more harm than good.

Giuliani, who is President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, says that the two men, who federal prosecutors charged with violating campaign-finance law, have helped him seek political dirt in Ukraine on former Vice President Joe Biden and other matters. Giuliani also says he represents Parnas and Fruman, as their attorney, on unspecified other matters. The former New York mayor has also seemed to say he mulled participating in gas deal in Uzbekistan with Parnas. Exactly what went on between Giuliani and the two men is complicated, but it is important: Prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating Rudy’s financial dealings with Parnas and Fruman, CNN reported Thursday. Lest he lose track, here are claims regarding what, exactly, Giuliani was up to with Parnas and Fruman.
They helped Giuliani with his representation of Trump: In an October 3 letter sent to the House Intelligence Committee, John Dowd—who worked for Trump in 2017 and 2018 and recently agreed to represent Parnas and Fruman—claimed that Parnas and Fruman “assisted Mr. Giuliani in connection with his representation of President Trump.” That is, Dowd suggested that Parnas and Fruman, who are not lawyers, were effectively part of Trump’s legal team
This claim refers to Parnas and Fruman’s widely reported role helping to put Giuliani in contact with former government officials in Ukraine who claimed to have information helpful to Trump. They offered information intended to call into question the August 2016 revelation that Trump’s then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort had secretly received $12.7 million from allies of Ukraine’s former president. The officials also boosted the conspiracy theory that Biden had forced the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor to stop an investigation into a Ukrainian gas company that hired his son, Hunter Biden.
As part of this work, Parnas and Fruman, also assisted Joseph DiGenova and Victoria Toensing, a husband wife team of attorneys and Fox News pundits, who were also digging for dirt in Ukraine, according to Dowd’s letter.
They hired Giuliani as their lawyer: Giuliani has also repeatedly claimed that he works for Parnas and Fruman. Giuliani has said little about what they hired him for or when, though the New York Times reported Thursday that Parnas hired Giuliani last year to represent a company he runs, called Fraud Guarantee, and has paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars. In May, Giuliani tweeted that Parnas and Fruman “are my clients” and that he advised them to press charges against a notorious Ukrainian oligarch, Igor Kolomoisky, an ally of Ukrainian president Zolodymyr Zelensky, who had criticized them. Giuliani has also cited attorney-client privilege in declining to detail his work with Parnas and Fruman. And Dowd, in his letter, said the two men “have also been represented by Mr. Giuliani in connection with various personal and business affairs.” In a text message Thursday, Giuliani said that his representation of Fruman and Parnas did not relate to actions for which they were indicted. Giuliani has no apparent role in defending Parnas and Fruman against the criminal charges they face.
They had other business with Giuliani: Giuliani also seems to have suggested other financial involvement with Parnas. In a October 7 article, the Associated Press reported that Giuliani met on March 24 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington with Parnas and woman named Healy Baumgardner, a former Trump campaign advisor and onetime Guiliani spokesperson who runs a Houston based firm called the “45 Energy Group,” a so-called “government relations, public affairs and business development practice” firm. “Giuliani, Parnas, and Baumgardner were there to make a business pitch involving gas deals in the former Soviet bloc to a potential investor,” the AP article says. Giuliani claimed the deals discussed in this meeting involved Uzbekistan, not Ukraine. “I have not pursued a deal in the Ukraine. I don’t know about a deal in the Ukraine. I would not do a deal in the Ukraine now, obviously,” Giuliani told the AP. “There is absolutely no proof that I did it, because I didn’t do it.”
Giuliani apparently hoped to participate in this Uzbekistasn deal, not just act as an attorney. Per the New York Times, Giuliani and his associates hoped to be paid “at least $100,000 for the project, on which Mr. Parnas offered advice.” In another text message Thursday to me, Giuliani said the Uzbekistan deal “has nothing to do with” Parnas and Fruman. Asked why Parnas was in the Trump Hotel meeting then, Giuliani did not respond.
To review, Trump’s former lawyer, Dowd, and current lawyer, Giuliani, both say they represent Parnas and Fruman. (Manafort’s former lead counsel, Kevin Downing, also represented Parnas and Fruman at a hearing in federal court in Virginia on Thursday, saying he was “asked” to help them before they are dispatched to New York.) Giuliani says Parnas and Fruman helped him work for Trump seeking dirt on Biden, and that he worked for them on other matters. Also he may have talked about doing a gas deal with Parnas in Uzbekistan. Having trouble tracking all that? It seems like Giuliani is too.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Without US troops preventing Turkish forces from attacking the Kurds—who had been longtime allies in the fight against ISIS in northern Syria—Turkey has swept into the region. Now it’s bombing Kurdish territory and attacking Kurdish fighters and civilians.
More than 160,000 people have been displaced from rural Syria as a result of the fighting, according to the UN, which estimates that 400,000 civilians will require aid because of the violence. The BBC reports that at least 11 civilians have been killed.
In 2018, Mother Jones reporter Shane Bauer traveled to Syria to document the United States’ involvement there. He met the Kurds who Trump effectively gave Turkey permission to kill. On this week’s episode of the Mother Jones Podcast, Bauer dials in for a conversation with host Jamilah King about what’s going on—and what’s next in one of the 21st century’s bloodiest catastrophes.
Listen to the full episode, or read a lightly edited transcript, below.

Shane, let’s start with your gut-level reaction to this week’s news. Tough doesn’t even begin to describe it.
It’s a shock, honestly. It’s not something that was unexpected, but still, the way that the developments in Syria have unfolded have been really quick and really dramatic. It feels devastating.
The region of northeast Syria that I’ve been to a couple times in the last year was quite stable. It was a kind of safe area where refugees from other parts of the country had come, and it’s now a war zone being invaded by Syrian proxies for Turkey. It’s being shelled by Turkey over the border. The Syrian regime is moving to grab what parts of the country that it can, so everything is up in the air right now. But it all seems to have been quite destabilized.
What has hit you the hardest?
There have been, in just over a week, 160,000 people displaced. It feels like a brand new phase of the war, which has been going on for eight years. What has impacted me the most about this particular case is that this was directly caused by the United States. Trump made a very sudden decision to pull troops back from the border with Turkey, essentially allowing Turkey to launch an invasion—which it has been wanting to do for a very long time—against the Kurdish forces, which Turkey considers an enemy, but who control the area.
These people have been allies of the United States in the war against ISIS. The Syrian Democratic Forces have lost about 11,000 people in the war against ISIS with the cover of American airpower. As soon as that war was finished, the US essentially tossed them to their main enemy, which is Turkey. So it really looks like a stab in the back to these people who we were fighting alongside, and who we were essentially protecting.
What are you learning from people on the ground or closer to the conflict? I guess it’s made even harder by the fact that you’re a journalist, and journalists themselves are fleeing, but what can you tell us?
There were some international journalists there several days after this US pullback was announced. As far as I know, all of them have left. The Syrian Democratic Forces have been forced to make an agreement with the Syrian regime, which they had not been allied with in the past. Because of this agreement, journalists have feared that the regime will come back, and they could potentially be arrested.
I’ve been relying on reporters in the region who are talking to local officials, both in Turkey and Syria. So it’s really a combination of all this, and then trying to suss out all of the contradictions that appear on social media whenever there’s a quickly developing situation.
You mentioned that you’ve been in this area a couple of times in the past year. Describe who’s there and what it’s been like when you’ve been there.
The area that we’re talking about is about a third of Syria. It’s the northeast part of the country. It has several small and medium-sized cities. It encompasses most of the Kurdish area. Kurds are the largest minority in Syria, outside of its Arab population. And it also includes territories formerly controlled by ISIS, like the city of Raqqa and the far east of the country, which is very rural.
Being there, generally it has felt safe, especially in the Kurdish areas where there was this grassroots system of democracy. People actually had their own small system where they would elect local representatives and work out political issues, really on the neighborhood level, and then send representatives to higher and higher bodies. So there was an actual functioning system of this very unique type of grassroots democracy. There was a sense of hope and excitement.
Why did Turkey want to invade this part of Syria?
The group in control of that part of Syria is a party that is allied with the PKK, which is a Kurdish party in Turkey. It is a left-wing party that has been fighting the Turkish state at various times since then 1980s. The group in Syria, however, has not been fighting Turkey. But Turkey has always been threatened by the existence of this group, and Turkey has been waiting for any opportunity to strike.
You mentioned the Kurds have been US allies. What have been the biggest successes of the US–Kurdish alliance in the past?
In Syria, it’s the defeat of ISIS. It was really the alliance between the Kurds and their allies in the Syrian Democratic Forces and the US Special Forces and their airpower that was able to ultimately defeat ISIS. It was a years-long war that they fought together, taking city by city, and it was a very destructive war. The city of Raqqa was destroyed with US airpower, but last year, ISIS lost the last bit of its territory.
These ISIS captives have been under the control of the Kurdish-led forces. A lot of these ISIS prisoners are internationals. This is something that President Trump has brought up: The countries they come from generally are refusing to take them back. There are thousands of ISIS prisoners in northeast Syria, and since this Turkish incursion started a week ago, there have been escapes. There are major fears of a prison break.
Speaking of Trump, he seems to be getting away with the idea that Americans simply won’t care. He tweeted that Syria was 7,000 miles away. Is he right?
It seems to me there has been a pretty strong reaction in the US, including among Republicans, who have chided Trump for turning against our allies. I think it remains to be seen where this is going. Trump has said he’s going to put sanctions on Turkey because of their actions in Syria. It’s a bit strange because everybody knew this is what would happen if the US gave the green light like it did. I’ll be curious to see whether these sanctions whitewash what Trump did, and how Republicans will react to that.
Finally, what would you like American audiences—our listeners—to keep in mind as they try to get their heads around this ongoing catastrophe?
The part about this that Americans are paying attention to is the ISIS threat, and this is a major concern. These people all breaking out of prison is obviously not going to be good for anybody. At the same time, it’s important for people far away from Syria to understand that this is a part of Syria that has had a relatively normal life. This is a place where children are going to school, families are working, people are meeting in cafes. It is the closest that Syria has had in a very long time to normalcy, and suddenly, people’s live are being ripped apart. People are having to flee, people are being killed. There have been civilians executed on highways or activists being killed. This is being perpetrated by our ally, Turkey. This is a member of NATO. This is not ISIS. These are people that are close to us, that we support.

Help me, the man pleaded with the travel agent. My country, Kuwait, has just been invaded, and I need to change an airplane ticket for job interviews.
The travel agent, risking his own job if he were to help, took the leap and made magic happen for the traveler by changing the ticket—and also opened his own wallet to give that stranger $80, a gesture of selfless support.
In the nearly 30 years since that fleeting moment, that traveler—scientist Mahmoud Ghannoum—got the job, settled into the United States, and has become the world’s leading microbiome (gut bacteria, probiotics) researcher.
But he never got to thank the travel agent who’d showed self-sacrificing kindness and helped make the rest of Ghannoum’s life happen. After a search online, Ghannoum found Elaine Dorsey, who remembered her husband, Jimmy, telling her about that day at the travel agency, the man who needed help, the cash Jimmy gave him. “It wasn’t out of the norm for him to do something like this,” Elaine Dorsey told the Washington Post’s Paula Dvorak.
Jimmy Dorsey, a Vietnam vet, volunteer firefighter, and youth football coach, died in February at 69 after a decade-long struggle with liver and lung cancer. But the Dorseys and the Ghannoums are making plans to meet to honor Jimmy’s memory.
Elaine Dorsey hopes that the sudden surfacing of her husband’s act of kindness will inspire people to follow Jimmy’s lead.

Don’t call me hero. Mike Stapleton said he was just doing his job, driving his cab in the wee hours, when he saw a car crushed under an overpass, smoke billowing from its hood. Inside were two unconscious men, and two women screaming, all teenagers. He stopped. One by one, he pulled them to safety as a fire grew under the dashboard. Then the car exploded. On October 7, Stapleton won the Royal Canadian Humane Association Canada Bravery Award for the rescue in St. John’s, Newfoundland. “I think they’re making too much of it,” Stapleton said. “Listen, you’re a human being, you got to do it. You see smoke, you’ve got to remove them.” (CBC)
“The People’s Farmer.” Gail Taylor had a promising public policy career. These days, she heads weekly toward Capitol Hill—not to lobby, but to distribute food for her neighbors. On a farm 3 and a half miles from the White House, Taylor grows dark green cucumbers, hardneck garlic, orange and purple carrots, red gooseberries, yellow plums, and heirloom tomatoes. Nearly 200 people support and share in the bounty of her Three Part Harmony farm. Taylor began weeding and transporting as an avocation on a community farm, and it became a calling. “I loved it. I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I never have to turn on a computer again.’” DC lawmaker David Grosso said she has inspired efforts to reclaim urban land for agriculture and help people follow her path. “She’s definitely the people’s farmer,” added Marla Karina Larrave, a food justice advocate and member of Taylor’s community agriculture program. “In terms of farming, you’re talking to the most awesome person in DC.” (Civil Eats)
Vet’s best friend. Nick Leist served two tours in Iraq and has PTSD and limited mobility to show for it. One night, as he was starting to have a night terror, he felt the nose of Tess, his German shepherd, on his face. She knew, he said; she’s helped him many times during the year he’s had a service dog. A bipartisan bill in Congress would allow vets to access service dogs as part of work-therapy programs—and give some vets the opportunity to adopt the dogs. Research has shown service dogs can help mental health, improve interpersonal relationships, and lower substance abuse risk, said one sponsor, Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. The bill is “a good start,” said Leist. “It’s something to get it out there to bring it more light and [show] how they help people.” Thanks to Samantha Power for the story tip. (Livingston Daily)

According to data collected by the communications agency Bully Pulpit Interactive, spending on pro-Trump ads on the two social networks increased five-fold between September 21 to October 5 compared to the previous two weeks. The Trump campaign, pro-Trump super-PACs, and other pro-Trump groups spent slightly over $5 million in this period, the most that they’ve spent in any two-week period. The 14 Democratic presidential candidates spent a combined $3.7 million during those two weeks.
Since the congressional inquiry began, Trump’s campaign committee and pro-Trump groups have spent over $1.1 million on Facebook ads directly related to impeachment. That’s more than Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has spent on all Facebook and Google ads during the same time. The only Democratic candidate who has been spending significantly on impeachment-focused ads is Tom Steyer, who has spent nearly $214,000.
In one of the Facebook ads paid for by the president’s 2020 campaign committee, Trump calls on his supporters to stop the “fake news witch hunts” and asks them to “stand with Trump.”

Fewer than 30 percent of those women, who were assaulted by force or while they were unable to consent, filed a report or sought help or counseling from their schools—typically because they believed they could handle it alone, were too embarrassed or ashamed, or felt that what they had experienced was not serious enough to merit assistance.
The survey of more than 181,000 students, conducted last spring and published this week by the Association of American Universities, is the largest of its kind. It is the second iteration of another large study published in 2015, which included data from many of the same institutions and had broadly similar results. “The disturbing news from this year’s survey is that sexual assault and misconduct remain far too prevalent among students at all levels of study,” AAU president Mary Sue Coleman wrote in a letter accompanying the results.
Over the last four years, sexual assault rates on the 21 campuses that participated in both surveys rose by a couple of percentage points on average for undergraduate women and men (about seven percent of whom reported nonconsensual sexual contact by force or while they were unable to consent). The rate for transgender, genderqueer, and nonbinary students stayed steady at around 23 percent, not a statistically significant change from 2015.

According to David Cantor, a senior statistical fellow at the research firm Westat and lead author of the report, it’s unclear whether the small increase reflects a rising rate of sexual assault, or whether it’s the result of other factors. “MeToo may have led to a somewhat different mix of students responding to the survey,” Cantor explains. But even as student awareness of sexual assault has grown, Cantor says there is no evidence that the survey was influenced by more students recognizing incidents of sexual assault as such.
Many of the schools that participated in the survey have been at the center of recent controversies over sexual misconduct, including alleged sexual harassment of graduate students by faculty members at the University of Rochester and a high-profile rape trial at Yale University. At the University of Virginia, the subject of a 2014 retracted Rolling Stone article about a later-discredited report of gang rape at a fraternity house, 13 percent of undergraduate women reported experiencing penetrative sexual assault by force, threats, or while they were unable to consent or stop what was happening—the same rate as in 2015.
At Stanford University, which has been roiled by sexual misconduct as well as the administration’s handling of Brock Turner’s sexual assault of Chanel Miller in 2015, just 29 percent of undergraduate women believed that if they reported a sexual assault to the school, administrators would conduct a fair investigation. Stanford Provost Persis Drell called the result a “distressing finding” in a letter to the campus. “Despite many efforts at Stanford over the years, it is evident that much more needs to be done.”
Some of the highest rates of sexual assault were reported at the University of Southern California, where a Los Angeles Times investigation last year revealed hundreds of sexual assault accusations against George Tyndall, a former gynecologist in the university’s student health clinic. According to the new survey, about 37 percent of undergraduate women at USC reported some type of nonconsensual sexual contact since enrolling, and 31 percent said they experienced sexual assault by force or while they were unable to consent.
The aggregate survey report published by the Association of American Universities emphasizes that the results likely don’t apply to all American college students. The participating universities were not randomly selected, and researchers found wide variability among campuses—including for reported rates of sexual assault among undergraduate women that ranged from 14 to 32 percent.
“This is a very specific group of universities,” says Morgan Dewey, communications director for End Rape on Campus, an advocacy group for campus sexual assault survivors. “They are elite schools. What this does not include is what’s happening at trade schools, at tech schools, what’s happening at high schools.” She notes that there is no data on historically black colleges and universities, as well as schools that serve large populations of Latinx, Asian American, and Native students.
The study’s authors defend their findings against the familiar criticism that such surveys do not accurately portray student experiences due to a phenomenon known as non-response bias. According to this theory, since only a fraction of students decide to take these non-mandatory surveys, the group that opts in may disproportionally include those who have experienced sexual assault. Cantor, who has has analyzed both the 2015 and 2019 survey results for non-response bias, says that the data for undergraduate women may be skewed—but only by 2 or 3 percentage points at most. And even if the numbers were adjusted downward, he points out, “the data are still many times higher than what is suggested by official reports of sexual misconduct.”
In their final report, the authors emphasize how common the experience of sexual assault is among young adults, on campus and off—even as they urge against alarmism. “Of the few studies that have been conducted, the conclusion is that college students have lower [sexual assault] rates than those not in college,” they wrote. “The prevalence rates discussed in this report should not be interpreted as an indication that attending a 4-year school is extraordinarily dangerous.” In other words, danger is the norm.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","It didn’t take long for the candidates at Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate to call for President Donald Trump’s impeachment.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said that Congress needs to impeach Trump to ensure the survival of the Constitution. “This is about Donald Trump,” she said. “But understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) took to superlatives, calling Trump “the most corrupt president in the history of this country.”
“I think that the House will find him worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause,” he said. “This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous.”
It’s not just incumbent on the House to impeach Trump, Sanders said. “Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.”
Former Vice President Joe Biden said he agrees, reiterating what he said when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the start of an impeachment inquiry: that he’d support impeachment if the White House continued to stonewall Congress. Trump “is the most corrupt president in modern history, and I think all of our history,” he said. House Democrats “have no choice but to move.”
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said that, as a former prosecutor, she can tell Trump has shown a “clear consciousness of guilt.” She, like Biden and Sanders, referred to Trump as “corrupt.”
“Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president,” she said. “And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments, and so Congress must act.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Moderators Immediately Pivoted to Jobs.,Becca Andrews,MotherJones,Politics,"For the first time since the first round of Democratic debates nearly four months ago, a Democratic candidate finally brought up reproductive health care onstage—and she did it without a direct prompt.
“This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle; not nearly one word with all of the discussions about health care, on women’s access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today,” said California Sen. Kamala Harris. “It’s outrageous.”

Harris refocused the discussion during a contentious back-and-forth over Medicare for All to make her point, saying that Republicans are putting women’s lives at risk with their extreme anti-abortion policies. “There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare,” she said, “and it is not an exaggeration to say that women will die—poor women, women of color will die because these Republican legislators in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.”
In June, after a six-week ban on abortion passed in the Georgia legislature, the candidates pledged their support onstage for a woman’s right to choose. Eight other states have passed bans on abortion that stand in direct challenge to the rights established in Roe v. Wade, and the Supreme Court has agreed to take up a case on the constitutionality of a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital.
Harris was primed to make this point, as she did on Twitter last month after the debates:

He led every national poll for months and was the centerpiece of every debate stage he appeared on. A procession of younger challengers took turns trying to draw blood—Eric Swalwell, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Julian Castro. Over the last month, Biden’s centrality to the race has taken on a new dimension, as the House of Representatives investigates whether President Donald Trump committed an impeachable offense in asking the government of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.
But for most of Tuesday’s debate in Ohio, Biden was largely an afterthought. Instead, Elizabeth Warren—who has recently overtaken Biden in a number of polls—dictated the terms of the debate. Over the first half of the debate she talked twice as much as Biden, and, somewhat relatedly, was also talked about by everyone else. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg went after her on Medicare for All. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar tried to pick a fight with Warren over the Massachusetts senator’s proposal for a wealth tax. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard twice tried to use her time to get into a one-on-one debate with Warren on foreign policy. California Sen. Kamala Harris tried—for a surprisingly long time—to get Warren to sign onto her letter asking Twitter to delete Trump’s account. (No dice.)
Warren’s public statements and policy proposals were also the impetus for questions that the moderators directed to other candidates—Andrew Yang, for instance, was asked about her position on breaking up tech companies. In a campaign, you make a name for yourself by going after the biggest figure on stage. And for one night at least, there was no bigger figure than Warren.
It was only in the debate’s waning minutes that Biden began to assert himself more forcefully. Asked about the appeal of the populist message of Warren and and Bernie Sanders, Biden insisted that some of his opponents were being too vague—“you’ve got to level with people!”
“I’m the only one on this stage who’s gotten anything really big done,” Biden continued, rattling off a list of legislative accomplishments. “The question is who’s gonna be able to get it done?”
“Who do you think is being vague?” CNN moderator Anderson Cooper asked.
Biden held out his hand toward Warren, and then thought better about it, and added in Sanders, too. “Both of them are being vague on the question of Medicare for All.”
A short while later, when Warren touted her work in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Biden was indignant. “I went on the floor and got you votes,” he said, referring to the law creating the bureau. What did the Warren have to say to that?
“I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law” she began, very pointedly. Biden broke into a huge grin at the omission. He’d been erased from his own administration.

Congress, they argued, should pass legislation codifying the right to an abortion established in Roe v. Wade—a move that could take the matter out of the hands of the Supreme Court and Republican state legislatures altogether.
Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, Julián Castro, and Elizabeth Warren all embraced versions of the idea. Booker, Warren, and Kirsten Gillibrand, who has since exited the race, were among the first to adopt such a plan earlier this year.
Of course, the president wouldn’t be able to do this alone; the idea would almost certainly require Democratic majorities—perhaps large ones—in Congress. Earlier this year, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) introduced such a bill, but it has not advanced in the Democratic-controlled House and would almost certainly be dead-on-arrival in the Republican-majority Senate. A version of this measure was first introduced in 2013.
In arguing for legislation protecting abortion rights, the candidates made clear that the matter is inseparable from issues of economic inequality. “I lived in an America where abortion was illegal, and rich women still got abortions…What we’re talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young,” Warren said. “When you’ve got three out of four Americans supporting [Roe v. Wade], we should be able to get that passed through Congress. We should not leave this to the Supreme Court, we should do it through democracy because we can.”
The issue has grown more urgent over the past year, as a handful of states in the South passed bans on abortion during their spring legislative sessions, and as the president has appointed two Supreme Court justices thought to be hostile to abortion rights. Last week, the court announced it would rule on a case involving a Louisiana law that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital; if allowed to stand, that law would shutter most of the state’s remaining abortion clinics.
Not all of the Democrats on the debate stage won plaudits from abortion rights advocates. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard drew criticism when she expressed support for banning abortion in the third trimester—with exceptions for the health of the woman and the fetus. She repeated Hillary Clinton’s famous line that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare”—a sentiment that many reproductive rights advocates have shied away from in light of the fact that nearly 1 in 4 American women will have had an abortion by age 45. In a survey of the candidates by BuzzFeed News in May, Gabbard did not respond a question about whether or not she supported codifying Roe.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) explained her role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate, she inadvertently touched a nerve with former Vice President Joe Biden.
“I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people, and all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said ‘don’t even try because you will never get it passed,'” Warren said. “We need to get out there and fight for the things that touch people’s lives.”
Seemingly out of the blue, Biden shot back, “I agreed with the great job she did!”
Turning to Warren while jabbing the air with his hand, he said in a raised voice, “I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it! So let’s get those things straight too.”
Warren, at first appearing taken aback, replied (with not a little debate stage shade), “I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.” Both the audience and Biden laughed. She continued, “And I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law, but understand—.”
Biden interrupted, “You did a hell of a job in your job.”
Warren simply replied, “Thank you.”

History Shows Beto Might Be Right.,Kara Voght,MotherJones,Politics,"Midway through Tuesday’s 2020 Democratic debate, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke found himself on the defensive over his plan to implement a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. “Let’s decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and let’s bring this country together in order to do that,” he said in support of his vision, a proposal that goes farther to restrict firearms than anything set forth by his fellow Democratic hopefuls.
South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg swiftly rejected that logic, saying that pushing such a plan could stymie progress toward other gun reforms. “What we owe those survivors is to actually deliver a solution,” Buttigieg said. “On guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban. That would be huge. And we’re going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether it’s ‘Hell yes, we’re going to take your guns’?” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar echoed Buttigieg’s point; California Sen. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, stood firmly by O’Rourke.
The sparring was the inevitable evolution of a disagreement that began been percolating among the Democratic hopefuls during last month’s debate in Michigan. O’Rourke, then just weeks after a deadly rampage in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, declared, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15.” During that last debate, his colleagues gently offered more moderate solutions, voicing support for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, ideas that have become planks of the Democratic platform. In the days that followed, Senate Democrats took sharper jabs at O’Rourke’s proposal: Delaware Sen. Chris Coons told CNN that he thought “that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns.”
Though this marks the first time such a fight has shown itself on a Democratic debate stage, it’s an argument Democrats and gun control advocates have been having among themselves since the 2012 elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. The tragedy had broken the National Rifle Association’s vice-like grip on Congress, and Democratic lawmakers, who had long shied away from guns as a third-rail issue, signaled they would champion reforms. And they set forth on a long road of negotiating with Republicans and gun rights groups to try and pass a modest bill to expand background checks, something gun reformers agreed would do the most to slow the tide of gun deaths.
The measure ultimately failed, and as I wrote last month, some of the veterans of the 2013 negotiations blame their tepid strategy and eagerness to compromise on guns as the reason for its failure. “Nobody who ever got half a loaf asked for half a loaf,” Mark Glaze, who previously served as the executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns—now called Everytown for Gun Safety—told me. “If we really wanted universal background checks, we’d be talking about an assault weapons ban. If we really wanted an assault weapons ban, we would be talking about a constitutional amendment.”

But never one to decline an opportunity to bash his rivals or push a wild conspiracy theory, the president took to Twitter Wednesday morning and linked what he considered lackluster performances to the rationale for Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.

The current impeachment investigation has a very clear, if not overly narrow rationale: It is centered on his efforts to coerce a foreign power into digging political dirt into Democrats. Nevertheless, the president continued to rail against the inquiry Wednesday morning and claim that the economy would tank if any of his Democratic opponents defeated him.

But perhaps what’s most noteworthy about Trump’s post-debate ramblings is what he didn’t say. Tuesday’s debate was the first since the impeachment probe was launched, and therefore the first debate appearance by Joe Biden since becoming one of the central figures in that very investigation. So why isn’t Trump tearing into Biden? Maybe like the rest of the Democratic primary, Trump’s calculus has moved on.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

It’s the sixth veto of Trump’s presidency and comes seven months after he first vetoed a similar measure in March, which had been passed by the Senate in a 59-41 vote, with twelve Republicans siding with Democrats. This bill would have halted the president’s emergency declaration to funnel $3.6 billion in Defense Department funding to build more sections of his wall at the Southern border; the bill the president vetoed last night was nearly identical. “In short, the situation on our southern border remains a national emergency, and our Armed Forces are still needed to help confront it,” Trump wrote in his message to the Senate Tuesday just after 9 p.m., an hour into the Democratic debate. Congress could override the President’s veto with a two-thirds majority of votes in the Senate, but that is unlikely to occur, the New York Times reports.
Building a wall at the southern border has long been a drawn-out battle at the center of Trump’s aggressive and contentious crackdown on immigration reform. And Democrats have fought tooth and nail throughout Trump’s presidency to block his efforts to succeed in that plan, as well as to put a halt to his detention of refugees and his controversial family separation policy.
But during Tuesday’s three-hour Democratic presidential debate, there wasn’t a single question about immigration. Even some of the candidates later expressed disappointment with how this subject, as well as ones on climate change and LBGTQ, were not part of the discussion.

But none of the Democrats owe as much to the idea of impeachment as Tom Steyer. For years, the billionaire activist has bankrolled an attempt to build a grassroots environmental movement with his NextGen advocacy groups. And beginning in 2017, Steyer poured money into Need to Impeach, a pro-impeachment group that was built largely around Steyer’s own image, that included Super Bowl ads featuring Steyer.
On the debate stage, Steyer was eager to talk about that history. “I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,” he said. “Impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They’re the voice that counts, and that’s who I went to, the American people.”
For Steyer, even qualifying for the debate was a challenge. Despite his own enormous personal wealth, DNC rules required him to accumulate at least 130,000 individual donors to make it onto the stage. So how does a billionaire who is self-funding his campaign convince average Americans to send him small donations? As we reported in July, the petition drive that Need to Impeach launched early in the Trump presidency appeared to form the backbone of this effort:
When he announced his run, Steyer said he would separate himself from Need to Impeach’s operations (as well as from NextGen’s). But Steyer did make use of all that information vacuumed up by his earlier political organizations, purchasing or renting the massive email contact lists they had built:
According to federal filings submitted last night, Steyer’s campaign paid Need to Impeach $390,000 to buy or rent computer equipment and email lists. Another $31,000 was spent buying equipment and renting email information from NextGen.
That’s nowhere near Steyer’s biggest expense—he spent about $47 million in all last quarter—but it did help his campaign rake in more than $1.4 million in small donations. And it helped him score a coveted spot in the debate.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

You Probably Missed It.,AJ Vicens,MotherJones,Politics,"Hours before a dozen Democrats vying to be the next president of the United States took the debate stage in Ohio, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a key case involving Puerto Rico. At stake was the unelected fiscal control board set up by Congress in 2016 to oversee the island’s finances and find a way out from under $120 billion in debt. While the case was brought by a hedge fund that argued the board’s appointment was unconstitutional, the debate touched on some of the most important matters facing Puerto Rico, including how its colonial status shapes debt restructuring and the openly racist legal precedents shaping its law.
Ahead of the debate, the Power 4 Puerto Rico coalition launched a website aiming to hold 2020 Democratic candidates to account for their Puerto Rico policies—or lack thereof.
“For too long, presidential candidates of both parties have ignored the light of the people of Puerto Rico,” Federico A. de Jesús, senior advisor to group said in a statement accompanying the site’s launch. “At a time when President Trump has targeted our community with insults and going as far as illegally withholding disaster relief funds duly approved by Congress, merely criticizing Trump will not cut it.”
Despite the coalition’s efforts, and the day’s arguments before the high court, Puerto Rico was once again neglected by the moderators, as it has been through all the 2020 debates.
The island has come up just a handful of times at the events, but only when candidates have gone out of their way to mention it. Julian Castro has done so twice, including during the first debate in June, in response to a question about climate mitigation, and again in July, when he hailed protesters who forced Puerto Rico’s governor from power. In the September debate, Andrew Yang criticized the federal reconstruction efforts on the island, and in last night’s debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren mentioned a visit she made.
While the crowded Democratic debates have limited discussions on a host of subjects, leaving each candidate only a matter of minutes to try and connect with voters, the lack of focus on the island has prevented airing a number of issues critical to the nearly 3 million American citizens who live there, and their many relations elsewhere in the U.S. Along with yesterday’s Supreme Court hearing, and the persistent financial issues, Puerto Rico is the place where millions lived through one of the deadliest natural disasters in US history just two years ago, where local and national corruption recently spurred hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets, and where, just hours before the debate, Gov. Wanda Vázquez called an emergency meeting in response to a mass shooting that left six people dead in an apartment complex, just one of a spate of recent brazen killings.
While Puerto Rico’s voters will participate in a late March Democratic primary, the bulk of delegates selected by voters to pick the party’s nominee will already have been selected. And Puerto Ricans can’t vote in the November 2020 presidential election unless they live on the mainland. It’s not hard to understand why the island’s issues can be pushed aside.
“On the day Puerto Rican advocacy groups called out Democratic candidates for their lack of interest in Puerto Rico, once again I am not surprised that the island gets ignored,” Julio Ricardo Varela, founder of Latino Rebels and co-host of the “In The Thick” political podcast, told Mother Jones. “It’s as if Democrats don’t really care to have an actual debate about colonialism, debt, austerity, and political status.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Matt Bevin has spent the past four years acting like a mini Donald Trump, a politician prone to social media outbursts belittling his ideological opponents in the most bombastic fashion. And just a few weeks out from Election Day, it’s a toss up among voters on whether Bevin deserves a second term.
A new poll from Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy found that voters were evenly between Bevin and his Democratic opponent, current Attorney General Andy Beshear. As the Courier-Journal points out, the poll actually represented a slight improvement for Bevin; his approval among state voters has increased to 45 percent, up from 38 percent when Mason-Dixon last looked at the race in December. (Morning Consult, another polling company, has consistently found that Bevin is the least popular governor in the country.)
As I wrote in our September/October issue, Bevin’s reelection should, in theory, be a cinch. He’s running in a deep-red state where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 30 percent; Republicans hold both US Senate seats, and Democrats represent just one of the state’s six House districts. And Bevin has done everything to cozy up to Trump, with the president returning that love with a re-endorsement tweet on Tuesday.

But Kentucky voters don’t seem to appreciate having a Trump-style governor. As Al Cross, a longtime political reporter in the state, put it to me, “Many Kentuckians see their governor as the personification of the state. And this is a state that often comes in for ridicule. Socioeconomically and demographically, culturally we get looked down on by people on the coast. And often get made fun of. And Kentuckians are sensitive to that. They don’t want their governor to be a jerk. I famously called Matt Bevin an arrogant jerk when he was running in 2015. He is still arrogant from time to time, and he’s still a jerk from time to time. And if it wasn’t for that, he’d be a heavy favorite for reelection.”
And Bevin’s biggest mistake may have been who he has trained most of his ire against: teachers. The governor has spent the past few years picking fights and trading insults with the state’s public school teachers as he crusades to roll back pension benefits. As I reported:
Kentucky is one of three states that holds its gubernatorial election in the odd year ahead of the next presidential campaign. Since there are no national races happening at the same time, that can lead to low turnout, making poll predictions challenging. Four years ago, Bevin’s Democratic opponent consistently posted a small lead, but Bevin came out ahead by nine points. And there has been scant polling of the race, with the election less than three weeks away.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Media
	Politics","But not limited to: It was just a four-word phrase, a bit of plain contractual verbiage, but even now, more than a decade later, Spencer Kuvin has a hard time expressing just how bizarre it was. “It’s incredibly odd language,” said Kuvin, an attorney in Florida. “I’ve never seen it before in a non-prosecution agreement.”
Kuvin and I were talking about the infamous and inexplicable 2007 plea deal offered by then–US Attorney Alexander Acosta, last seen slinking out of the Labor Department’s back door. Kuvin had represented three of Epstein’s victims at the time of the agreement, and Kuvin is still exercised about the deal, in particular its brief immunity clause that continues to protect Epstein’s co-conspirators.
According to a ruling by US District Judge Kenneth Marra in February 2019, “from between about 1999 and 2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor girls…at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, and elsewhere in the United States and overseas.” The ruling goes on to describe a child sex ring: “In addition to his own sexual abuse of the victims, Epstein directed other persons to abuse the girls sexually. Epstein used paid employees to find and bring minor girls to him. Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.”
But back in 2007, Epstein was charged only with procuring an underage girl for prostitution, having struck an unbelievable sweetheart deal with Acosta. Epstein served 13 months in a Palm Beach County jail, of which six days a week were spent on work release in his high-rise office, a limo chauffeuring him to and from jail. He was also required to register as a sex offender.
The deal on its face is incredibly favorable to Epstein. If you look closer, things get even better for him:
The four women named had allegedly helped recruit underage girls for Epstein at his direction. But that four-word phrase “but not limited to” gave a free pass to anybody who would have helped Epstein acquire or traffic underage girls for sex.
How could the government agree to immunize “any potential co-conspirators” of an alleged serial child rapist? The question is at the center of so many conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein’s life and death.
The deal has not expired with Epstein, either. On September 16, Judge Marra shot down efforts by Epstein’s victims to invalidate the non-prosecution agreement, letting the co-conspirator provision stand. (We learned the same day that the federal government had told the court in 2011 that the agreement applied only in Florida, meaning in theory that co-conspirators could be charged in another state.) “There are co-conspirators involved in this whole thing,” Kuvin said. “By leaving it open like this, if they decide to try and file charges against Maxwell or others who were co-conspirators, I have no doubt that her attorneys will try and raise this as an issue, and this might give them immunity. It’s frustrating.”
On July 10, Acosta offered an explanation for the agreement: “The purpose in this case was to bring Epstein to jail, to put him behind bars. And so there were other individuals that may have been involved, in any type of conspiracy there are individuals around someone, the focus really is on the top player. And that’s where our focus appropriately was.”
But a “focus on the top player” doesn’t require freeing from liability the people who aided and abetted him—people who sent girls to Epstein so he could sexually assault them. The immunity clause drastically weakened the government’s case; with those four words, prosecutors lost whatever leverage they might have had to extract evidence from Epstein’s co-conspirators.
Alan Dershowitz, who represented Epstein during the 2007 case, offered me a much different but equally strange explanation for the immunity clause.
“That was designed to protect any women who Epstein had get other women,” said Dershowitz. Another member of the 2007 defense team described the provision as a way to “protect” the dozens of young girls who were victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse but who had also accepted money to recruit other girls, often from high school house parties.
“That is complete and utter crap,” Kuvin said. “Absolutely not true.” Kuvin believed the provision was crafted to protect people like Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and longtime Epstein confidant accused of soliciting girls on the financier’s behalf. “They wrote that provision in to be as broad as possible because he wanted to capture, in that plea deal, all of his direct co-conspirators, like Ghislaine Maxwell,” Kuvin went on. “If they wanted to exclude any girls from prosecution, the government could’ve done that. They interviewed over 40 women, and they knew the names of all those women.”
The logic in Dershowitz’s explanation has several obvious flaws: One, it would seem to encourage perpetrators to victimize people to gain their assistance in a criminal conspiracy. Two, if the objective is to protect the victims of sexual assault, a provision that immunizes people who were involved in trafficking young girls to a child molester seems counterintuitive. And most obviously, while the defense claims this provision protects victims, it ultimately protects their assailant the most. In immunizing any of his potential co-conspirators, it keeps them from possibly flipping or providing evidence.
And to be clear, the government makes no habit out of cutting this sort of deal. Nobody I spoke to in reporting this piece had ever heard of a provision like it, Dershowitz included. When asked if the provision would in fact protect anyone who had helped Epstein acquire girls, Dershowitz answered, “Yes, those who helped him get girls.”
I asked why Acosta would have accepted such a broad provision in the deal. Dershowitz claimed Epstein “wouldn’t have accepted it unless [Acosta] did. That’s how negotiations go.” He also told me the feds had a “very weak case” and that the deal offered to Epstein “was not a sweetheart deal. I’d be happy to tell you if it was because I’d get credit for it.”
“That comment is absurd.” Kuvin said. “You know, what is atrocious is the volume and number of victims he had molested. You’re telling me there’s evidence that you have a serial molester of underage girls and that allowing him one year in a local jail on work release every day is a reasonable deal? That’s absurd. They just didn’t do their jobs—I mean the US attorney’s office, they completely fell asleep at the switch and did not do their job. If they did do their jobs, they would have been able to expand this investigation to New York, New Mexico, potentially Paris, and his island in the US Virgin Islands, and talked to all the girls who are now coming forward and telling their stories of what happened to them. But they didn’t. They just gave up. The US attorney’s office completely gave up on this case because they felt: ‘Oh, it’s just a couple of girls. It’s not a big deal, and this guy’s really rich, and he’s paid all these lawyers to fight us, and it’s just going to cause too much headache.’”
Kuvin battled the government in court for a year and a half just to see a copy of the plea, only becoming aware of it through a tip that came from within the FBI. “A year and a half just to get the fucking deal,” he said. “It was unbelievable.” This was because of yet another baffling provision in the agreement:
This coverup was recently found to be illegal.
“For those who think that perhaps money and power prevailed, and that connections to high-ranking individuals could exercise their influence, it cannot be ruled out,” said Gloria Allred, who is planning to file a lawsuit in New York on behalf of several of Epstein’s victims. “I don’t see a rational basis for it. I’m trying to stretch and think from the prosecutors’ point of view as to why they would accept this kind of deal—such a broad immunity that appears to be agreed to for potential alleged co-conspirators—and I can’t see any reason why they would accept that, or why they would want to cover it up.”
Allred is not one for conspiracy theories, but she said, “There’s a basis for people not to trust the answers that are coming out, saying he committed suicide.” She was referring to the 2007 plea deal. “I think the victims deserve the truth, and right now, they don’t have it.”
She continued, “The prosecution has a lot of explaining to do, and I don’t think they can explain this. There is no good answer—it doesn’t exist, and that’s why you can’t find it. Sometimes not finding the answer is the answer.”

This caper has implicated associates of Giuliani, a former Republican member of Congress, and a pro-Trump political action committee run by Linda McMahon, the World Wrestling Entertainment honcho who was Trump’s first head of the Small Business Administration, and advised by Sean Spicer, the prevaricating Trump press secretary who now sweats it out on Dancing with the Stars. And it’s all about campaign contributions and foreign influence—and the ability of players to hide shady or illegal action.
On Thursday morning, four American citizens were indicted by the feds. The group included Lev Parnas, who was born in Ukraine, and Igor Fruman, who was born in Belarus. Parnas and Fruman have been the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of the Trump-Ukraine scandal. While pursuing a big energy deal in Ukraine, the pair worked with Giuliani, who has said he was their lawyer, to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden. Parnas and Fruman set up meetings for Giuliani with Ukrainian officials, and they pressed Ukrainian officials to launch investigations that could yield derogatory information on Biden and that could unearth proof that in 2016 the Ukrainian government colluded with the Hillary Clinton campaign by leaking information on Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who had been a consultant to the brazenly corrupt Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. This is the sort of dirt that Trump asked Zelensky for in the now-infamous, do-me-a-favor July 25 phone call.
And, oh yeah, Parnas and Fruman were big GOP donors. They were trying to buy influence within Republican circles to advance their political agenda in Ukraine and their own business interests in the United States and abroad. And their effort seemed to have partially paid off—at least until it led to their arrests. Another endeavor—allegedly using money from a Russian national to make illegal donations to GOP candidates in Nevada in order to get a foothold in the legal marijuana business in that state—did not come to fruition, according to the indictment.
The indictment filed by the US attorney in the Southern District of New York charges the pair—and two other men named David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin—with violating campaign finance law by hiding the source of contributions that Parnas and Fruman made to Republican campaigns. But the indictment also tells the story of what appears to be awfully damn close to outright political bribery.
Starting in March 2018, the prosecutors allege, Parnas and Fruman “began attending political fundraising events in connection with federal elections and making substantial contributions to candidates…with the purpose of enhancing their influence in political circles and gaining access to politicians.” The pair, the indictment says, “sought to advance their personal financial interest and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.” And the US attorney charges that they created a shell corporation called Global Energy Producers through which they could make donations—and keep their names out of it.
Their first big donation was a $325,000 contribution in May 2018 to what the indictment calls “Committee-1,” which media reports have identified as the America First Action SuperPAC. This outfit is chaired by McMahon, and Spicer is listed on its website as the group’s “senior adviser and spokesman.” This GOP group is dedicated to raising big bucks to get Trump reelected, and in 2018 it raised and spent millions to support Republican congressional candidates.
About the time Parnas and Fruman made that whopping donation to the America First Action SuperPAC, according to the indictment, they also committed $20,000 to “Congressman-1,” who has been identified by reporters as Pete Sessions, a senior Texas Republican who at the time was in a tough fight to retain his seat. America First Action, by the way, was also committed to helping Sessions. Through that 2018 race, it spent about $3 million to assist him.
To recap: We have two fellows looking to score a big deal in Ukraine and eager to win sway within the ruling Republican Party handing loads of money to Republicans. But the tale gets more interesting than the same-old, same-old influence game. The indictment notes that “at and around the same time” Parnas and Fruman were making their promise to funnel significant money into Sessions’ campaign, Parnas met with Sessions and sought his “assistance in causing the U.S. Government to remove or recall the then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.” Parnas’ efforts to remove Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch “were conducted,” the indictment says, “at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.” As these two wheeler-dealers were trying to land a major energy deal in Ukraine, they were also trying to do the bidding of Ukrainian officials in the United States, using campaign contributions to affect US policy.
The indictment leaves out one highly intriguing fact. At the time Parnas and Fruman were raising money for Sessions and pouring a huge amount into the super-PAC that was helping him and other vulnerable Republicans, the Congress member sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling for Yovanovitch’s removal—the exact thing Parnas and “one or more Ukrainian government officials” wanted. In the note to Pompeo, Sessions said, “I have received notice from close companions that Ambassador Yovanovitch has spoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current administration.” Sessions fired off this letter shortly after meeting with Parnas and Fruman.
Sessions has told reporters that he, not Parnas and Fruman, raised the issue of Yovanovitch during their meeting: “I sought their input.” He has denied he pushed for Yonavitch’s removal at their behest. But Sessions’ this-was-my-idea claim is contradicted by the US attorney—that is, the Department of Justice—for the indictment clearly states that when Parnas met with Sessions he requested Session’s help in forcing Yovanovitch out of Ukraine. (And Yovanovitch was recalled and sidelined the following year.)
This is how it looks: Two Giuliani cronies promised money to Sessions and asked him to lean on Pompeo to give Yovanovitch the boot; the wheel was probably also greased by the $325,000 donation to the super-PAC that was backing the congressman; and Sessions did what was asked. Kelly Sadler, a spokesperson for America First Action, told the Daily Beast that there was no agreement that the money from Parnas and Fruman’s company would be used to support Sessions. But it’s no secret that independent-expenditure PACs often informally tell donors how their money will be used and are mindful of which candidates a donor wants to support. Proving these nods and winks can be difficult for prosecutors and reporters. But certainly Parnas and Fruman could point to that big-money contribution to McMahon and Spicer’s super PAC as a donation that could be of great benefit to Sessions.
Unfortunately for Paranas, Fruman, and their so-far unnamed Ukrainian confederates, Sessions lost that race in 2018 to Democrat Colin Allred. Just last week—good timing!—Sessions announced he is now running for a House seat in a neighboring district where the GOP incumbent is retiring. Sessions could not be reached for comment. Earlier this week, he told a local television channel, “They did come by my office and I did meet them and I did meet them off the Hill and they did become contributors. That is not unusual for you to meet people who then become contributors.”
So if you want to talk about corruption, here’s a great case: secret donations to Republicans made to advance the interest of a Ukrainian official by sketchy businessmen linked to an overseas dirt-gathering operation. And it sure seemed to work. Campaign cash was delivered; a letter was written. Rather than fretting about corruption in Kiev, Giuliani and Trump ought to focus on what goes on within their very own swamp.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Ask an Alaskan.,Maddie Stone,MotherJones,Environment,"This story was originally published by Grist and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.
Adrienne Titus was heading back to her parents’ village on a sweltering afternoon in early July when she saw the dead salmon. She had been fishing upstream with her mother on the banks of the gorgeous Unalakleet River, which Chinook, pink, coho, and chum salmon travel up every year in order to spawn. Down closer to the village of Unalakleet, though, there were no signs of life on the water that day—just hundreds of soft bodies floating belly up.
Titus, a 39-year-old Iñupiat woman who lives in Fairbanks but grew up in Unalakleet, had never seen anything like it before. Neither had her mother, or any of the village elders that they asked in this small fishing community on the shores of the Norton Sound in the central Bering Sea.
“It was scary,” Titus said. “It put fear into us.”
Similar reports of dead pink salmon came in all across the Norton Sound that week as temperatures soared into the high 80s and low 90s during a statewide heatwave that “re-wrote the record books,” according to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. Fisheries biologists say that’s no coincidence: Warm water stresses the animals out, and temperatures above a certain threshold can kill them. In a statement issued on July 11, the Norton Sound Economic Development Corporation warned that the salmon die-offs appeared to be part of a “larger ecosystem-level shift” taking place due to rising temperatures.

It’s just one of countless alarming signs of change Alaskans have experienced lately. July was Alaska’s hottest month in recorded history, thanks in part to that torrid heat wave. March through August? The state’s warmest six-month period, with temperatures hovering 6.4 degrees F above long-term averages. From vanished sea ice to skies choked with wildfire smoke to animals appearing where they shouldn’t or not appearing where they should, the impacts of a fast-warming climate were visible everywhere residents looked.
“I have just felt overwhelmed trying to keep up with everything this year,” said Rick Thoman, a climate scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy who co-authored a report in August summarizing the environmental changes unfolding across the state. “It’s been running from one fire to another, almost literally.”
Anne Jensen, an archaeologist who lives in Utqiaġvik, a city of 4,400 on the northern tip of Alaska’s North Slope, said that the loss of sea ice is being felt especially hard by her community. There, Iñupiat hunters hold a subsistence whaling season in the spring and the fall, catching a small number of whales each year that represent both a key source of food and an important cultural tradition.
In the spring, hunters set up camps on the ice where they butcher the animals they catch. But with temperatures in Utqiaġvik rising at some of the fastest recorded rates on Earth, the so-called landfast ice is breaking up earlier in the spring, reducing the amount of time it can be used for hunting. The ice that’s present is becoming weaker and more dangerous.
Fall hunting season occurs over open water before the ice freezes to the shore. But while in the past, the edge of the sea ice might linger 100 miles from the coast around its yearly September minimum, last month the ice bottomed out at its second-lowest ice minimum on record. As of last week, you’d have to travel about 400 miles north of Utqiagvik to find any, said Mark Serreze, a scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center. “This is part of the pattern we’re seeing now,” Serreze said.
The longer open water season is allowing the winds to stir up bigger waves, which can create additional hazards for hunters. Some hunters are also reporting that they have to travel farther from shore to find whales in the fall due to increased shipping activity as the ice disappears.
The food supply isn’t all that’s being affected by the loss of ice: So is the very land people’s houses sit on. Across the North Slope, shorelines are eroding as warm ocean waters gnaw away at thawing permafrost bluffs. In addition to impacting modern-day infrastructure, this is causing many of the coastal archaeological sites Jensen studies to deteriorate rapidly.
“It’s pretty scary,” Jensen said. “The changes are major and happening quickly.”
Further south in the Bering Sea, the ice broke up early this spring after struggling to grow throughout the winter. By mid-May, it was nearly gone. The dearth of sea ice, which would have been unprecedented if something very similar hadn’t occurred in 2018, is affecting the so-called “cold pool,” a vast region of near-freezing water that develops at the bottom of the Bering as sea ice forms above, providing a habitat for species like Arctic cod and snow crabs.

Last year, for the first time on record, the cold pool didn’t form, and scientists saw large numbers of southern species, like pollock and Pacific cod, move into areas of the northern Bering Sea “where we really never expected to see them,” according to Lyle Britt, who heads up the Bering Sea Bottom Trawl Survey Group at NOAA Fisheries. This year, a cold pool did form but it was “effectively so small that it was really not a barrier to fish movement,” Britt said. Once again, large numbers of fish from more southern latitudes appear to be invading the region.
What this will ultimately mean for the fisheries of the Bering is unclear. But this year was a dismal one for crabbers in the Norton Sound, who caught only a little more than half of their annual quota, which was already the lowest the state had set in 20 years. Poor ice conditions were at least partly responsible for the bad haul, according to Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game.
“It’s definitely been alarming to the crab harvesters noticing the changing conditions in the Bering,” said Jamie Goen, executive director of Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers, a trade organization that represents crabbers further south. Their members have been catching their quotas, Goen said, but as is the case up north, the quotas are at historic lows.
Inland, Alaskans have been contending with wildfires. Fires torched some 2.6 million acres across the state this year, and although that’s far from Alaska’s worst wildfire season—in 2004, a staggering 6.5 million acres burned statewide—2019 will go down as one of the ten largest wildfire years since 1940. Big years like it are occurring far more often than they used to.
With this summer’s fires came loads of smoke. In early July, residents of Anchorage experienced their first-ever dense smoke advisory as particulate matter from the Swan Lake Fire, a lightning-sparked blaze on the Kenai Peninsula, wafted over the city. Around the same time, lighting-sparked fires in central Alaska sent smoke billowing over Fairbanks, reducing visibility to a few feet and creating some of the worst air quality in the world.
Alaskans also experienced some dangerous late season flare-ups this year, fueled by hot, dry conditions that prompted the state to extend fire seasonfrom the end of August to late September. These included the McKinley Fire, which exploded in size north of Anchorage on August 17 and destroyed more than 100 buildings before it was contained. That very same day, the Swan Lake Fire got a second life when gusty conditions reignited the flames. It would grow to engulf an additional 50,000 acres over the next week, triggering a new wave of smoke advisories.
Fires like these are “unusual” in mid August, said John Morris, a retired park ranger with the National Park Service who’s lived in Alaska since the 1960s. Their appearance this year illustrates what Morris sees as the most striking consequence of climate change in Alaska: just how unpredictable the weather has become.
“In some ways, it’s comforting, because things are warmer than they used to be,” Morris said. “But not having the environment be as predictable makes things a lot more uncertain.”
To Rosa Standifer, a 46-year-old Athabascan woman born and raised in the village of Tyonek southwest of Anchorage, the clearest sign that things have changed is in the salmon. Since Standifer moved back to Alaska from California in the mid-2000s, Chinook salmon have declined precipitously in the Cook Inlet, where Tyonek is located.
“Back in the day, our boats would be sunk down with salmon,” Standifer said, recalling her childhood summers spent fishing on the water with her father. “Now you’re just praying and hoping you get some.”
Sue Mauger, science director for the community-based non-profit Cook Inletkeeper, thinks climate change is at least partly to blame. Chinook, she said, become stressed out when temperatures rise above 55 degrees F, leaving them more susceptible to pollution, predation, and disease. Her research shows that summer temperatures in the non-glacial streams feeding Cook Inlet have risen steadily for decades. During the July heat wave this summer, one of the major salmon streams Mauger monitors hit 81.7 degrees F — a frightening new record. “I like to think of this as the frog in the pot of water has been simmering for a few decades, and we just had a big twitch,” Mauger said.
Asked whether she ever experienced a summer like 2019 growing up, Standifer laughed. “Oh, no,” she said. “And I hope it don’t keep getting that hot. I moved back to be cold.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The majority of the 2020 Democratic hopefuls have called for reforms to strengthen union power. Twelve of the Democratic candidates support a Green New Deal, a vision for creating federally backed green jobs. Under a Sanders or Warren administration, four-year public college would be free; community college would be free, regardless of which 2020 hopeful won.
But, pray tell, while Americans are heading back to school or to their unionized jobs, who is going to watch their kids?
It’s a question many of the 2020 hopefuls haven’t made much of a point to answer. So far, only Sen. Elizabeth Warren has put out a full vision for how she’d tackle the issue, with all of the other remaining candidates only discussing the topic in broad strokes. Katie Hamm, vice president of early childhood education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, calls the lack of detailed plans a missed opportunity for candidates to talk about how caring for children fits into their vision for progressive economic reform.
“To have a conversation about the economy and not talk about child care seems like a huge oversight to me,” Hamm says. “It’s not just a budget issue for families—economists have been pretty clear about the fact that our economy could be larger if we had more child care and more parents could enter the workforce.”
Months before Elizabeth Warren was crowned the candidate with “a plan for that,” she was the candidate with precisely one plan: A universal child care proposal that would guarantee care to every child from birth until they start school, all costing no more than 7 percent of their family’s income. This was Warren’s opening bid, the foundation laid for a ceaseless fount of policy proposals that built a case for how decades of government divestment and business-friendly reforms have benefited the wealthy few over the working many.
Warren couched her plan in terms of economic productivity, citing how parents could work more hours and that the nation’s more than 1 million child care workers—paid a higher wage under her vision—would have more money to spend. But she also made a personal appeal that’s become a fixture of her stump speech: Warren almost quit her job as a law professor due to a lack of reliable child care options for her two then-young children, saved only by the fact that her Aunt Bee moved in to help. “Finding affordable and high-quality child care has gotten even harder since my children were growing up—and not everyone is lucky enough to have an Aunt Bee of their own,” Warren noted in a blog post announcing her plan back in February.
Back then, I predicted that she’d effectively thrown down the gauntlet for her fellow 2020 hopefuls. Even if they didn’t accept her precise vision, the existence of such a proposal might pressure other candidates into offering their own specific, aggressive proposals to combat the federal government’s lackluster investment in child care. There was good reason to suspect that would be so: Women, to whom the responsibilities of child care often chiefly fall, had done heroes’ work on behalf of Democratic candidates during the 2018 midterms, by running, donating, and organizing at a scale not seen in recent history.
But that hasn’t really happened. Of the 12 candidates who will be on the debate stage on Tuesday night, only Warren has articulated a precise vision. Others, such as Julián Castro and Bernie Sanders, have voiced support for universal care but have yet to offer details about what their own plans would entail. Meanwhile, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Amy Klobuchar have said they’d support implementing Sen. Patty Murray’s (D-Wash.) bill—which mirrors much of Warren’s plan, but phases out the cap for higher-income families.
That lack of detail hasn’t necessarily hurt candidates, nor has it seemed to help: New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand had staked her 2020 run on the issues facing working women, affordable child care chief among them. But she struggled to gain traction and was one of the first Democratic hopefuls to exit the race.
This isn’t to say Democratic candidates aren’t interested in helping working parents address the hurdles of caring for children. Paid family leave has gained traction on the 2020 trail: Harris’ “children’s agenda” proposes six months of paid leave for parents to spend with their newborns, something aimed at providing economic justice for working parents. Nearly all the 2020 Democrats have voiced support for various flavors of universal pre-K for 3- or 4-year-olds. But while all of those are important pieces of the puzzles, they’re not “anywhere close to a child care solution,” CAP’s Hamm tells me. Most notably, many have not articulated what should happen in the two- or three-year span when paid family leaves ends and universal pre-K begins.
According to a recent report from the Center for American Progress, families pay an average of $10,000 per year for full-time care, something that amounts to roughly one-fifth of a median household’s income in the US. In more than half of all states, a year’s worth of child care costs more on average than in-state tuition at that state’s public four-year colleges, a sum approaching the average annual salary of the 20- and 30-somethings who are parents. That burden often falls to women and is even harder for women of color, who are overrepresented in low-wage jobs that are accompanied by unpredictable, nontraditional work schedules. A recent study from the Council for a Strong America estimated that the US economy loses $57 billion a year in revenue, wages, and productivity as a result of child care shortages.
More child care proposals are in the works. Beto O’Rourke’s and Buttigieg’s campaigns tell me they plan to roll out comprehensive plans shortly. Harris’ Senate office confirmed that she’s working on a bill to address some of the gaps in care families face during summer vacations and the misaligned start and end time of schooldays and work days. If past is prologue, we’ll be waiting awhile to see the full scope of what the candidates have to offer: Hillary Clinton didn’t release her child care proposal until May 2016, only two months before the end of the Democratic primary.
But even if candidates do offer clearer visions, don’t expect to hear about them at this week’s debate: So far, only passing seconds of the past five Democratic debates have lingered on child care policy. The only hefty mention came from Gillibrand, who, before she departed the race, called out former Vice President Joe Biden for a 1981 op-ed in which he bemoaned day care centers as “monuments to our growing unwillingness to accept personal responsibility.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Fiona Hill, who resigned from her post just days before the now-infamous July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, will reportedly tell lawmakers that Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland pursued a Ukrainian policy inconsistent with normal National Security Council procedures.
Follow along below.
8:37 p.m. ET: The Washington Post has a good profile of Gordon Sondland, the venal, grasping Portland hotelier–turned–US ambassador to the European Union. Once upon a time Sondlannd pretended to be disgusted by Trump’s treatment of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, only to change his tune after the election.
And what for?
8:26 p.m. ET: Hill is still reportedly testifying.

7:53 p.m. ET: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s former senior adviser, Michael McKinley, will testify on Wednesday in a closed session in the impeachment inquiry, CNN and Washington Post reported on Monday. McKinley resigned from his post last week.

7:02 p.m. ET: Federal prosecutors in New York are looking into Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s business dealings in Ukraine and bank records as part of an investigation into “Mr. Giuliani’s role in an alleged conspiracy involving two of his business associates,” sources told the Wall Street Journal on Monday. Those associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were indicted on campaign-finance charges last week.

2:00 p.m. ET: On Sunday, Hunter Biden announced that he’ll resign at the end of the month from the board of a Chinese private equity company. Biden also said that he would not serve on any foreign boards if his father becomes president. Trump, unsurprisingly, is twisting the announcement:

11:00 a.m. ET: Rep. Matt Gaetz, making things weird:


9:50 a.m. ET: If you missed over the weekend, House Intelligence chairman Rep. Adam Schiff signaled on Sunday that the whistleblower whose complaint triggered impeachment proceedings may not testify anymore, citing the individual’s safety. Trump has repeatedly attacked the whistleblower and demanded the opportunity to meet his “accuser” face to face.

9:30 a.m. ET: Hill has arrived.

On Sunday President Trump talks to the Turkish president and tells him to go ahead and invade northern Syria. He is then informed that our allies the Kurds occupy this territory and will be in big trouble if the Turks roll across the border. Trump doesn’t care. He follows up this warning with a tweetstorm that basically boils down to, who cares about the Kurds anyway? Then he withdraws all US troops. Any ten-year-old could predict that this would be viewed by the Turks as a green light to do whatever they wanted, and that’s exactly what happened: the Turks began massacring Kurds and eventually the Kurds teamed up with the Russians in an act of self-preservation. Now, having made a colossal mess out of everything, Trump plans to sanction the Turks and broker a cease-fire. You betcha.
And this happened in the span of a week!
It’s easy to pretend that a president doesn’t really need to know much. After all, that’s what aides are for. But it’s really not true. Everyone makes mistakes, as Obama did when he talked about a “red line” in Syria. But Trump’s unfathomable ignorance and bloated ego is light years beyond that.

Hill, who was formerly Trump’s top Russia adviser, told lawmakers that Bolton eventually became so disturbed with the back-channel policymaking that he instructed her to notify White House lawyers.
“Giuliani’s a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up,” Hill quoted Bolton, the infamous warmonger, telling her one day.
That colorful description is apparently not sitting well with Giuliani. The two men are now engaging in a name-calling war of words over who is more destructive:


It’s a tough choice. But between Bolton, who historically believed that war is the answer to every international squabble, and Giuliani, the president’s unhinged personal lawyer who is reportedly now under investigation in connection to the Ukraine scandal, we’ll give a momentary victory to the person who has suddenly emerged as a potential key witness in Democrats’ push to bring down Donald Trump.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Defense Secretary Mark Esper lambasted the incursion as “unnecessary and impulsive,” adding that the “relationship between our two countries has…been damaged.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Turkey was not “acting as a good NATO ally.” President Donald Trump—who is facing a fierce backlash from congressional Republicans after originally green-lighting the invasion—slapped sanctions on Turkish leaders Monday.
But the folks running the US Army’s official Twitter account must not have gotten the message.
On Monday night, the Army tweeted out a news story from September that described a NATO training operation in Germany involving the United States and more than a dozen partner countries, including Turkey. The tweet specifically singled out “Turkish commandos,” who, it noted, had “joined American and Italian paratroopers during…an airborne assault that was a part of the training exercise. The tweet included the hashtag “#Partnership” but offered no context related to the escalating violence in Syria that threw a wrench in that alliance last week. The Army did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the tweet.
The Army’s apparent praise for Turkey did not go unnoticed among reporters and military experts online.
“A lot can change in three weeks,” wrote Erik Slavin, Europe and Middle East bureau chief for Stars and Stripes. “Timeliness, Army.”
“Related content is not always a good idea you guys,” wrote Abbie Bennett, national reporter for Connecting Vets.

Second, he’s not a Trump man. His joke about the “drug deal” shows his disdain for the Trump inner circle, who he considers little better than dilettantes looking for a big score.

This latest drip came from Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).

The Trump administration appears to have been holding two things over the head of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, as it demanded investigations into both the Bidens and the origins of the FBI’s Russia investigation. One was military aid, which Trump held up until late summer. The other was a potential face-to-face meeting between Trump and Zelensky, something the new Ukrainian government seemed to want badly in order to showcase its close relationship with the United States.
Sondland became a central figure in the scandal when text messages turned over to Congress showed him discussing relations with Ukraine, including efforts to get the Ukrainians to pursue politically motivated investigations in exchange for favors from Washington. In one exchange, diplomat Bill Taylor texted, “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.” After speaking with Trump, Sondland responded that Trump had made clear that there were “no quid pro quo’s of any kind.” According to Hill’s testimony, Sondland may have known that wasn’t true.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The coroner’s report on blogging goes something like this: After disrupting everything and changing the world forever, blogs were professionalized and incorporated into publishing outlets, and the things that defined them—voice, analysis, obsessiveness—became standard for writing on the internet. Blogs won, and died. The epistolary back-and-forth of blogging moved largely to social media, and by the time Mother Jones removed most of our blogs from our site in 2016, they really were basically just a vestigial button in our CMS.
But tellingly, we actually didn’t get rid of all of them.

The way we interact with our readers, the way we interact with each other, the way we want to cover the news, has all evolved.

It will be a place where the various developments of the day are conveyed, discussed, analyzed, raged at, and laughed about by reporters and editors.

Immigrant Rights Groups Aren’t Having It.,Nuria Marquez Martinez,MotherJones,Immigration,"A coalition of 28 immigrant rights groups sent a blistering letter Tuesday to members of the Senate judiciary committee to criticize federal judge nominee Steven Menashi’s “disturbing and long track record” of shaping and implementing harsh anti-immigrant policies during his time in the White House. Specifically, the group pointed to Menashi’s work with Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s immigration hawk senior adviser, on policies like “Remain in Mexico,” the recent public charge rule, and more while serving as associate White House counsel.

“Mr. Menashi has worked to erode critical rights and legal protections while serving in the White House Counsel’s office advising on the administration’s inhumane and cruel anti-immigrant measures,” they wrote.
On Thursday, the judiciary committee is expected to vote on Menashi’s controversial nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which oversees six districts in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont. During a hearing before the committee earlier this month, Menashi refused to specify exactly what role he played in shaping those policies, stating only that he “provided legal advice” on many of the administration’s plans.

Menashi also refused to answer questions during his hearing about his time in the White House, angering Democrats and Republicans alike. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) appeared particularly frustrated during his questioning of Menashi; when Menashi asked if Kennedy had any follow-ups after repeatedly dodging the senator’s questions, Kennedy replied, “I’m out of time. You took up a lot of it by not answering my questions.”
Meanwhile, Menashi has also ignored questions from Democrats like California Sen. Dianne Feinstein about his knowledge of Trump’s July 25 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They gave him until October 7 to respond, but he never did.
“Steven Menashi has left questions unanswered about his work at the White House, including his involvement in the White House’s response to the whistleblower complaint,” Feinstein told HuffPost at the time. “Mr. Menashi is seeking a lifetime appointment to the court, so his record must be thoroughly examined. The committee shouldn’t vote on his nomination without all of the facts. He must stop evading our questions.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Since her acclaimed and controversial sophomore album El Mal Querer dropped in November 2018, the 26-year-old artist, whose full name is Rosalía Vila Tobella, has skyrocketed out of the Spanish underground into full-fledged pop stardom in less than a year. When the 2019 Latin Grammy nominations were announced in late September, she was among this year’s top nominees.
Just a month earlier, Rosalía became the first Catalan artist in MTV’s Video Music Award history to win multiple awards, snatching trophies for Best Choreography and Best Latin video for her hit “Con Altura.” “I come from Barcelona,” Rosalía said while accepting the VMA for Best Latin video. “I’m so happy to be here…representing my culture.”

That acceptance speech earned Rosalía a strong side-eye from some viewers. As Afro-Dominican journalist Jennifer Mota put it: “What part of ‘Con Altura’ was Rosalía’s culture, exactly?”
“Con Altura” is a reggaeton banger featuring Colombian superstar J Balvin and Spanish producer Pablo “El Guincho” Díaz-Reixa. The song showcases Rosalía’s beautiful, airy voice and distinct Spanish pronunciations over a classic Dembow beat—a rhythm that originated in Jamaica and then made its way throughout the African diaspora to places like Panama, New York City, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. Dembow is the foundation of reggaeton, a genre of music created in large part by Afro-Latinx people.
While Rosalía’s wildly popular song draws heavily from Afro-Caribbean music traditions, the artist herself has no Latin American heritage—a fact that has sparked cries of cultural appropriation from many Latinx fans. Since the artist’s catapult into the upper-crust of Latin music over the past year, a debate about race, class, privilege, and who gets to be considered Latinx has followed close behind.

At times, Rosalía seems oblivious to these critiques. In January, the singer sat down for Billboard’s Growing Up Latino series and claimed to “feel Latina” when visiting Panama and Mexico. In August, she graced the cover of Vogue Mexico for an issue meant to highlight “20 Latino Artists making the world dance.”
Rosalía first heard the term con altura, which roughly translates to “doing something with style or elegance,” while searching for samples on YouTube. She stumbled upon a clip from the Dominican TV show Sábado Extraordinario in which Dominican radio host, Mariachi Budda, utters the phrase. Rosalía and her producers loved it so much they ripped Budda’s voice from the clip and placed it at the top of the song (Budda is credited as one of the song’s writers). “Con Altura,” which debuted in March, has since become Rosalía’s biggest commercial hit. It’s her most streamed song on Spotify, most-watched video on YouTube (with almost 1 billion views), and it earned her a Latin Grammy nod for Best Urban Song, securing her spot as this year’s most-nominated woman.

The song also marks a shift in Rosalía’s sound, moving her away from the stylized flamenco pop that characterized El Mal Querer toward more Caribbean sounds. That she’d be drawn to “Urbano” music isn’t completely surprising: While reggaeton had been frowned upon for years, deemed lower-class and even dangerous when it was still very black, the genre is now mainstream, lucrative, and a whole lot whiter. As Rosalía moves to embrace the genre’s newfound popularity, Mota says, “I think she has a social responsibility to analyze how much space she’s taking up in a black-rooted genre.”
Petra Rivera-Rideau, an assistant professor of American Studies at Wellesley College and author of Remixing Reggaeton: The Cultural Politics of Race in Puerto Rico, says Rosalía’s ascendance within the Latin mainstream follows a well-established precedent. “Of course, this is not unique to the Latin music industry, but there’s a pattern in Latin music where the industry promotes artists that are white even if the musical practices that they’re performing are rooted in black communities,” Rivera-Rideau says. “The people who are getting promoted to be at the higher echelons of these media industries, like popular music, tend to be Latinos who embody a kind of whiteness. It’s a distinct whiteness from the US. It’s not this idea of a pure whiteness, but it’s a mestizo whiteness.”
Rivera-Rideau says this “mestizo whiteness” is something media scholars dub the “Latin Look”: Someone with a light complexion, European features, and dark, wavy hair who could be mixed race, but not obviously black or indigenous. Someone who looks a lot like Rosalía or Enrique Iglesias or Alejandro Sanz—other Spanish artists who have also been mislabeled as Latinx.
It isn’t just their phenotype that makes Spanish artists profitable for Latin music companies. It’s also about the class position they enjoy by nature of being from a European country. While a Puerto Rican artist like Daddy Yankee might embody the Latin Look, Rivera-Rideau explains, he is still marked by a specific “urban mythology.” “He was still from the caserio (public housing). He has this whole story of getting shot in the leg,” Rivera-Rideau says. “As reggaeton moves forward and pushes into the pop mainstream, you have these sorts of more respectable kind of people performing this music. People who are seen as more safe.”
One of the reasons the media continues to misidentify Spanish artists as Latinx is that the language used to name people with Latin American roots has always been fraught. Cristina Mora, a sociology professor at University of California–Berkeley and the author of Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Constructed a New American, says that it took at least 15 years for Latinx communities to establish one pan-ethnic term they could use on the United States Census.
“This is a long struggle,” Mora says. “In the 1960s, [community leaders] were being flown into these big [Census] meetings of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in Washington to discuss the issue and everybody started fighting. Puerto Ricans started accusing Mexicans of wanting to take over, and both of these groups were saying that Cubans were of a different race.” Mora says some people preferred “brown,” while others argued that brown would include non-Latin American people. Others liked Latino, short for Latino Americano, while some thought it sounded too foreign. The group eventually settled upon Hispanic, a contentious compromise that grouped different communities from Latin America together around their most commonly shared language, Spanish, which also inadvertently grouped them together with their former colonizer, Spain.
Univision then began using the term on-air, hoping its Spanish-speaking audience would begin identifying as Hispanics so as to establish a “Hispanic buying power,” a term they could then use to sell ad space. The TV station and marketing companies began to attach certain symbols and images to who a Hispanic (and by extension Latino) person was. According to Mora’s research, that person was almost always non-Black, non-Caribbean, and Spanish speaking. This consistent centering of white and mestizx Latinx people helped to entrench stereotypical images of what we think of when we think of a Latinx person. These rigid stereotypes allow Spanish people to slip easily in and out of the identity in ways many black and indigenous Latinx folks cannot, by virtue of their race.
Mora sees the media’s tendency to call Spanish celebrities Latinx as no accident, given the large profit music companies and artists stand to make by appealing to Latinx consumers: According to analytics firm Nielsen, “Hispanic” buying power is expected to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2021. Mora also highlights that this pre-dates Rosalía: “Antonio Banderas, Penélope Cruz, Julio Iglesias—all of these are examples of turning to Spain to speak for Latinidad in a way that obscures the real historical impact of colonization, genocide, indigeneity, and Afro-Latino ancestry,” Mora says.
And while Latinx folks have always seen colonization as a clear distinguishing factor that links them to each other and separates themselves from Spain, Mora says their Spanish-speaking colonizer has always been in the background. “In many ways, the boundaries of who Latinos were have always included a funny connection to Spain,” Mora says. “Sometimes it was very straightforward and paternalistic like ‘we are Latinos because we all stem from the motherland, from La Madre Patria.'”

Even if Rosalía isn’t technically Latinx, by being positioned as the “it girl” of reggaeton music, she ultimately benefits from the same racial privilege many lighter-skinned Latinx people reap daily, often at the expense of their black and indigenous Latinx counterparts. “How is it that our culture allows for someone like her to be included, but Latinx folks who have a lived black or indigenous experience could never get centered?” wonders Janel Martinez, a Garifuna journalist and founder of the media site Ain’t I Latina?.
But it’s easy for Latinx people to police Latinidad when it comes to Rosalía. It’s easy to point at a Spaniard and shout “colonizer.” It’s much harder, though, for non-black and non-indigenous Latinx folks to channel that energy inward and analyze how we benefit from the same racial privilege Rosalía does. “[The Latinx people] who are policing Latinidad tend to be the ones that are centered regardless,” Martinez says. “Look at the Urbano and reggaeton movement. It now consistently centers those who are racialized as white.”
Reggaeton artists J Balvin, Maluma, Karol G, and Becky G all profit from and take up space in a genre that wouldn’t have been possible without black people. “People get caught up in this monolithic ‘We are all the same’ narrative,” Martinez says. “Those that are white or mestizo/mestiza Latinxs have a hard time pointing the finger at themselves because they don’t want to be found guilty of the things they perpetuate daily.”
The reluctance of white and mestizx Latinx folks to critically analyze how we benefit from colonial social hierarchies that continue to organize our lives today is part of the reason why many black and indigenous millennials of Latin American descent are no longer identifying as Latinx. Some of them are calling for the dismantling of Latinidad all together by circulating the hashtag #LatinidadIsCancelled. “This conversation revolving around Rosalía spawns from our generation unpacking and critically analyzing the terms we’re using when identifying ourselves, our culture, and our ethnic backgrounds,” Mota says, “which is linked to the music that it’s rooted in.”

In a story for The Fader in May, Rosalía offered up a vague response to concerns that she’s a Latinx culture vulture. “If Latin music is music made in Spanish, then my music is part of Latin music,” she said. “But I do know that if I say I’m a Latina artist, that’s not correct, is it? I’m part of a generation that’s making music in Spanish. So, I don’t know—in that sense, I’d prefer for others to decide if I’m included in that, no?”
It’s unclear why someone so proud of her Barcelona heritage won’t publicly state that she isn’t Latina. It’s entirely possible that as a young Catalan artist, she’s struggling to make sense of herself when confronting US notions of identity while simultaneously navigating an industry that has never carved out a specific lane for people like her. It’s also possible that after years of witnessing Spanish artists before her reap the ample material benefits that come along with feigning Latinidad, Rosalía wants her very own silver ticket to Potosí: Not just the top spot in the Latin music world but in the coveted US mainstream as well. Rosalía didn’t return my request for an interview for this story.
What is clear to Mota, however, is that if Rosalía wants to continue to make reggaeton music, she should, at the very least, do a better job acting as an ally for Afro-Latinx people. “Rosalía should be collaborating with black artists, with negras,” Mota says. “If you want to embrace reggaeton, embrace it with negras that are in the industry who don’t have the privilege to navigate certain spaces.”

Indigenous Peoples Day Is the Future.,Delilah Friedler,MotherJones,Politics,"“In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue”—and in 2019, a growing number of US cities and states are recognizing that the cutesy rhyme we learned in school, and the federal holiday named in the explorer’s honor, belies a dark history.
Indigenous people have long resented the holiday, as Columbus’s arrival was the first step in their unfathomable genocide. He and his men enslaved and massacred the indigenous Taíno people, who numbered in the millions upon Columbus’s arrival, and saw their population reduced by as much as 85 percent within a few decades. The brutal colonization of two continents ensued.
The federal holiday, which is always the second Monday in October, plus a bevy of statues and municipal names, continue to glorify Columbus. Yet in recent years, a re-evaluation of history has prompted many state and local governments to distance themselves from his legacy.
South Dakota was the first to ax Columbus Day, replacing it with “Native American Day” in 1989. Two California cities, Berkeley and Santa Cruz, soon followed suit, renaming the second Monday in October as “Indigenous Peoples Day.”
Recently, this exploded into nationwide trend. Since 2014, about 100 cities have started observing Indigenous Peoples Day, usually in place of Columbus Day (a few cities celebrate both). Several states are now on board: Alaska and Oregon enacted the holiday in 2017, and this year, Vermont, Maine, New Mexico, and Michigan, as well as Washington, DC, joined them. Hawaiians observe “Discovers’ Day,” which commemorates not Columbus but the indigenous Polynesians who first discovered their islands. In many places, the Indigenous Peoples Day involves parades, ceremonies, and other displays of Native cultures.
Statues and other representations of Columbus are also coming down. The University of Notre Dame announced earlier this year that it would be covering twelve murals depicting the explorer’s early contact in the Americas; the university president called the art “blind to the consequences of Columbus’ voyage.” (Seventy-nine percent of college students across the US support replacing the holiday.) Last year, San Jose, California voted to take down its Columbus statue, and even Columbus, Ohio—the largest of many cities named for the colonist—stopped observing Columbus Day, though it does not yet celebrate Indigenous people instead.
Some Natives point out that celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day isn’t enough. Critics point out that symbolic displays of apology and reconciliation do not put an end to the racism, land grabs, and resource theft that Indigenous people continue to face.
Yet as Confederate statues are pulled down and buildings named for slaveholders get rechristened, it’s hard to deny that at least some Americans are waking up to the truth about their history, and that’s better than staying asleep.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg excoriated President Donald Trump and his administration Sunday morning for the decision to withdraw the remaining  US troops out of northern Syria in the coming weeks. On CNN’s State of the Union with Jake Tapper, Buttigieg said, “This isn’t even a strategy or a policy—it is the president systematically destroying American alliances and American values and that makes America worse off.”

Buttigieg is speaking from experience on the ground. He’s a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan as a Navy intelligence officer and has openly criticized Trump for avoiding service in the Vietnam War. “This is somebody who, I think it’s fairly obvious to most of us, took advantage of the fact that he was the child of a multimillionaire in order to pretend to be disabled so that somebody could go to war in his place,” he said, according to NBC News.
Now, Turkey has launched a military offensive against neighboring Syria just days after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke with Trump on a call that has been described by officials as including “various diplomatic exchanges.” In the call, Trump reportedly made a spur-of-the-moment decision to pull out of Turkey, which surprised his advisers.
The situation in Syria has deteriorated steadily since that call. Brett McGurk, who has served as a national security advisor in the last three White House administrations, outlined on Twitter that hundreds of thousands of people have already been displaced and ISIS is moving into the newly vulnerable part of Syria.

New York Times White House reporter Katie Rogers says that ISIS flags have already been spotted in the countryside near the Turkish border:

And the New York Times’ Rukmini Callimachi reported that ISIS detainees in the area have escaped:

On Sunday, Trump tried to rationalize his foreign policy via Twitter, saying that the two camps have been at war for years and that he is monitoring the situation closely. He also proposed imposing sanctions on Turkey.

Why did this upset him? Because there was no corruption involved in Hunter Biden’s activities, and this meant that an anti-corruption effort wouldn’t do anything to help him smear the Biden family. He therefore recommended that President Trump get rid of her, and Trump happily agreed.
Elsewhere, Trump decided not merely to pull a small number of American troops out of northern Syria, but to do it in precisely the way that would cause the most chaos to both the United States and its allies. And that’s what he’s gotten. The Turks are shelling positions near the American troops that still remain, so Trump has now decided to pull them all out. As a result, our erstwhile allies, the Kurds, are now teaming up with the Russian-backed Assad government.
And in yet other news, after blowing up negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan because he didn’t understand what was going on, Trump is now trying to start them up again. Good luck with that.
Oh, and Trump’s buddy who served as roving ambassador to Ukraine is apparently prepared to testify that the only reason he said there was no quid pro quo required for Ukraine to receive its military aid is because Trump told him to say that. He himself, it seems, has no idea if it was true or not.

Scenes from the video, which parodies the 2014 film Kingsman: The Secret Service, shows a fake Trump indiscriminately opening fire inside the “Church of Fake News.” The church’s parishioners are portrayed as news outlets, including CNN, Buzzfeed, Politico, CBS, the Washington Post. A string of prominent critics of the president—Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Maxine Waters, the late Sen. John McCain, Rosie O’Donnell—are also featured as victims in the massacre. At one moment, Trump is depicted stabbing Hillary Clinton in the throat with a gun.
The airing of the violent images, which appear to be the work of a YouTube channel dedicated to “pissing off liberals,” come as the latest example of the president’s supporters embracing his increasingly extreme attacks against the media and political rivals. Outrage over the video spread quickly:



“That video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence,” Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Trump’s re-election campaign, told the New York Times, which first reported the video’s airing on Sunday.
“We find it shocking that the New York Times would not report on any of the sanctioned events in the article,” Alex Phillips, an organizer for the event, posted on the conference’s website. “Including our panel conversation LITERALLY condemning political violence while claiming to be upset over a meme that was not sanctioned, shown on stage, or approved.”
As Mother Jones reported last week, the American Priority conference was relocated this year to Trump National Doral Miami Golf Club in Florida after a disappointing inaugural event in DC last year.

Let’s check this out for young people. There’s no question that single-parent families are on the rise, but three-quarters of all kids still live in two-parent families. What’s more, it’s worth pointing out that the US is not a huge outlier on this front:
Teen suicides are up in recent years, but nowhere near a record:
Illicit drug use is way down in virtually every category:
And of course violent crime is way down too:
Self-reported rates of depression among teens is up in recent years, but it’s unclear if these numbers are accurate.
I’d add to this that teen pregnancy is down, graduation rates are up, school bullying is down, and test scores are up in both reading and math.
Now, this is just teens, and Barr was presumably talking about the population in general. However, if teens are doing pretty well, that speaks well both for how we’re raising our kids and how society is affecting bad behaviors.
Obviously not everything is peaches and cream. The opioid epidemic may be receding, but it’s a serious problem. And although the Case/Deaton “deaths of despair” thesis may be overstated, it’s still a problem too.
That said, it seems likely that the real problems we have are mostly centered not on the loss of religion, as Barr suggests, or on bad morals in general. The real problems are mostly centered on sluggish or nonexistent wage growth among the working and middle classes.

Now they are assembling back in Washington for a week where Syria is expected to be top of mind through the corridors of the Capitol—above, perhaps, even impeachment. At center stage is a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing Thursday with two State Department officials and a rash of unhappy members from both parties eager for answers. In a break from the normally staid titles of congressional hearings, this one is titled “The Betrayal of our Syrian Kurdish Partners: How Will American Foreign Policy and Leadership Recover?”, a sign that it could be far more explosive than a normal House oversight meeting, with representatives from both parties likely to ask tough questions of the Trump officials.
The session will focus on Trump’s decision to abandon the Kurds, who have become targets of the Turkish military after fighting Islamic State terrorists alongside the United States for the past five years. Later that morning, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley are scheduled to privately brief Senate Armed Services Committee members on “the situation in Syria and the wider region.”
In the Senate—an institution that hasn’t seen much cooperation between Republicans and Democrats in recent times—Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) plan to introduce sanctions against Turkey week with bipartisan support.
Graham and other lawmakers have railed against Trump’s rash decision to remove US special forces from the region, which essentially provided Turkey a green light to enter northeastern Syria and bomb Kurdish territory. At least nine civilians, including a Kurdish political leader, have already been killed in the strikes. Congressional Republicans fear that Trump’s withdrawal will create a pathway for ISIS to reemerge in Syria, where the Kurds have kept watch over thousands of terrorist detainees since the group was forced out of its last shard of territory in March. And, right on cue, hundreds of prisoners escaped at the onset of Turkey’s bloody campaign against the Kurds.
Trump’s pullout provided a big boost to Iran and Russia too. Without American allies to rely on, the Kurdish-backed Syrian Defense Forces signed an agreement this week to welcome Syrian government forces into northeastern Syria to assist in its defense against Turkey. The beleaguered Syrian government has long been propped up by Iran and Russia’s money and weapons.
“Mr. President: change course while you still can,” Graham tweeted on Friday. Two days later, Trump did the opposite and doubled down on the strategy of letting the Kurds and Turkey fight it out without American interference. Esper announced that Trump will remove most of the 1,000 US troops left in northern Syria.
On Thursday, James Jeffrey, lead US diplomat for Syria policy and envoy to the counter-ISIS campaign, can expect to face heated inquiries from lawmakers along those lines when he takes center stage at the House Foreign Relations Committee hearing alongside Joey Hood, principal deputy assistant secretary for near eastern affairs.
Committee member Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) tells Mother Jones that he’s “most interested” in asking about what Trump told American allies about his conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan before apparently green-lighting the invasion. “I’d also like to know how they plan to keep the troops that are currently there safe,” he said. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), another committee member, wants to know what the State Department and Pentagon recommended to Trump before his call with Erdoğan, and if he was informed of the potential casualties that would result from a troop withdrawal. “I want to know if the Department of Defense or the State Department gave him an assessment of how many Kurdish allies would die,” Castro says. “Did he ask for that?”
Committee chair Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and top Republican Michael McCaul (R-Texas) have already made their displeasure with Trump’s strategy clear by introducing legislation to sanction Turkish officials and banks until Erdoğan ends the invasion of Syria. To override a potential veto from Trump, their bill must receive the support of two-thirds of members in the Democratic-majority House and Republican-majority Senate. Previous bipartisan ventures of this sort—such as legislation to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia—failed to do.
The Senate sanctions package targets a similar range of Turkish officials and institutions and received a major boost Monday when Trump said he “will soon be” issuing an executive order to sanction Turkish officials himself. On Twitter, Trump has oscillated between defending Turkey, belittling the Kurds, and threatening to “obliterate” Turkey’s economy if Turkish forces do anything “off limits” in Syria, but he appeared to indicate support for sanctions during a conversation with Graham on Sunday.
There won’t be a shortage of votes to condemn Turkey. Outside of few supporters like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a frequent critic of American military interventions abroad, Trump is facing near-unanimous backlash from Republicans and Democrats alike.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) even condemned Trump’s decision, saying in a statement that “it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.” McConnell’s support will be key to bringing a sanctions bill to the floor of the Senate and ensuring it reaches a veto-proof majority.
Before speaking with Graham on Sunday, Trump provided a hint of his intention to punish Turkey, saying that he would deal with Graham and “many members of Congress, including Democrats” over whether to issue sanctions. “There is great consensus on this,” Trump said, adding that “Turkey has asked that it not be done.”
“Stay tuned!”

Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old black woman, was declared dead early Saturday morning. The police received an “open structure” call around 2:30 a.m. from a neighbor who was concerned because Jefferson’s front door was open.
Upon arrival, police searched the perimeter of the home and spotted someone standing inside near a window. According to a statement released by the department, the officer perceived a threat and fired one shot through the window, which struck Jefferson. She was pronounced dead at the scene. A family lawyer says that Jefferson was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew that night—Jefferson heard a noise in the yard and went to investigate.


The officer, whose name has not been released, is a white male who has been with the department since April 2018. He was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, according to CBS News. Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price called the incident “tragic” in a statement Saturday. “A young woman lost her life, leaving her family in unbelievable grief,” it reads. “All of Fort Worth must surround Atatiana Jefferson’s family with prayers, love and support.” Price also promised a thorough investigation.
Meanwhile, the department released body camera footage of the shooting.

News of Jefferson’s death has sparked outrage on social media. Kimberle Crenshaw, a legal scholar who has led groundbreaking efforts to study and recognize police violence against black women wrote, “Not safe even in our own homes.”

Charlene Caruthers, a prominent activist who formerly led a youth project in Chicago for young black activists called BYP 100, questioned the value of calling the police to do so-called wellness checks in the first place.

Earlier this month, former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was sentenced to a decade in prison for killing her neighbor, Botham Jean, after she mistook his apartment for her own one night after a shift in 2018. Jean was also black. As Ibram X. Kendi, an antiracist scholar, pointed out on Twitter, “To know at any moment, racism can execute you and probably get away with it, is to know what it means to be Black in America.”

But this week, the show brought on Lin Manuel Miranda to play Castro in the show’s cold open last night that was based on CNN’s LGBT town hall.
The show modeled the town hall after a drag ball a la Pose, the award-winning drama on FX. They set the tone by using the show’s breakout star, Billy Porter, to introduce the candidates. “And now, from the Haus of Urban Deliciousness,” he cried by way of introduction to Castro.
Manuel’s portrayal of Castro was significant not just by virtue of representing Castro onstage, but also because it played perfectly on the candidate’s burgeoning reputation as especially “woke” on issues related to sex and gender. At one point, he joked, “As a Democrat, I want to apologize for not being gay.” He also dubbed himself the “Latinobama.”

They responded not just with the songs they felt were most associated with coming out but also with their thoughts about how music connects specifically with the queer experience. Some even offered advice for those who are still finding their way out of the closet. These answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.
“Shake It Out,” by Florence + The Machine

“I listened to it on repeat the night I came out. There’s a lyric, ‘It’s always darkest before the dawn’ that I kept scribbling into my journal until I finally got the courage to go upstairs and tell my parents I was gay. I knew things would be awkward and wasn’t sure how they’d react, but that lyric gave me a lot of comfort because no matter what happened I was determined to make the best out of the situation. Coming out never stops, but it honestly gets so much easier over time the more you do it—to the point where you don’t even think about it as coming out anymore and just sharing who you are.”—Phillipe Thao, 23, Chicago
“Loser Like Me,” by the Glee cast

“It’s a song about empowerment in the broadest sense. It subverts their ‘loser-ness’ by turning it into something to be proud of. It kind of mirrors how queer people have long turned sources of derision into sustenance. I often think that pop music is especially queer, because it grapples vaguely with themes like love, dreams and dreaminess, and longing, and queer people can latch onto those themes in a way specific to them. It seems like people—straights, I mean—often think, ‘You should just do it—I know that your family will understand!’ But it’s not that simple. For me, building up a small army of people you know will back you helped prepare me for potentially harder coming out conversations.”—Brandon Tensley, 29, Washington, DC
“So Unsexy,” by Alanis Morissette

“I have an insanely vivid memory of being in sixth grade, desperately in love with my best friend and terrified about what that meant, keeping all these big scary feelings inside—believing I was totally alone and misunderstood. This song was the one thing that made me feel like I wasn’t this weird, horrible abomination, and that maybe what I was feeling wasn’t actually wrong or bad. The first time I heard a female artist sing about heartbreak using she/her pronouns to talk about her love was life changing. Knowing there are other people out there, going through the exact same thing, having those same experiences, makes your entire identity feel more valid. The real scary thing is not being able to live your truth, so if you’re in a place where you can safely [come out], you absolutely should.”—Lauren Feller, 28, Los Angeles
“BFF,” by Kreayshawn

“I was really obsessed with Kreayshawn when I was reconciling my sexuality. I never had a coming out moment where I made a public announcement, I just started acting more like myself continuously and being more honest about everything. ‘BFF’ gave me the courage to come out to my best friend at the time, because it reminded me that she was my best friend and was going to support me. Your coming-out process is ultimately about you and improving your life, so while other people’s experiences may help you to understand how you want to approach it, just keep in mind that it’s not about what others expect from you or what you think others want. Do what feels right when it feels right for you.”—Matt Van Ommeren, 24, Queens, New York
“Freedom,” by Beyoncé

“I cannot fully articulate the feeling in my body when I watched the visual album and how much it connected with my soul. It empowered me as a Black woman. It empowered me as an African woman. It empowered me as a queer Black African woman. Hearing the power in her voice as she sang, ‘I break chains all by myself…’ made me cry and reminded me about the strength of Black women, but also the need for vulnerability and healing. I was in healthy friendships at that time and luckily for me everyone was very supportive or was like, Bitch, we been knew you’re queer, which made me feel so loved. I love being bisexual. People have varying levels of safety so my advice wouldn’t be ‘come out to everyone!’ The most important thing is to come out to yourself. I am still not out to my mom, which is what it is, but I am surrounded by so many people who accept me. Surround yourself with love and people you feel comfortable enough to come out to. It’ll be hard. It’ll feel weird. But it is such a relief to be who you are and not have to hide it from the whole world.”—Marna Wal, 23, Minneapolis
“Bad Romance,” by Lady Gaga

“Music is just inherently part of the LGBT+ experience. Whatever you’re feeling now has been felt by thousands of others, you really aren’t alone. I felt fully free was when I was home on leave for Christmas after enduring Air Force Boot Camp. Don’t Ask Don’t Tell was still a ‘thing,’ so I still couldn’t be completely open. While it doesn’t always get better, the good times truly outweigh the bad. You find new family and friends, and now more than ever there’s so many avenues to let your flag fly. Come out at your own pace, we’ll be waiting.”—Brad Gilligan, 30, Las Vegas
“The Window,” by Kitty feat. American Pleasure Club

“I’ve been listening to Kitty since she was collaborating with Riff Raff and her music was more hip-hop based. That also happened to be around the time I was a senior in high school, discovering for the first time that I was in love with a girl. Representation matters, and I can’t imagine not having some queer idols growing up to help me feel comfortable with who I am.”—Alexa Jobe, 23, Santa Cruz, California
“A Moor,” by Raleigh Ritchie

“It was the song I was literally spinning the day I came out. [Music] makes you feel less alone. I lived in a small sheltered town with no one else like me, so to hear your experiences out loud through music can be so affirming and make you not feel crazy. Your life and the way the world opens up to you is about to change, but in spite of that, you are free to be your most authentic self. Something most people never get the chance to realize. Embrace yourself and what is to be.”—Uzo, 21, Chicago
“Follow Your Arrow,” by Kacey Musgraves

“When I was coming out it was kind of a weird process because I was sort of outed in high school, which pushed me to come out to my parents and close friends. Music can show queer people that they aren’t alone, and it sounds cheesy but it shows that things do get better. It’s especially true when you grow up where the LGBTQ community isn’t accepted, or if you don’t know many LGBTQ people who can help you through everything. You also don’t have to figure out your sexuality right away, coming out and discovering yourself is a process that takes a lot of time, so go at your own pace and not the pace you think will make everyone else happier.”—Matt Allen, 23, Los Angeles
“We Exist,” by Arcade Fire

“I recall the song and think about the active process of constantly coming out in a physical environment every time I’m out with my boyfriend. [Music] offers a sense of atmosphere—at times it amplified the lowest of lows by stewing or digesting the conflict or insecurity of not adhering to the ‘default’ sexuality. Take your time. There’s no rush. There’s no timeline. Find the people who prove they are worth keeping in your corner, regardless of your path, and look forward to growing.”—Luis Vargas, 24, Chicago
“Teenage Dream,” by the Glee cast

“Ryan Murphy made my song of sadness an anthem of gay pride when Darren Criss sang ‘Teenage Dream’ on Glee to Chris Colfer. That was the first time I’d ever seen anyone like me (a private school gay) on screen. Being gay is dichotomous. I like that ‘Teenage Dream’ exists as a tangible reminder that life being my truest self will bring euphoria and despair. Growing up, I clung to the songs that were playing in moments where I was happy. Coming out is deeply personal and different for everyone. It’s not a monolith. Do it on your terms. And if you don’t have a physical community, go online or find it in art.”—Joseph Longo, 22, New York City, New York
“Normal Song,” by Perfume Genius

“At the time I was feeling a lot of really unbearable self hatred and shame and this song made me feel like my heart was still good and that I was still worthy of love, even if I would never be ‘normal.’ Music can tell us things that we’ve never heard, or might never hear explicitly, from the people in our lives. I needed to hear that I wasn’t broken, and I definitely didn’t know how to ask for it, but I could listen to these songs and hear it over and over again. You will find people who understand you, see you, and care deeply about you. No queer person fits into a single mold and it’s okay for your identity to grow and change and be fluid. However and whenever you choose to come out is the right time and way.”—Sam Bellamy, 25, Brooklyn, New York",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Google has made “substantial” contributions to some of the most notorious climate deniers in Washington despite its insistence that it supports political action on the climate crisis.
Among hundreds of groups the company has listed on its website as beneficiaries of its political giving are more than a dozen organizations that have campaigned against climate legislation, questioned the need for action, or actively sought to roll back Obama-era environmental protections.
The list includes the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a conservative policy group that was instrumental in convincing the Trump administration to abandon the Paris agreement and has criticized the White House for not dismantling more environmental rules.
Google said it was disappointed by the US decision to abandon the global climate deal, but has continued to support CEI.
Google is also listed as a sponsor for an upcoming annual meeting of the State Policy Network (SPN), an umbrella organization that supports conservative groups including the Heartland Institute, a radical anti-science group that has chided the teenage activist Greta Thunberg for “climate delusion hysterics”.
SPN members recently created a “climate pledge” website that falsely states “our natural environment is getting better” and “there is no climate crisis”.
Google has defended its contributions, saying that its “collaboration” with organizations such as CEI “does not mean we endorse the organizations’ entire agenda.”
It donates to such groups, people close to the company say, to try to influence conservative lawmakers, and – most importantly – to help finance the deregulatory agenda the groups espouse.
A spokesperson for Google said it sponsored organizations from across the political spectrum that advocate for “strong technology policies”.
“We’re hardly alone among companies that contribute to organisations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy,” the spokesperson said. Amazon has, like Google, also sponsored a CEI gala, according to a program for the event reported in the New York Times.
CEI has opposed regulation of the internet and enforcement of antitrust rules, and has defended Google against some Republicans’ claims that the search engine has an anti-conservative bias.
But environmental activists and other critics say that, for a company that purports to support global action on climate change, such tradeoffs are not acceptable.
“You don’t get a pass on it. It ought to be disqualifying to support what is primarily a phony climate denying front group. It ought to be unacceptable given how wicked they have been,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island who is one of the most vocal proponents of climate action in Congress.
“What all of corporate America should be doing is saying if you are a trade organization or lobby group and you are interfering on climate, we are out. Period,” he added.
On its website, Google says it is committed to ensuring its political engagement is “open, transparent and clear to our users, shareholders, and the public”.
But the company declined to answer The Guardian’s questions on how much it has given to the organizations.
On a webpage devoted to “transparency”, it describes the groups – among hundreds of others, including some progressive advocates such as the Center for American Progress – as having received “substantial” contributions.
Apart from CEI, they include the American Conservative Union, whose chairman, Matt Schlapp, worked for a decade for Koch Industries and shaped the company’s radical anti-environment policies in Washington; the American Enterprise Institute, which has railed against climate “alarmists”; and Americans for Tax Reform, which has criticised companies who support climate action for seeking out “corporate welfare”.
It has also donated undisclosed sums to the Cato Institute, which has voiced opposition to climate legislation and questioned the severity of the crisis. Google has also made donations to the Mercatus Center, a Koch-funded think tank, and the Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action, a pressure group that said the Paris agreement was supported by “cosmopolitan elites” and part of Barack Obama’s “destructive legacy”.
Bill McKibben, a prominent environmentalist who has been on the frontline of the climate crisis for decades, said Google and other companies were engaged in a “functional greenwashing” given the contradiction in their public pronouncements and private donations. He said Google and other technology companies had also not used their own lobbyists to advocate for change on climate.
“Sometimes I’ll talk to companies and they will be going on and on about their renewable server farm or natural gas delivery, and I say thank you, but what we really need is for your lobbying shop in Washington to put serious muscle behind it. And they never do,” McKibben said. “They want some tax break or some regulations switch and they never devote the slightest muscle behind the most important issue of our time or any time.”
A spokesperson for Google said: “We’ve been extremely clear that Google’s sponsorship doesn’t mean that we endorse that organization’s entire agenda – we may disagree strongly on some issues.
“Our position on climate change is similarly clear. Since 2007, we have operated as a carbon neutral company and for the second year in a row, we reached 100% renewable energy for our global operations.”
The company said it called for “strong action” at the climate conference in Paris in 2015 and helped to sponsor the Global Climate Action summit in San Francisco last year.
But that position is at odds with the support it gives to CEI.
The group’s director of energy and environment policy, Myron Ebell, helped found the Cooler Heads Coalition 20 years ago, a group of libertarian and rightwing organizations that have sowed the seeds of climate denial with funding from the fossil fuel industry.
When Donald Trump was elected to the White House in 2016, Ebell joined the transition team and advised the new president on environmental issues, successfully lobbying Trump to adhere to a campaign promise and abandon the Paris agreement.
Kert Davies, the founder of the Climate Investigations Center, a research group that examines corporate campaigning, said Ebell had led the anti-climate-action crusade for decades.
“They’re extremists,” he said, referring to the Cooler Heads Coalition. “They are never finished,” he said. “Myron has taken a lot of credit for Trump’s actions and is quite proud of his access.”
Recently, however, Ebell – who declined a request for an interview – has criticized the White House for not rolling back environmental protections aggressively enough, even though the Trump administration has gutted every major environmental act established under Obama.
His wishlist now includes reversing a 2009 finding by the Environmental Protection Agency that CO2 and other greenhouse gases endanger the health and welfare of Americans.
CEI said it “respects the privacy of its donors” and declined to answer questions about Google. A CEI spokesperson told the Guardian: “On energy policy, CEI advances the humanitarian view that abundant and affordable energy makes people safer and economies more resilient. Making energy accessible, especially for the most vulnerable, is a core value.”
One source who is familiar with Google’s decision-making defended the company’s funding of CEI.
“When it comes to regulation of technology, Google has to find friends wherever they can and I think it is wise that the company does not apply litmus tests to who they support,” the source said.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

As Ukrainegate unfolds, it’s possible that his new personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, may also be facing federal criminal charges.
Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Giuliani broke lobbying laws in his work in Ukraine, according to a New York Times report Friday night. The Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) requires anyone who is attempting to influence United States policy on behalf of a foreign entity to register with the Justice Department and submit details of activities on behalf of that country, regardless of whether direct lobbying is involved. Giuliani joined Trump’s personal legal team to protect him from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Now, in a twist befitting the Trump era, he appears to be under investigation for bringing foreign influence into US politics.
Giuliani is at the center of the unfolding Ukraine scandal that prompted the impeachment inquiry into Trump. Giuliani acted as a go-between for Ukrainian officials and the Trump administration to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, and dug around for evidence to bolster a conspiracy theory that Ukraine had tried to help the Democrats win the 2016 election—even though the US intelligence community and Mueller’s probe found that Russia interfered to help Trump.
But the possible criminal investigation into FARA violations comes from a sideshow to this central Ukraine scandal at the heart of the impeachment inquiry: whether Giuliani failed to report his foreign ties when he worked to oust the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled from Kiev this spring after Giuliani and two associates pressed for her removal. Those two associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested this week on charges of illegally funneling foreign money into US elections.
The Times reporters acknowledged that they did not know how far the investigation had progressed. Giuliani told the paper that he had no knowledge of an investigation into his activities and denied any work on behalf of Ukrainian officials. Giuliani spoke at length with a former prosecutor general of Ukraine, Yuriy Lutsenko, in January of this year.

Giuliani told the Times that this work had been on behalf of Trump, not Lutsenko.
Before joining Trump’s legal team, Giuliani did international consulting work, including for clients in Ukraine.

Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren is calling out Facebook for this reckless policy—by running Facebook ads with a false statement.
“Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,” the ad announces, above a picture of Trump and Zuckerberg shaking hands. “You’re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, ‘how could this possibly be true?'”
At this point, Warren’s campaign, unable to lie for more than two sentences, comes clean. “Well, it’s not. (Sorry.)” the ad continues. “But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform—and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.”
Indeed, by letting politicians spread debunked claims, a policy the company announced last month but says is not new, Facebook has opened up a huge loophole for politicians to spread fake news on its platform—they just have to pay for it themselves. The Trump campaign was quick to exploit the loophole, running ads with false accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden.
Facebook makes nearly all of its profits from advertising, and political ads are a growing chunk of revenue as the 2020 elections ramp up. In the last year and a half alone, the platform has raked in more than $800 million to run 5.2 million political ads—numbers that are growing by the day. The Trump campaign has poured more than $20.6 million into Facebook ads in that time frame, spending that has ramped up in recent weeks as Trump faces an impeachment inquiry. In his re-election effort and in his battles with Congressional Democrats, Trump relies on Facebook to spread his message.
Warren’s ad presses on the point that Facebook profits when Trump or any other politician turns to its platform to spread false information. “If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it,” the ad reads. “But Facebook just cashes Trump’s checks. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they’re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people.”
During the 2016 elections, Facebook became a conduit for fake news and voter suppression efforts—including those undertaken by the Trump campaign. Fake news stories on the platform generated more engagement than articles from major news outlets in the final months of elections, and nearly all of the top-performing lies were pro-Trump. Facebook has become a haven for white nationalists, as well. Even as the company has taken steps recently to tackle these problems, critics have complained from that the fixes are bandaids that will not root out the problems, in large part because Facebook profits off of viral content and ads. Facebook also seems loath to upset the Trump campaign and administration, which are already taking advantage of the platform’s lax advertising rules.
Warren has emerged as a top critic of Facebook and big tech more broadly during her campaign. She has a proposal to break up the biggest tech companies, including Facebook. That prompted Zuckerberg, in leaked audio, to say that he would sue a future Warren administration to stop an anti-trust action against the company.
Warren’s ad is the latest broadside in this debate between her campaign and the tech giant. Using Facebook’s own policy against it is a clever troll, but it’s an issue that could play a major role in the upcoming 2020 elections.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Unrest and violence on the part of young men is often attributed to economic conditions and accessibility of fringe ideologies online. But Attorney General Bill Barr apparently has a different theory for both of these problems: not enough religion.
In a speech at University of Notre Dame’s law school Friday, Barr blamed “secularists” and “so-called progressives” for wreaking havoc on American society. Barr’s depiction of a war between the non-religious and people of faith shocked legal experts, who saw Barr’s defense of religious freedom as an assault on the First Amendment’s protection against the government’s establishment of any religion.
“This is not decay,” Barr said. “This is organized destruction. Secularists and their allies have marshaled all the forces of mass communication, popular culture, the entertainment industry, and academia in an unremitting assault on religion & traditional values.” (Barr spent years profiting off of these same industries he is attacking. He served as general counsel at Verizon for eight years, held a had a paid position on the board of Time Warner for nine, and represented telecoms giant GTE in the 1990s.)


In his address Friday, Barr thundered against what he described as a “moral upheaval.” “Virtually every measure of social pathology continues to gain ground,” he said. “Along with the wreckage of the family we are seeing record levels of depression and mental illness, dispirited young people, soaring suicide rates, increasing numbers of alienated young males, an increase in senseless violence and the deadly drug epidemic.”
Barr pointed particularly to public schools, according to an account of the speech from the Indianapolis Star. “Ground zero for these attacks on religion are the schools,” Barr said. “To me this is the most serious challenge to religious liberty today.” There is decades of Supreme Court caselaw removing religion from public schools because the First Amendment bans the government from establishing or giving primacy to a religion.
This isn’t the first time Barr has decried secular culture. He has been an advocate for more religion in American government, schools, and law for decades and has a history of involvement with conservative religious groups including the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which litigated the Hobby Lobby case that allowed employers not to cover contraception coverage to employees. In 1995, for example, Barr penned an essay blaming “a steady and mounting assault on traditional values” since the 1960s for “soaring juvenile crime, widespread drug addiction and skyrocketing venereal diseases.”
Barr’s comments come as he is under a cloud of scandal for his active involvement in trying to find evidence of the unproven theory that Ukraine colluded with Democrats during the 2016 election—an effort that took Barr to Italy this year and may have dragged him into the Ukraine scandal that set of an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
On Twitter, legal experts reacted to Barr’s speech with dismay.

The story of the most profound betrayal a president can commit has vanished from the national discourse. And that is partly because of the Democrats.
Last Friday night, the Washington Post published a stunning article reporting that during an Oval Office meeting in May 2017, Trump told Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then–Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak that Trump was unconcerned about Moscow’s attack on the 2016 presidential election. Trump noted that the assault on the United States was no big deal because the United States did the same in other countries, according to three former officials. It was at this meeting that Trump, as had been previously reported, revealed highly classified information to his Russian visitors and said that his firing of FBI chief James Comey the previous day had relieved “great pressure” on him. Yet Trump’s comments dismissing the importance of the Russian attack—which, according to the US intelligence community, was mounted in part to help Trump win the White House—now stands as the most significant moment of that gathering, where Trump and the two Russians were photographed smiling.
The Post noted that after this discussion, White House officials took steps to keep Trump’s comments from becoming public, and limited distribution of a memo summarizing the conversation to only a few officials with the highest security clearances. The memo was kept from officials who normally would have access to this sort of report. (The newspaper also reported it was unclear whether the memo was hidden in the supersecret White House server, as were documents related to those Trump interactions with Ukraine that are now the subject of the impeachment inquiry.)
It has long been assumed that Trump’s meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak was in keeping with Trump’s stated desire to get past the 2016 election and Russia’s interference. But Trump telling the Russians he did not care about the attack goes much further. That would mark a dereliction of his primary duty as president: to protect the nation. The US intelligence community, the report of special counsel Robert Mueller, and two congressional investigations (led by Republicans) have each declared that Moscow covertly waged extensive information warfare against the United States to subvert American democracy. Yet here was Trump sending a message to the foreign adversary that staged this attack that he was indifferent about it—that Russia could get away with it and perhaps do so again. Certainly, Moscow could have read Trump’s I-don’t-care comment as an invitation for future underhanded intervention.
Numerous national security officials in Trump’s own administration, including current FBI chief Chris Wray and former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, have said Russia poses a serious threat to the 2020 elections. On Wednesday, when asked if Moscow would target the coming US election, Russian leader Vladimir Putin joked, “I’ll tell you a secret: Yes, we’ll definitely do it.” And he added in a stage whisper, “Just don’t tell anyone.” But Trump, who has denied or discounted the Russian attack ever since the campaign, has never echoed concerns about a Russian assault in 2020, and he has not signaled that thwarting another Moscow attack (or an attack on US elections from any other source) is a priority for him.
At that Oval Office meeting with the Russians, Trump was abandoning his primary responsibility as commander in chief. The shirking of a president’s most basic obligation—an easy-to-understand and easy-to-depict act of nonfeasance and malfeasance—could be expected to dominate the news for a few days and appear front and center in an impeachment inquiry. But it hasn’t.
In moments like these, news coverage is often shaped and determined by the actions and reactions of political players. Scandalous revelations tend to be driven forward in the media by the responses they engender. If an influential actor screams about a matter, the issue will probably receive more coverage. In the case of Trump’s nothing-to-worry-about comment to the Russians, the Democrats did not make a fuss, and the story has fizzled.
The morning after the Washington Post broke this news, I ran into a prominent House Democrat. Won’t this disclosure of serious presidential negligence become a key part of the impeachment process? I asked her. Aren’t the Democrats going to jump on this with good cause?
No, she said, explaining that the House Democratic leadership believed it was best to keep the impeachment inquiry targeted on the Trump-Ukraine scandal and concentrate on Trump’s request to the Ukrainian president that he provide Trump dirt that could be used to discredit the Mueller probe and attack Joe Biden in seeming exchange for US missiles. This Democrat agreed with that approach: “We need to keep this narrow. It will be easier for the public to follow.” But how much easier is it to comprehend Trump’s supposed shakedown than his Oval Office treachery?
In the days that followed, the House Democrats indeed did little in response to the Post‘s story. As the Dems in charge of the Ukraine investigation were issuing subpoenas and arranging to take depositions related to that scandal, they did nothing about Trump’s sellout in the Oval Office. They did not demand the memos about that meeting that were restricted. They did not announce this would become an element of the impeachment probe. Another House Democrat says the party’s leadership “is laboring under the impression you can keep impeachment narrowly focused on Ukraine. They think people are sick and tired of Russia  and Putin. But this was aiding and abetting the enemy—and in the Oval Office.” (The Ukraine controversy is connected to the Trump-Russia scandal. Trump is in trouble with his phone call to Zelensky partly because he was leaning on the Ukrainian president for material that he believed would support an especially nutty conspiracy theory that insists the Russia scandal was nothing but a hoax created to undermine Trump.)
A House aide working on the Ukraine inquiry notes that the Democrats are overwhelmed with just the work of that probe. They are producing subpoenas and conducting interviews on a fast pace to prepare articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving. And this aide says there is “not enough bandwidth to jump into other stuff.” The aide adds, “Right now we are focused on concerns emanating from the president’s call on the Ukraine. We have rolled out a full agenda of investigative work. We are taking note of all these other issues that have emerged. But for now we are focused on this agenda.”
Perhaps zeroing in on the Ukraine scandal and Trump’s moblike abuse of power is the practical decision for House Democrats and investigators. It’s new; it’s manageable. It’s not muddied up the way the Trump-Russia controversy has become (due to the years-long disinformation campaign mounted by Trump and his cultists). Yet this means Trump is being let off the hook for a monumental act of perfidy. Consider this: The president of the United States, according to this report, essentially countenanced an attack on the United States. What could warrant impeachment more? But this story comes and then it goes. Only in the era of Trump would a possible act of treason on the part of the president be considered a second-tier matter and become lost in the swirl of tweets and other outrageous misdeeds.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Now, the fight over that promise has escalated into one of the most dramatic and bizarre showdowns of the 2020 election cycle.
It all started back in July, when the Ohio state legislature passed a law—called HB6—that, starting next year, will charge consumers new fees to rescue four struggling power plants. Those charges will eventually add up to a $1 billion bailout for the utility FirstEnergy Solutions’ two nuclear plants, while handing a lifeline to two 1950s-era coal plants owned by another utility, the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation.
Because of the law, Ohio is the first state to reverse its renewable energy standards and efficiency targets, all while funneling more money to coal—a move that has clean energy advocates fuming. Leah Stokes, an environmental political science professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, called it the “worst energy policy in the country.”
But this it isn’t your typical environmentalists-vs.-fossil-fuel-industry fight. The side opposing the bailout has clean-energy advocates working alongside the natural gas industry. And though the supporters of the bailout include some of the usual suspects—FirstEnergy, coal-reliant American Electric Power and Duke Energy, and the coal baron and Trump donor Robert Murray—they have also marshaled a mysterious string of deep-pocketed advocacy groups.
A bit of history: The fight dates back to at least 2014, when FirstEnergy pitched a bailout to Ohio’s utility regulator. FirstEnergy went bankrupt in 2018, around the same time it was urging the Trump administration to use emergency powers to save nuclear and coal. (The Department of Energy considered that proposal, but ultimately it went nowhere.) By early 2019, though, FirstEnergy saw a window of opportunity in the Ohio legislature and spent $1 million lobbying on the bailout law. According to an analysis by the Columbus Dispatch, it contributed almost $1 million to state candidates in the 2018 cycle, including $25,000 to help elect Larry Householder as the new speaker of Ohio’s House.
As soon as the law was passed in July, opponents formed a coalition called Ohioans Against Corporate Bailouts. The group, which aims to gather the 265,774 signatures required to get the referendum on the ballot in the 2020 election, hasn’t yet disclosed its funding, but observers suspect that it mostly comes from the renewable energy industry and natural gas companies.
In response, the law’s supporters have waged an unprecedented “all-out deceptive effort to prevent the issue from getting on the ballot,” says Dave Anderson who has tracked developments for the watchdog think tank Energy and Policy Institute.
In addition to FirstEnergy, a number of shadowy groups have materialized to oppose the referendum. Here’s a quick rundown of the major players:

Thousands of Ohioans received mailers from the same group warning, “Don’t give your personal information to the Chinese Government! Don’t sign their petition attacking House Bill 6!”
The claim, based on the fact that some gas plants received funding from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, has been roundly debunked. The ads neglect to mention the funding from other major global banks, or that FirstEnergy has loans from the same bank. “We have pretty strong regulation of utilities that would prevent foreign governments from controlling them,” David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told the Cincinnati Enquirer.
“These ads are some of the most bizarre and xenophobic I’ve ever seen in relation to energy, electricity, and climate,” says Director of Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Mary Anne Hitt.
While the groups opposing the referendum don’t disclose their funding, the Energy and Policy Institute has found links between several of them and FirstEnergy. For example, Protect Ohio Clean Energy Jobs appears to share an address with two lobbyists that FirstEnergy hired to pass HB6.
The Dayton Daily News recently reported that Ohio Attorney General David Yost is investigating some of these allegations of harassment and intimidation. His investigation includes a charge that the opposition has tried to buy off firms working with the referendum for as much as $100,000, which would be considered a felony under state law.
FirstEnergy has neither denied nor confirmed its role in the campaign to scuttle the referendum, instead maintaining that the referendum is unconstitutional and “inherently misleading and confusing to Ohio voters.”
Gene Pierce, a spokesperson for the referendum’s main support group, Ohioans Against Corporate Bailouts, admits that the efforts by the law’s supporters have slowed the signature-collecting process and “driven up the price to hire people.” The referendum has only recently launched a website and an ad campaign that fight back.
If the referendum fails, the outlook for Ohio’s clean-energy advocates could be bleak. The state is the third-biggest consumer of coal in the country. Nuclear power, which provides 15 percent of the state’s electricity, is the state’s biggest source of carbon-free energy. In 2018, the state got a measly 2.5 percent of its power from solar, wind, and biomass—making it one of the lowest users of renewable energy in the country.
Beyond the coal plants the new law helps directly, FirstEnergy has hinted that the extra money from the bailout may help it reverse its plan to close down one of its coal plants. The true cost of the bailout could be higher as coal becomes more unprofitable. All told, “there’s more money in the Ohio law to bail out dirty old coal plants than to support carbon-free nuclear power,” Stokes says.
Sierra Club’s Mary Anne Hitt echoed those concerns. She called the effort to uphold the bailout “one of the most extreme and also aggressive efforts like this that I have ever seen.” She added, “Unfortunately it’s regular Ohioans who end up paying the price.

It was a special evening for Ryan. His Pop-Up Museum of Queer History was making its debut, right here in his living space. Together with more than 30 exhibit makers, he had curated a makeshift museum that offered a comprehensive exhibit of queer history. “Somewhere between an art experience and a party, it was going to just be a single event to see what it would be like if there was such a thing as a queer museum, run by queer people, in queer space, with queer exhibits, by queer exhibit makers,” says Ryan. “It was fantastic.”
Yet, as history has shown, where queer people congregate, police tend to follow. Among those 300-plus people who filled every corner of his loft? Undercover cops—14 of them, in Ryan’s telling. When the clock struck midnight, the event got shut down, thus ending the exhibit’s life. Briefly. “My plan beyond this was to clean up and have breakfast,” remembers Ryan. “But people were so hungry for it.”
Ryan, along with other local curators and queer community leaders, took the pop-up concept around the country, from Philadelphia to Indianapolis. Each new local event, Ryan recalls, was met with “an incredible response,” but when they brought the pop-up museum back to Brooklyn, “people kind of scratched their heads and were like, ‘Queer history’?”
That’s when Ryan realized: “Wait, I don’t know anything about the queer history of Brooklyn, either.”
The New York native didn’t set out to write the book on Brooklyn’s queer history, but that’s exactly what happened. “I was like, shit, I gotta do this research, I’m really just interested,” he says. Ryan is no stranger to research: The author and historian regularly contributes to the Condé Nast publication them, has explored the literary origins of zombies, and has written about Rube Goldberg machines for the New York Times. “For years I was just doing research. Maybe it was going to be an exhibit with the Pop-Up Museum, maybe it’d be something else, maybe a series of articles.” He became so enamored with this hidden history of Brooklyn’s queers, he applied for a research grant from the New York Public Library—and got it.
“One of the first things they said to me was, when this grant period is over, you should have your book proposal completed,” he says. “I was like, Oh, I’m writing a book.” That book turned out to be When Brooklyn Was Queer. It opens in 1855 with Walt Whitman, maybe one of Brooklyn’s most famous queers, and from there Ryan takes the reader through a century of queerness, from Whitman’s Leaves of Grass to what Ryan calls “The Great Erasure” in the mid-1900s. It’s over 100 years threaded together, telling a story of a people so often lost to the straight-washing of history books.
Hugh Ryan joined me in Mother Jones’ New York City bureau, where he expanded on Brooklyn’s queer history, dove into the concept of sexuality and gender, and gave me insight into what history could teach about the next conflict in the queer movement. The transcript below has been edited for length and clarity. We’ve also included audio clips with his full responses.
You specifically focus on Brooklyn’s queer history. How did this history mirror the queer history of America at large?
One of the things that became obvious was the real density of queer history appears when Brooklyn becomes a city—when it urbanizes. When it gets that mix of density, economic opportunity, anonymity, and privacy that introduces people who live around the world and their different sexual mores. That’s a process deeply implicated in urbanism, which obviously throughout the US is a big change that comes—this huge movement of people moving away from rural spaces into cities. Those two themes, urbanism and the importance of intermingling spaces that provide intermingling, apply to the entire country, and the world.
Listen to the extended answer here:
https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MJ_HR_Interview_Answer.mp3
As someone who’s involved in the Brooklyn queer scene today, how do you think that today’s scene has been built upon this history?
That’s a complicated question, because my book goes up to about Stonewall. I stopped there because that’s when Brooklyn’s waterfront economy really tanked. The engine that drives all of this change and this possibility in Brooklyn, is the waterfront. And by the ’60s, the Navy Yard is closed. So the arc I was following sort of ends there. But of course, queer life in Brooklyn doesn’t end there. I’m following one set of stories, and what emerges after that moment is a cacophony of stories.
https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MJ_HR_Interview_Answer_2.mp3
If I had read something like this in high school, it would have been incredible to have that knowledge about a people you belong to.
In originally coming to queer history I was looking for a mirror. I wanted to see myself somewhere, because I hadn’t growing up. Then, the more I looked at it, the more I was like, Those people are similar to me, but I’m looking through a window, they’re very different. What I learned growing up about homosexuality is it’s always been terrible, and always will be terrible, and it would never change. And the closet is just more and more closety as you go further back. That’s not the case at all.
https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MJ_HR_Interview_Answer_3.mp3
I was surprised at how welcoming of queer people the country was at certain times. How do you think being queer in today’s climate compares with the moments that you write about?
Every moment is so different. There are ways in which we are much more visible, accepted, open. There’s so much more possibility for us today. When I go back further and look at the Victorian era, we don’t think we see homosexuality very often there—and I would say, as we think of it today, we don’t. These people were living lives where it was expected for them to have incredibly intense homosocial relationships between men, between women. We only understand what we think of today as homosexuality against the backdrop of the death of Victorian homosociality. What becomes obvious after that moment is people who spend too much time with each other, whose friendships between their own sex are too intense, but in 1820, that wasn’t visible because those intense friendships were proper. So I don’t think you can even have a sense of sexuality, as we think of it today, as existing then.
https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MJ_HR_Interview_Answer_4.mp3
You begin the book with Walt Whitman, and in doing so you introduced the reader into a past in which the word “homosexual” didn’t even exist. Why is he an example of living in this world devoid of modern queer language?
Leaves of Grass, which he writes and publishes in Brooklyn Heights, is an incredibly queer document in many ways. He consciously conceives of it that way. He writes these poems into it that are about finding “them that love as I myself am capable of loving,” which is how he puts it at one point. He’s trying to write into existence, words, and rituals for something that he was seeing. The idea of saying sexuality was a thing separate from gender was unbelievable. Whitman not only shows us something that looks very similar to what we know today, but he also problematizes it and makes you say, “Oh, this is historically bounded, this started at a certain time.”

This California Lawmaker Actually Does.,Marisa Endicott,MotherJones,Politics,"In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has escalated his ongoing feud with California, repeatedly turning his attention and Twitter feed to the state’s homelessness crisis. The administration is reportedly planning a crackdown that may involve moving homeless people in the state to government-backed facilities. After visiting last month, Trump claimed—seemingly without basis—that needles and other trash from San Francisco and Los Angeles are “pouring into the ocean.” Confusingly, he tied the cities’ legitimate housing problems to water pollution, threatening federal action for supposed Clean Water Act violations. Then, last week, the EPA lent credence to the president’s claims by citing San Francisco for environmental violations relating to its homeless problem. (Ironically, Trump and the EPA voiced sudden concern for California’s environmental protections around the same time they officially revoked the state’s ability to set stricter auto emissions.) On Thursday, in response to this and other recent EPA actions against the state, almost 600 former EPA officials called for an investigation into the administration’s targeting of California, saying the warnings “were intended as retaliation for the state’s failure to support President Trump’s political agenda.”
Meanwhile, in the 2020 budget request, the Trump administration proposed cutting the Housing and Urban Development budget by a drastic $9.6 billion (19 percent below 2019 levels).
The absurdity of Trump’s attacks, though, shouldn’t paper over the very real housing crisis in California. State Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco—where the median price for a one-bedroom rental is about $3,700 a month—has seen this crisis up close and has been a vocal affordable housing proponent since he served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He’s known for pushing bold but sometimes controversial policies. He is currently sponsoring a bill, after a previous iteration failed last year, that aims to ease the housing squeeze by increasing high-density residential building around transit hubs. The proposal has left affordable housing advocates divided; more housing could ease costs and outsized demand, and the current version of the bill includes more renter protections and affordability requirements, but some think it will exacerbate gentrification.
What they can all agree on is that Trump doesn’t know what he’s talking about. “Our housing policy doesn’t work in California,” Wiener says. But “the president is not interested in helping us solve our problems.” I recently caught up with Wiener to talk about the real roots of the housing dilemma, the solutions he thinks are necessary, and why the president’s comments pretty much make no sense. Below is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.
President Trump has made accusations about San Francisco and California’s homelessness problem causing water pollution. Then last week, the EPA cited San Francisco, saying the city could face fines for violating the Clean Water Act.
The attacks are really despicable and baseless. This idea that somehow feces or needles could be going into the sewer drain and that would go directly into the ocean, that’s just flat out wrong. If the president knew anything about our sewer system, he would know we have a combined sewer system. All of our sewage, whether it comes from people’s toilets or from the sewer drains, gets treated at a world class water treatment facility and purified. And so there’s just no factual basis for what what he’s saying. You expect this kind of ridiculousness from Donald Trump, but you don’t expect that from the EPA.
The EPA has been involved with San Francisco’s combined sewer system for a long time. It has repeatedly signed off on different changes that we’ve made. And now the EPA has been politically hijacked by Donald Trump to issue some sort of notice of violation where there is no violation. It plays into the president’s broader political narrative attacking California, attacking San Francisco, for the exclusive goal of riling up his base because his presidency is falling apart.
We need to be clear: We have a real problem with homelessness in California. There’s no doubt about it. Our housing policy doesn’t work in California. We have big problems. But the president is not interested in helping us solve our problems. He’s simply interested in attacking us to score political points.
What will happen with the EPA citation?
I think it is a stunt and he’ll probably keep going down this road until the election. But ultimately, the city of San Francisco strongly disagrees with the EPA’s political assertions, and I suppose it could result in litigation. But we’ve been litigating with this administration quite a bit, so there’s nothing new there.
What does the federal government do to help or hurt states and cities tackling homelessness?
This president has just been atrocious in terms of providing help and resources to cities and states and our efforts to fight homelessness. He’s been cutting affordable housing funds. He’s been cutting food assistance, aggressively attacking the social safety net, trying to throw people off health care. These are all things that increase homelessness. If he wants to help us fight homelessness by increasing investment in housing and other services, then we welcome that.
There’s still the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit, which we rely on. But in the past, the federal government funded significant investment in housing and that’s really drying up. And we would love for that to come back so we can build more public or social housing for low-income people.
Why is the homelessness problem in California so intractable despite big investments and a lot more focus?
The push has really only been in the last few years. Before a few years ago, California wasn’t doing nearly enough. It’s still not doing enough, but it’s doing more, and I think some of those seeds that were planted will bear fruit. But we also have to fix our underlying housing scarcity problem. We’re short 3.5 million homes in California, and it’s pushing a lot of working class people into homelessness, people who don’t have any mental health or addiction problems, but they lose their apartment, and there’s nothing they can afford so they live in their car. And that is a result of 50 years of bad housing policy where we’ve made it hard or impossible to build new housing. That’s the underlying root cause. Financial investments are very important, but there is not going to be enough funding to house every low-income person in California. So we have to solve the structural housing shortage as well.
What actions are most important to take?
There are three major things we need to prevent people from becoming homeless: We need to be protecting renters, so people aren’t getting evicted in no fault evictions and ending up on the street; we need to invest aggressively in helping transition homeless people into housing with support services; and then we have to make structural changes to our housing policy to fix the problem over the long run. That’s what SB 50 is about—my legislation to legalize more housing by jobs and transit, so we can start filling in that 3.5 million home gap.
What do you think of the drama that’s played out with a San Francisco neighborhood putting up boulders on the sidewalk to discourage homeless encampments? [Editor’s note: In September, a group of San Francisco neighbors pooled funds and had boulders installed along the sidewalk to break up a homeless encampment and cut down on reported drug dealing and harassment on the block. Homeless advocates were critical, calling the tactic inhumane; activists and media coverage sparked a barrage of social media outrage and threats against the residents. Last week, the city removed the rocks, but strategic landscaping to deter homelessness is used in other parts of San Francisco and other cities.]
Boulders on the sidewalk are not the solution. But with that said, I don’t think it’s appropriate to demonize these neighbors. I used to represent this area when I was on the [San Francisco] Board of Supervisors, and I’m very familiar with Clinton Park. This was not just about homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk. It was not what pushed these neighbors over the edge. It was the rampant and very dangerous behavior of drug dealing, the violence, the harassment. The neighbors reached the end of their rope, and I can’t criticize them. The city was not meeting their needs, and they took it into their own hands. I was really disappointed to see the really vicious attacks on these neighbors for trying to address an issue in their neighborhood. Again, boulders are not the solution, but I understand why they got to the point where they felt they had no other choice.
I think it is really, really important to distinguish between homelessness and criminal behavior. Because when people are engaging in criminal violence and harassment and drug dealing, homeless people are being victimized, too. I’ve had homeless people come up to me on the street and point out a guy that’s being violent and ask me to call the police. The vast majority of homeless people are not engaging in criminal or violent behaviors. They’re just trying to survive, and they’re being victimized as well.
What’s the immediate solution?
In the tent encampments, we need to really focus on transitioning those folks into navigation centers and then transitional housing. Tents on the sidewalk are not a good or safe healthy approach for the homeless or people in the surrounding neighborhood. For people who are engaged in drug dealing and violent behavior, we have to enforce the law.
But then there’s NIMBY resistance to setting up navigation centers like in the Embarcadero. [Editor’s note: After San Francisco Mayor London Breed proposed a navigation center—a type of streamlined transitional homeless shelter— in the Embarcadero neighborhood this spring, residents of the gentrifying SoMa area rallied to block the facility from being built. Their efforts, including raising money against the effort and filing a lawsuit, failed, but were seen as part of the the strong NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) presence in the the Bay Area.]
I actually passed a law this year that streamlines navigation center approvals so we’ll be able to avoid these endless lawsuits and appeals as occurred at the Embarcadero. That will address the NIMBYism that we’re seeing around navigation centers.
A lot of people support services for homeless people, but then they have concerns about putting them in their neighborhood. But what we try to explain to people is that homeless people are in your neighborhood. And so why not have a place where we can start transitioning people into housing and services? It’s better to have navigation centers where people go than people pitching tents on sidewalks. People are going to go somewhere, so let’s have somewhere for them to go where they can begin the process of getting them housed.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Those new subpoenas could come as early as today. Meanwhile, two of Rudy Giuliani’s associates who helped him in Ukraine were arrested on campaign finance violations.

7:04 p.m. ET: Before and after President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens in July, several national security officials “raised concerns with a White House lawyer,” the Washington Post reported Thursday night.
The Post reported:
4:25 p.m. ET: House Democrats subpoena Energy Secretary Rick Perry for documents related to the impeachment inquiry.

https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/does-hong-kong-even-need-the-nba/,2019-10-11,,,politics,"October 10, 2019",Does Hong Kong Even Need the NBA?,A. Liu,MotherJones,Politics,"Last Friday night, Daryl Morey, the general manager of the NBA’s Houston Rockets, tweeted an image with the seemingly innocuous text: “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” Within the hour, he was forced to delete the tweet, his account under siege by angry replies from Chinese nationalists. By Saturday, the Rockets had been effectively erased from mainland Chinese media coverage. In response, the league clarified that it did not defend Morey’s tweet; the Rockets’ owner issued a forceful statement of neutrality; and star guard James Harden stated simply, “We apologize. We love China,” the rhetorical equivalent of his signature, questionably legal stepback jumper.
In the US, journalists and politicians piled on the NBA for its lack of conviction. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke called the league’s “prioritization of profits over human rights” an “embarrassment.” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he was proud to see Morey “call out the Chinese Communist Party’s repressive treatment of protestors,” but that now the NBA was “shamefully retreating.” Just this summer, the league signed a five-year, $1.5 billion streaming deal with Tencent Holdings, one of the media companies to erase the Rockets’ presence, and by one estimate, the NBA China office is now worth $4 billion. Outside official activities, the China market remains an attraction for Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour, which regularly dispatch their biggest stars (and Derrick Rose) to exhibitions across China each summer. That this money is weighing on the minds of NBA owners and players is beyond question. “The NBA is a business,” we’re told time and again by players, management, and media tied to the league.
What seems far less certain, however, is the assumption implicit in much of the commentary that if only members of the NBA or Western leaders could more openly condemn the People’s Republic of China, they could somehow effect meaningful change and counter “China’s dictatorial apparatus.” Lost in the conversation, after all, is the fact that the group whose slogan Morey tweeted is actively asking the British government to intervene into Hong Kong and China politics. Indeed, although the league has been craven in its handling of the affair, one ironic effect of the blowback has been to fit the protests into a Western-savior narrative whose political benefits for the people of China and Hong Kong are dubious.
A former British colony, Hong Kong officially rejoined the mainland People’s Republic of China in 1997 as part of a complicated and evolving “one country, two systems” scheme. Its protests have raged since June, ostensibly in response to an extradition bill that, among other things, would make Hong Kong citizens subject to deportation to China if suspected of crimes there. But the movement is leaderless and comprises many political tendencies, from right-wing and nativist to liberal to anarchist and socialist. It is an extension of the Umbrella Movement protests in 2014, sparked by Beijing reneging on earlier promises to give Hong Kong citizens greater democratic rights. But the frustrations are also economic and generational. Hong Kong’s level of income inequality is worse than that of any industrialized nation. For a decade, Hong Kong has suffered from the world’s most expensive housing, as hundreds of thousands live in illegal subdivided apartments of only a couple dozen square feet. Widening inequality has especially burdened the young, and not coincidentally, over half of the protesters are under 30 years old, most of them college-educated. Demands for “democracy” are about more than parliamentary and procedural reform; they’re also pleas for a greater voice in the economic future of Hong Kong and China. At the same time, many protesters are angered by the attitude of Beijing and Hong Kong officialdom that they can be bought off through development but without political participation. More recently, the protests have focused on the brutality of the local police response. The demonstrations are not solely about the bill or abstract notions of “democracy.”
At first glance, the Chinese state’s response to Morey is a departure from its relatively understated approach to the demonstrations. From almost the beginning of the summer, observers have watched with bated breath, fearing a second Tiananmen Incident in which the Chinese state crushes protesters through military might. But Xi Jinping and the party leadership, according to close observers, have adopted the strategy of simply waiting out the protests without the public threat of force, even as descriptions of local police brutality continue to stream through the news. The central authorities trust that the government and its silent majority of business elites have more staying power than the young and middle-class demonstrators, whose numbers have begun to dwindle.
But there is a big difference between trying to finesse the outrage of your own people, upon whom your legitimacy stands, and responding in kind to a foreign threat. This logic was laid out clearly by Joseph Tsai, the new Taiwanese Canadian owner of the Brooklyn Nets, whose astounding purchase price of $2.3 billion reflects the inflated value the China market has endowed all NBA franchises.
Tsai defended the Chinese government’s position in a late Sunday night Facebook post. He took readers along an unexpected, abridged version of modern Chinese history, detailing the two opium wars (1839–1842, 1856–1860) fought between the Qing and British Empires, as well as the catastrophe of the Boxer Uprising (1898–1901), in which the Qing court sided with an anti-foreign, peasant-based movement in northern China that was then unceremoniously crushed by European, American, and Japanese soldiers in a bloody display of imperialist bravado. Tsai concluded that Chinese citizens—all 1.4 billion—therefore felt a collective “strong sense of shame and anger” at the prospect of foreign intervention or of the “separatist movement” in Hong Kong threatening Chinese sovereignty.
Tsai’s post should not be read at face value as an account of history. Instead, it is a distillation of the PRC state’s media strategy for handling criticism of its policies. Legitimate grievances are simply deflected as part of an alien, foreign conspiracy against the Chinese people. Morey’s crime was not so much his message as his status as foreign messenger. If anything, his tweet and the international support for it may serve as a blessing for the PRC and its claim that the only people who defend the Hong Kong protests are “Western” agitators.
Indeed, one is not quite sure where Tsai, an East Asian studies major at Yale, gets his history from. He presents a caricatured version of China’s recent past as national mythology, in which a traditional imperial dynasty is awoken from its slumber by British warships in 1842 and the Chinese people suffer a “century of humiliation” before liberation by the Communist Party. It is an account that certainly dovetails with what he would have learned in Cold War–era Taiwan, which taught the island’s history exclusively as the history of mainland China. But it is also one that scholars today, both outside China and within, have long disavowed. The problem is not that the events Tsai lays out did not happen, but that they’re presented as a one-sided victim narrative. Never mind that the Qing dynasty itself violently sought to stamp out loyalists from the previous dynasty as well as other threats along the frontiers. Or that the current Beijing-backed Hong Kong government has just invoked a British colonial-era emergency law to quell protests by its own people. So much for intervention by “the West.”
Of course, such disingenuousness is not limited to one side of the Pacific Ocean. Calls by the United States for greater “freedom,” “democracy,” and “human rights” in China should be met with similar circumspection. The political cause of stopping Communist China has long helped to mobilize the American conservative movement, Joyce Mao has demonstrated, even if the Communist Party today differs dramatically from its initial incarnation. The greatest champions of Hong Kong and Taiwan in DC have been Republican stalwarts such as Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, politicians who may promote democracy in Asia but rely upon voter suppression at home, who denounce human rights violations abroad but defend the separation of families and confinement in cages at the Texas border. If anything, American politicians share with their Chinese counterparts a predilection for denouncing foreign powers to distract from their own misdeeds.
Imagine the mental gymnastics required to believe American politicians would uphold the abstract rights of Hong Kong citizens they will never meet more strongly than they already do for constituents in their own backyard. Talk of “rights” and “freedom” may sound nice in theory, but they require the backing of force and the alignment of national interests behind them; why should we expect American politicians to sincerely defend the rights and interests of Hong Kong as their own?
In an odd way, a similar deflection is happening in some of the liberal criticism of China. The focus on the repressiveness of the Chinese speech regime obscures the fact that the scandal exists only because a US corporation and sports league cartel freely muzzled its own employee. China’s method might seem exotically hamfisted to us, but we have our own speech police here, too; it’s just that they do not need state backing. In the American way, limitations on political expression are privatized and decentralized.
But the point is not to equivocate between good and bad guys, heroes and villains. It is to suggest that a moralistic approach to this affair—especially one that pits two countries against one another—has the effect of Westernizing the story of the protests. Does this really help anyone but Chinese and American state interests?
What, then, should be done? On the NBA side, it has been frightening to watch the political chill setting in. It’s clear that the owners and players should have thought twice about sinking half of their business strategy into a region whose politics and history they hardly understand. Certainly, any fan would be happy to see players and coaches at this stage express some convictions rather than cower in the face of lost fortunes. This may bring the focus back to the games for a league already reeling from the offseason roster turnover (the Warriors won’t even be good this year). But these are American concerns, about other Americans. The broader question this episode has magnified is what exactly America’s role in the East Asia region should be. Would American celebrities speaking out more forcefully actually benefit the people of Hong Kong and mainland China?
For those sympathetic to the Hong Kong people’s protests against increasing inequality and social repression, there are only so many political routes imaginable. “A tiny border city of 7 million people,” journalist Wilfred Chan recently observed, “cannot singlehandedly dismantle the hegemonies that ensnare it.” Contrary to Tsai’s depiction of the protests as a separatist movement, many protesters are aware that the goal of absolute independence is unrealistic.
Many have thus looked to foreign states for support and defense; some have even been caught waving the flags of the United Kingdom and the United States. This solution also invites insidious political consequences. Two weeks ago, activist Joshua Wong traveled to Washington, DC, to entreat Congress to pass a law that would ostensibly promote “human rights” and “democracy” in Hong Kong. Closer scrutiny of the bill, however, reveals it is designed to protect US interests above all else. Among other consequences, it would strengthen the United States’ ability to monitor activists’ migration across borders, and it would require Hong Kong to join the US in levying economic sanctions against Iran and North Korea. It would also force Hong Kong to extradite future political refugees, such as Edward Snowden, back to the US—the very sort of neocolonial relationship that the protests sought to challenge in the first place. That this bill has been justified on the same abstract terminology of “human rights” and “democracy” that US journalists are now using to criticize the NBA controversy should give us pause about the strategy. Beware the star-spangled evocations of human rights and democracy. Very often these are words Americans use to talk about themselves. Just look at the lazy way journalists and politicians are jamming the Hong Kong protests into tortured analogies with the “woke” domestic causes, favored by NBA players, of paying student athletes, taking a knee, or ousting a racist owner. For too many critics, Hong Kong has become a mere prop in the US culture wars.
Here, as someone who hopes to return to China in the future and whose friends and family are part of the broader diaspora, I need to choose my words carefully: The global sympathy for the Hong Kong people has been heartening, unquestionably. But in the long term, relying on Western guardians can go only so far without addressing the challenges in Asia itself.
Another possibility, often overlooked, is to contemplate some sort of a political alliance between the Hong Kong protesters and the actual people of mainland China. Tsai claims that “1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united” in their opposition to the protests, but in truth it is almost impossible for us, as outside spectators, to understand the real situation, as state-backed social media is quick to punish dissenting opinions. Nevertheless, we know there are plenty of PRC citizens living abroad who are freely voicing criticism of the Hong Kong police, and reports from journalists based in China also paint a more complicated picture. Both in person and online, Kiki Tianqi Zhao reports, Chinese citizens are privately expressing a diversity of opinions toward Hong Kong, “from admiration to disdain, confusion, and even indifference.”
As unrealistic as it may sound today, it is possible that the best hope for Hong Kong protesters to make a lasting impact is not to look halfway around the world but to somehow make their demands resonate with people in China as well, particularly with those feeling the same material squeeze as the Hong Kong youth are. This would require elevating certain aspects of the protests over others. There is a prominent pro-liberal strand among protesters who view themselves as more Western than Asian; these were the people with whom Morey—a Romney voter with a private equity background who is hardly anyone’s idea of a social radical—was expressing solidarity. The flipside to this sentiment, though, is a well-documented nativism directed against mainland Chinese visitors, mocking their poverty and their supposedly crass and vulgar behavior. Both are politically shortsighted.
A more hopeful avenue is to imagine the links between working people located across political boundaries yet united in their dreams for better material living conditions. Hong Kong–based unions and NGOs have helped shine a light on worker grievances in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong Province, just over the border, which serves as China’s “workshop to the world.” Last fall, unionizing efforts at Jasic Technology, a Shenzhen-based welding parts company, drew sympathy from across Asia. And this spring, technology workers in China used the platform GitHub to disseminate a public campaign against the pressure for overwork in China, known as “996 culture” (working 9 to 9, 6 days per week), garnering support worldwide. Others, meantime, have written about the possibility of mutual understanding, even solidarity, between PRC and Hong Kong students living overseas in more permissive environments. Last month, Shan Windscript documented examples of solidarity from mainland students studying in Sydney, Australia.
More generally, it is a fact that the economic development of China could not have taken place without Hong Kong, and vice versa. Even today, the city retains no small amount of leverage, as it is still the “lungs through which Chinese banks breathe.” If the economic fates of the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese people remain connected, then it makes sense that positive transformations for one will necessarily require change for the other.
For those of us on the outside, it’s important that in our sympathy for the protests we resist the temptation to portray China as a country of 1.4 billion people blindly parroting the official line. This is a fiction being wielded by both the patriotic Tsai and some of the liberal critics of the NBA. In the words of the New York Times, “There is no freedom of speech, thought, assembly, religion, movement or any semblance of political liberty in China.” This latter sentiment stems from the classic playbook of anti-Communist Orientalism, which depicts the Chinese state as an unchanging, “autocratic,” “authoritarian,” “totalitarian,”and “Communist” despot and its people as a herdlike population in need of rescue by outside saviors. Such portrayals ignore the possibility of disagreement within China itself. Ironically, in painting a picture of national unity, they do the PRC officials’ work for them, as Zhao points out. When nationalistic journalists in the US suggest that NBA players and managers must stand up for the “Western” values of democracy and human rights against illiberal China, they only play into the hands of the PRC’s media strategy. Party mythology there hinges on the conceit that the protests in Hong Kong are really a contest between true Chinese patriots and foreign meddlers such as Morey. It overshadows the possibility of a larger political principle that could appeal to broader audiences across the border separating the two societies.

We Found Some Clues.,David Corn,MotherJones,Corruption,"When the US attorney for the Southern District of New York charged two associates of Rudy Giuliani and two other men on Wednesday with campaign finance violations, the indictment contained a big mystery.
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman—who had been helping Giuliani search for dirt on Joe Biden and the Democrats in Ukraine—and David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, who were each identified as businessmen, were charged in what seems to be overlapping capers. Parnas and Fruman allegedly made secret donations to Republicans in an effort to advance their business interests and promote the agenda of one or more Ukrainian officials (which included firing the US ambassador to Ukraine). And these two Giuliani confederates also teamed up with Correia, a business partner of Parnas, and Kukushkin and allegedly made donations secretly financed by a Russian national to Republican candidates for state offices in Nevada to buy influence they could use to set up a cannabis business there. This Russian, who would be part of their legal marijuana venture, sent $1 million from overseas accounts to Fruman that was to be used for contributions to federal and state candidates in Nevada and other states, according to the indictment. It’s illegal for a foreigner to funnel donations to US candidates.
The mystery: Who is this wealthy Russian who allegedly tried to make illegal contributions to US politicians in pursuit of launching a cannabis venture?
The indictment does not say. It refers to this individual only as “Foreign National-1.” And the question cannot be yet answered definitively. But California state records and emails obtained by Mother Jones indicate that a Russian businessman named Andrey Muraviev had previously worked with Kukushkin to develop a cannabis enterprise.
In 2016, Kukushkin and Muraviev joined with a Sacramento businessman named Garib Karapetyan, who has been involved in the recreational marijuana business, to create a corporation called Legacy Botanical Company LLC, which was listed at a Sacramento address, according to a filing with the secretary of state in California. (Two years earlier, Karapetyan lost an arbitration case filed by Philip Morris USA after he registered the domain name marijuanamarlboros.com.) In emails Kukushkin sent in 2016 and 2017, he described his desire to acquire medical cannabis dispensaries in California and engage in other legal pot projects. In one email, he cc’d Alexander Mikhalev, whose LinkedIn profile identifies him as the chief financial officer of Parus Capital, a fund that Muraviev established in 2008. In another email, Kukushkin expressed interest in developing cultivation facilities in Northern California’s Sonoma County and referenced “contributions” he was willing to make to win licenses to run cannabis businesses there.
One cannabis business consultant in California tells Mother Jones that Kukushkin, while he was seeking investment opportunities in the cannabis field in California and Oregon, said he was representing “a large agricultural and materials businessman from Russia” and identified him as Andrey Muraviev.
Muraviev does not have much of a public profile in the United States. His Wikipedia page says he was born in 1974. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, he graduated from Kemerovo State Technical University in 1997 with an economics degree and also graduated from San Francisco State University in 1998 with a finance degree. He is the founder of Sibir Cement, one of Russia’s largest cement companies. It has facilities across Siberia. As of 2012, his Parus Capital, a Russia-dedicated investment fund, had $50 million to invest. The fund, according to his Wikipedia page, finances “food production, the IT industry, real estate, and in construction of new cement plants.” Muraviev has also been a director of QIWI, a publicly traded Russian electronic payment service provider that is headquartered in Cyprus. His names is sometimes spelled “Muravyev” or “Muravyov.”
In 2012, an investment group filed a complaint with the Russian government contending that Muraviev and others had engaged in wrongdoing related to a development company that had gone bankrupt; its claims included the accusation that Muraviev and associates had drawn funds out of the company for their own “illicit enrichment.” It could not be determined if this complaint was ever investigated or confirmed by the Russian government.
Mikhalev, the CFO of Parus Capital, did not respond to a request for comment.
The indictment states that in early September 2018, Parnas, Fruman, Correia, Kukushkin, and the Russian national met in Las Vegas to discuss their business venture and that “shortly after that” the four Americans “began to formalize” their deal with the Russian to “fund their lobbying efforts.” But, it adds, they “took steps to hide” the Russian’s involvement in the venture and in any “political contributions associated” with the project. That was due to, as Kukushkin supposedly put it, their backer’s “Russian roots and current political paranoia about it.” (On September 14, 2018, Kukushkin and Correia formed a company in Nevada called Strategic Investment Group.)
According to the indictment, the cannabis venture went nowhere. Kukushkin and his associates failed to apply for a recreational marijuana license in Nevada by September 2018, the then-deadline. At the end of October 2018, Kukushkin told the Russian they were “2 months too late to the game unless we change the rules,” but he added that contributions—covertly funded by the Russian—to a particular Nevada state official could lead to the “green light to implement this.” The indictment cites two $10,000 contributions this group made to Nevada candidates using the Russian’s money. And these donations appear to have gone to Adam Laxalt and Wesley Duncan, then the Republican candidates for governor and attorney general. They each lost in the election that year.
The indictment says that Parnas, Fruman, Correia, and the Russian continued to meet into the spring of 2019, but no project ever materialized.
It’s not clear if Muraviev is the Russian cited in the indictment. Perhaps Kukushkin has worked with more than one wealthy Russian businessman eager to enter the American pot market. For now, Kukushkin is not talking, according to his lawyer. Neither are Parnas, Fruman, and Correia. And so far, not a single Russian has come forward to claim credit for underwriting the alleged criminal activity of Giuliani’s dirt-digging pals and their comrades.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Gavin Newsom declared private prisons an “outrage” and promised to end them “once and for all.” Today, he signed the strictest private prison ban in the country, setting the stage for thousands of immigration detainees and prisoners to be transferred out of facilities operated by for-profit corporations.
The move comes as major banks are abandoning the private prison industry, Democratic presidential candidates are calling to abolish it, and outrage is mounting over its role in facilitating President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies.
Like similar private prison bans in New York, Illinois, Iowa, and Nevada, the California law will prohibit the state’s corrections department from signing new contracts with private prison companies or extending existing ones. But California’s version goes further, banning all for-profit detention facilities from operating inside state lines—including four major Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers.
“We are sending a powerful message that we vehemently oppose the practice of profiteering off the backs of Californians in custody,” the bill’s author, state representative Rob Bonta of Alameda County, said in a statement. “We are committed to humane treatment for all.”
The law will end the California corrections system’s experiment with private prisons, which accelerated in 2009 when a federal court ordered the state to reduce dangerous overcrowding in its prison system. As part of its overhaul of its criminal justice system, the state sent some of its prisoners to a handful of private prisons, including facilities in other states. But over the last few years, as the state’s prison population has fallen, it has gradually moved inmates out of private prisons and into state-operated facilities.
As of June, about 2,222 prisoners—less than 2 percent of California’s roughly 125,000 inmates—remained in four private facilities operated by the GEO Group, the country’s largest private prison company. Two weeks ago, the state corrections department announced it was removing inmates from the Central Valley Modified Community Correctional Facility. The remaining three private prisons are expected to close by 2023, at their end of their current contracts, though the new law allows them to continue to be used if needed to comply with a court-ordered cap on the state’s prison population.
The new ban’s more immediate effects could be felt next year, when contracts expire for major federal immigration detention centers with space to detain up to 4,500 people. GEO’s Adelanto and Mesa Verde detention centers are currently operating under temporary contracts that expire in March 2020; ICE’s contract for Otay Mesa, a CoreCivic detention center outside San Diego, will expire that June. An ICE spokesperson told the Sacramento Bee the agency plans to transfer its California detainees to other states if the ban takes effect. “The impact of such a state law would be felt almost exclusively by residents of California who would be forced to travel greater distances to visit friends and family in custody,” she said.
The ban may first have to survive a legal challenge. In July, the state Senate’s judiciary committee predicted that the Trump administration will sue the state for infringing on federal immigration law and contractual obligations, and it guessed that California would prevail in such a suit.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But this defeat came despite a dissent from one of Trump’s more radical judicial appointees who showed a willingness to limit Congress’ investigative powers and overturn Supreme Court precedent in order to protect the president—going so far as to claim that Congress could only investigate the president if it had declared an impeachment inquiry.
“Investigations of impeachable offenses simply are not, and never have been, within Congress’s legislative power,” Judge Neomi Rao wrote in her dissent.
As soon as the DC Circuit Court of Appeals three-judge panel released its decision, Rao’s dissent shocked the legal community. Former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration Neal Katyal called it “whackadoodle,” “nutso,” and “profoundly antidemocratic.”
“Rao’s dissent is extraordinary,” tweeted Elizabeth Wydra, the president of the Constitution Accountability Center, a progressive legal group that filed a brief in support of the House Democrats’ case. It “ignores that Congress has very broad authority to investigate—far beyond the power of impeachment—and seems to suggest that courts have some say over the scope of impeachable offenses (they don’t).”
Trump may appeal to the US Supreme Court, but even legal experts who believe that the current conservative majority on the US Supreme Court is too deferential to Trump have expressed doubt that a majority of the justices will side with Rao. But whatever comes next, Rao’s dissent remains a warning to Democrats of the fact that Trump has filled the judiciary with judges who he believes will protect him from investigations. As Newt Gingrich said last year when asked if the courts would force Trump to disclose his tax returns—the very issue in this case—”we’ll see whether or not the [Supreme Court Justice Brett] Kavanaugh fight was worth it.”
This spring, the House Oversight and Reform Committee issued a subpoena to Trump’s accounting firm requesting eight years of his tax returns. The committee issued the subpoena following testimony from Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen. Congress has broad authority to launch investigations and issue subpoenas in order to fulfill its legislative purpose. Trump, in his personal capacity, sued the committee to block the subpoena, arguing that it lacked a “legitimate legislative purpose”—that the Congress’ purported purpose was invalid because it was a cover to investigate Trump. The majority opinion from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed this idea.
But Rao did not. In her dissent, she argued that Congress cannot investigate a president for criminal conduct unless it has launched an impeachment investigation—and even then, seemed to buck historical and Supreme Court precedent to argue that the courts may determine when an impeachment inquiry is valid. “The House cannot target conduct that could constitute a high crime or misdemeanor through the legislative power,” Rao writes, essentially asserting—without citing supporting law or precedent—that when a congressional investigation bumps  into the possibility of serious misconduct by the president it must stop its investigation and instead open an impeachment inquiry.
Rao, who filled the appellate seat vacated when Brett Kavanaugh was elevated to the Supreme Court last year, is a former Trump administration official who worked on deregulation during her stint in the White House. Her record came under scrutiny during her confirmation, including her reactionary college writings which pilloried feminists, environmentalists, multiculturalism, and affirmative action. Her dissent in this case showed a willingness to bust through past precedent and create new law to grow the power of the executive branch. Despite the growing understanding that recent presidents, including George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Trump have continuously expanded the power of the executive, Rao’s dissent openly worries that it is the legislative branch whose powers the majority of the court is recklessly expanding. “Allowing the Committee to issue this subpoena for legislative purposes,” she wrote, “would turn Congress into a roving inquisition over a co-equal branch of government.”
Rao’s dissent makes the case that Congress cannot investigate possible criminal wrongdoing by a president unless it has begun an impeachment inquiry. “Allegations of illegal conduct against the President cannot be investigated by Congress except through impeachment,” she wrote. Under this logic, no investigation could touch illegal actions by a president unless Congress first announced an impeachment investigation—forcing the legislative branch to pursue impeachment merely to carry out its basic inquiries and legislation-related investigations that touch on the president.
“The dissent would reorder the very structure of the Constitution,” Judge David Tatel, a Bill Clinton appointee, wrote in his majority opinion. “Throughout history, the Constitution has left to Congress the judgment whether to commence the impeachment process. But the dissent’s approach would not even allow Congress to make the quintessentially legislative judgment that some concerns about potential misconduct or illegality are better addressed through oversight and legislation than impeachment.”
But even if Congress declared an impeachment investigation, Rao hints in her dissent that she believes courts should have the authority to find Congress’ investigative subpoenas invalid. Though impeachment is a political process determined entirely by Congress—as the Supreme Court has previously affirmed—Rao states that the Constitution limits the offenses for which a president can be impeached.
The implications for this are extraordinary: Rao contemplates that the courts may have the power to step in and limit or otherwise declare invalid an impeachment inquiry. The logical conclusion of Rao’s dissent is thus a catch-22 that strips Congress of both its power to investigate and to impeach: If Congress wants to investigate possible criminal violations by the president, even for legislative reasons, it must first open an impeachment investigation—yet if such an investigation is not considered valid by the courts, the subpoenas and the impeachment effort more generally can be voided by judges.
This is, of course, the Trump administration’s goal. His lawyers have similarly argued in recent days that the impeachment investigation is invalid, as are Congress’ subpoenas. It’s unclear how many judges Trump has appointed who agree with him, but this case—and several others over Congressional subpoenas—will test whether more of his judicial picks, including his two appointees to the Supreme Court, are willing to kneecap Congress’ investigatory powers. In Rao, Trump has at least one.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The “public charge” rule, which was set to take effect on Tuesday, would deny green cards to immigrants deemed likely to use public benefits, to which they are legally entitled.
District court judge George Daniels was unusually critical of the arguments the Justice Department used to justify radically reinterpreting what it means to be a public charge, a part of federal immigration law that dates back to 1882. “In short,” Daniels wrote, “defendants do not articulate why they are changing the public charge definition, why this new definition is needed now, or why the definition set forth in the Rule—which has absolutely no support in the history of U.S. immigration law—is reasonable.” (A California district judge court issued a second injunction on Friday that, unlike Daniels’, does not apply nationwide.)
Daniels wrote that the rule released by the Department of Homeland Security in August “is simply a new agency policy of exclusion in search of a justification.” He continued, “It is repugnant to the American Dream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work and upward mobility.”
The public charge rule could deny green cards to hundreds of thousands of immigrants and may wind up being the Trump administration’s most significant attack on legal immigration. Immigrants without permanent residency are already ineligible for most forms of public assistance. Instead, the rule targets people immigration officials decide are likely to use benefits in the future for 12 months of a 36-month period. They are directed to make that decision based on factors including an immigrant’s age, income, health, education, and credit score. It’s still not clear how that would work in practice.
Congress has made clear that permanent residents are eligible to receive public benefits, usually after they’ve had green cards for five years. Daniels argued that it makes no sense to punish immigrants for being likely to use those benefits. “Under the Rule, although this individual is legally entitled to public housing, if she takes advantage of this right, she may be penalized with denial of adjustment of status,” he concluded. “There is no logic to this framework.” Daniels made clear that the new standard would cause significant harm, writing, “Overnight, the Rule will expose individuals to economic insecurity, health instability, denial of their path to citizenship, and potential deportation.”
The judge was particularly critical of a section of the rule that penalizes immigrants who do not speak English. “The United States of America has no official language,” Daniels noted. “Many, if not most, immigrants who arrived at these shores did not speak English. It is simply offensive to contend that English proficiency is a valid predictor of self-sufficiency.”
Earlier on Friday, the White House sent out a press released titled, “Activist Judicial Rulings Block the Administration From Enforcing Our Nation’s Immigration Laws.” Now it has one more decision to add to the list.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Gavin Newsom put California public utility Pacific Gas & Electric on blast Thursday while the company worked to slowly restore power to the more than one million people affected by its planned blackouts. Strong wind forecasts during hot, dry weather—ideal conditions for the wildfires that have plagued the state in recent years—prompted PG&E to preemptively cut electricity across Central and Northern California. Though climate change certainly at play in the uptick in powerful wildfires, Newsom primarily cast blame on the utility company for poor management that he says has left California with a “false choice…between public safety and hardship.”
“This is not from my perspective a climate change story as much as it is a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades,” Newsom said. “[It is about] neglect, and a desire to protect not public safety but profits.”

Despite the tough talk, California lawmakers have protected PG&E to some extent. Last year, then-Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill many considered to be a “bailout” that could allow the utility to recover some of its liability costs from 2017 wildfires by ultimately charging customers on their monthly bills.
In a press conference in Sacramento, Newsom said that PG&E neglected to improve and maintain the electric grid for decades, which led to the devastating Camp and Woolsey fires in Northern and Southern California in 2018 and ultimately bankrupted the company.
“What has occurred in the last 48 hours is unacceptable,” Newsom said. “Parents who can’t bathe their kids, folks that come home from work and can’t even find a way to get into their garage; you’ve got people who can’t even access water or medical supplies. We’re seeing a scale and scope of something that no state in the 21st century should experience.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

If you thought “a podcast,” have I got a new audio product for you. Sonny Perdue, former bumbling governor of Georgia and current bumbling secretary of the US Department of Agriculture under President Donald Trump, has launched The Sonnyside of the Farm. The podcast’s literally corny USDA landing page promises that Perdue will hold forth with guests on “issues facing America’s farmers, ranchers, producers and foresters today.”
From that description, you might expect to hear about Trump’s trade war with China, which has tanked soybean prices and inspired the administration to deliver $28 billion (and counting) in cash handouts to farmers, more than double the total price tag for the previous administration’s auto industry bailout. Or about the fury of corn growers at the administration’s recent ethanol policies. Or maybe even the climate chaos that has roiled farmers from the Midwest to the Southeast this year.
But in Sonnyside‘s maiden voyage, dropped a week after the House of Representatives announced an impeachment inquiry against Trump, the secretary mostly dispenses with the ag talk. His first guest is neither farmer, nor rancher, nor producer, nor forester. Rather, she is Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a career political operative now openly contemplating a run for Arkansas governor, best known for her stint as Trump’s extremely loyal press secretary. Perdue and Sanders chatted in Little Rock, and it’s worth a listen:

They open with a bit of mutual admiration. Sanders: “The president is so lucky to have you out there fighting for him.” Perdue: “I don’t think anybody fought harder than you did, and everyone admires the service you gave to the administration and the president.” After that, Perdue turns his flattery onto Sanders’ father, Trump loyalist and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, whom Perdue describes as his “good friend,” a “man of the people,” and a “wonderful communicator for our values and our way of life.”
Then the two get down to business: lavishing praise on Trump, who they paint as a gruff but big-hearted leader who “loves this country” (Sanders) and “has an amazing instinctive ability to make decisions” (Perdue). Sanders makes the case that the self-evident virtues of Trump’s adult children demonstrate his greatness. They have all enjoyed “tremendous individual success” apart from their father’s business and political exploits, she insists, and yet they have “sacrificed” their personal interests to serve his administration, because they “believe in their dad, believe in their country, and want to see great things continue to happen through his leadership.” That sentiment inspires Perdue to marvel about just how much Trump “loves America.” He continues: “He doesn’t apologize for America, and that inspires me as a citizen, as a United States citizen of the United States of America—you can question the way he does things from time to time, but you cannot question his love for this country.”
Then Sanders veers toward a relevant topic: the trade war with China. After acknowledging that “we’re taking some minor economic hits” from the hostilities, she opines that China can’t “continue to come in and rip us off,” and that “at some point we have to decide who’s going to be the leader of the world, and this president has decided that as long as he’s president, it’s going to be the United States.”
That settled, the two lament, as Sanders puts it, that “the media is completely biased and out to get this president.” This insight prompts Perdue to ask what the president is really like. Here’s a snippet of Sanders’ response:
As for Trump’s rough edges, those come from his background as a titan of New York City real estate, they conclude. That insight leads Perdue to marvel about “how in the world” someone from such an urban background could have developed “such a sincere affection for farmers and ranchers—time after time after it amazes me how he identifies with our agricultural community.” Sanders then theorizes that Trump’s affection for toilers of the earth stems from the fact that they “make something.” In his real estate days, she claims, Trump favored the company of construction workers and tradespeople over that of architects and engineers, because they got stuff done. (They neglect to mention Trump’s record of stiffing his suppliers.)
And on it goes: two superfans comparing notes on the virtues of their idol, while dismissing any possible foibles with a chuckle.
Given that the podcast is an official product of the USDA and features the agency’s secretary talking up Trump with the president’s former campaign adviser/spokesperson, I wondered: Was it a de facto campaign commercial, made on the taxpayer’s dime, and promoted by a federal department? And if so, did it run afoul of campaign law?
I put that question to Kathleen Clark, professor of law at Washington University, an expert on campaign finance law. “Of course a government department can have a communication function,” she said, but the communication material should serve the interest of the public. “This particular episode with Huckabee Sanders confuses me,” she continued. “What public interest does it serve? How does it have to do with the mission of the USDA?”
The department’s stated mission is to provide “leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on public policy, the best available science, and effective management.” Perdue and his first guest discuss none of that, and Sanders has no background in farming or agriculture policy.
Clark said that even though Trump is locked in a fierce reelection campaign, and Sanders is openly contemplating a run for Arkansas governor, the podcast episode doesn’t violate campaign finance law because no electoral issues are directly discussed. She wondered, though, about the use of funds appropriated by Congress on a communications product that had nothing to do with the department’s mission.
I reached out to the staffs of several Congress members on the House and Senate agriculture committees, which appropriate funds for the USDA’s operations, to get their thoughts. None would talk on the record. One Democratic staffer agreed to be quoted anonymously. The staffer called the podcast a “pretty naked attempt at damage control in farm country, but I don’t know if that runs afoul of appropriations law per se,” because the administration can “argue that past secretaries have worked as ambassadors for their White Houses, and this one is the first to utilize the podcasting technology to do that.” The takeaway, the staffer said, is that “it’s a clear recognition by the administration that there is damage to control” among Trump’s rural base.
As for me, I’m hooked on the Sonnyside of the Farm podcast, and will be listening closely. According to the USDA website, Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, will be an upcoming guest. The Farm Bureau is a massive nonprofit insurance conglomerate closely allied with the agrichemical industry, and a major lobbying force in Washington. Duval recently attended a White House event announcing a trade deal with Japan, and was called out by Trump:

Trump’s Lawyers Will Be Happy.,Pema Levy,MotherJones,Politics,"Congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump are in a stand-off over impeachment, with Democrats requesting documents and interviews from the executive branch and the administration defying those requests by citing executive privilege and declaring Congress’ investigations invalid. It’s a constitutional clash with one all-but-inevitable end point: The Supreme Court.
In order to conduct an impeachment inquiry and come to a decision about whether Trump has committed offenses unbefitting of his office, Congress needs to consider evidence. In an inquiry focused on Ukraine, it would need testimony from individuals involved in diplomacy there and others at the White House. But the administration is stonewalling by blocking witnesses and ignoring subpoenas by asserting the president has a right to confidentiality in his conversations with advisers, and more broadly alleging that the House’s impeachment investigation is an unconstitutional political vendetta.
Before the Ukraine scandal erupted, lawsuits over Congressional subpoenas seeking documents and testimony—some filed by Congress, others by the Trump administration—were already working their way through the courts. With an impeachment investigation now underway, the courts are facing unsettled constitutional questions. When a Congress taking up impeachment runs headlong into a president claiming executive privilege, which side prevails? When a Congress performing oversight runs into a president who claims that oversight is a fraud, who wins?
In almost every scenario, the president can expect victory. Even if he loses these cases at the Supreme Court, it may only be after a long judicial process that could run out the clock on impeachment, perhaps even past the 2020 elections. Even better for Trump would be if the court, guided by Chief Justice John Roberts, creates new precedent protecting the president, or decides the judicial branch shouldn’t get involved in impeachment decisions—a win by default that would allow Trump to continue to stonewall.
“There is no case of the Supreme Court that discusses the ability of the Congress to secure documents and testimony from the White House during an impeachment,” says Saikrishna Prakash, an expert on presidential authority at the University of Virginia School of Law. It’s unclear if the courts will view impeachment as altering the calculus in deciding cases that are fundamentally about the balance of power between two branches of government. The administration announced Tuesday that in addition to executive privilege claims, it would not cooperate with Congress’ impeachment inquiry, arguing that the probe itself is constitutionally invalid, a claim it is also making in a lawsuit against the House Ways and Means Committee’s attempt to obtain Trump’s tax returns. The brewing battle over Congress’s requests could give Roberts, a conservative on a right-wing Supreme Court that is generally friendly to executive power, a chance to decide the question in a way that could hand a victory not only to Trump, but to future presidents.
During the Watergate investigation, the Supreme Court played a critical role by ordering President Richard Nixon to turn over tapes of his conversations to the special Watergate prosecutor—a decision that ultimately lead to Nixon’s resignation. But that case was not technically about impeachment; while Congress was simultaneously pursuing impeachment, the battle for the tapes pitted Nixon against the prosecutor. The question the court decided in that case was that a criminal probe outweighed executive privilege.
While Prakash suggests that because “impeachment is more important than criminal punishment,” the court may find that executive privilege “has to give way to the impeachment process as well,” he admits the court could go in another direction. One potential outcome is a holding that the court have no powers to intervene an impeachment investigation, and that the legislative branch’s only recourse is to fold evidence of obstruction into potential articles of impeachment.
“The impeachment context is a two-edged sword,” says Walter Dellinger, a former acting solicitor general during the Clinton administration. “It gives Congress a much broader justification for seeking documents and testimony than other contexts. And so theoretically, Congress is on more solid ground when it is exercising the powers of impeachment.” But, he adds, “it’s possible that courts would be more hesitant to intervene in support of congressional subpoenas in an impeachment context” and instead tell Congress that its quest for documents and testimony is a political battle to be worked out with the executive branch.
There is some precedent suggesting the court might take such a hands off approach, according to Dellinger, stemming from a 1993 decision involving a former federal judge named Walter Nixon, who had been impeached and removed from the bench for criminal behavior. He sued over the way the Senate conducted his impeachment trial, but in an unanimous decision, the Supreme Court said that it was not the job of the courts to determine how Congress conducts impeachment. “I think the court is going to be hesitant to intervene in an impeachment context,” says Dellinger.
Though Congressional Democrats have yet to sue to enforce the most recent subpoenas related to the president’s request that Ukraine investigate his political opponents, earlier demands for records are already mired in litigation. In federal district court in DC on Tuesday, an attorney representing the House Judiciary Committee as it seeks grand jury material from Robert Mueller’s investigation insisted that the request—which predated the official impeachment inquiry—was now part of that inquiry. The Justice Department has redacted some of the documents that it has agreed to share with the committee on grounds of executive privilege, teeing up a fresh battle between a president’s right to confidentiality and Congress’ authority to investigate. The courts will likely consider this case and other contests over evidence under the umbrella of impeachment.
The Trump administration seems eager to resist all the way to the Supreme Court, as they’ve made bold legal claims about executive power and privilege that seem designed to entice the nation’s highest court to weigh in. In the fight over grand jury testimony in court on Tuesday, for example, the judge seemed surprised when the Justice Department argued that the courts had erred by allowing Congress to see key grand jury testimony during Watergate that was integral to the House’s eventual impeachment resolution.
The strategy appears designed to generate long-running court battles that could help Trump run out the clock. The administration’s attempts to withhold information that isn’t clearly shielded by executive privilege—like the president’s tax returns, grand jury information, and other records—are weak, and courts regularly side with Congress when it comes to enforcing such subpoenas. “On almost any of this stuff, for them to rule in favor of the administration or in favor of Trump… it would require a fairly significant deviation from existing principles,” says Josh Chafetz, an expert on the separation of powers at Cornell Law School.
But a victory on these relatively settled matters wouldn’t matter much if Trump’s lawyers ensure it comes too late for the documents or testimony to be considered for impeachment or by voters ahead of the 2020 election. It took seven years, for example, for House Republicans to win a court battle with the Obama administration over documents involved in the Fast and Furious scandal. If Trump is able to force even weak cases as high as the Supreme Court, that alone could cause a delay long enough for his purposes.
A pivotal moment in Congress’ impeachment investigation came last week with former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker’s testimony, accompanied by critical Whatsapp messages containing evidence of a quid pro quo that is damning to the president. House Democrats seem to understand that the slow pace of the courts—and the conservative makeup of this Supreme Court—may work against them in forcing future testimony. Last week they informed witnesses, including Rudy Giuliani, that refusal to comply with subpoenas may be included in future articles of impeachment.
Volker’s cooperation with the probe shows such a threat to be a pitiful alternative to actually acquiring documents and testimony. Without more such evidence, lawmakers will be forced to decide to make the serious decision whether to remove a president without a fuller picture of his wrongdoing and to consider moving forward with charges focused on obstruction. But there is already bountiful evidence in Mueller’s final report that Trump tried to obstruct that and other federal investigations, refusing to turn over certain evidence or consent to an interview, yet that did not galvanize action on impeachment.
Chafetz believes that Congress’ best option—particularly given the slow pace of the judicial process—is to use powers that it has thus far refused to consider and attempt to adjust the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches. The Trump administration’s refusal to comply with nearly every congressional request has highlights how the executive branch is expanding its power while the legislative branch has allowed its authority to shrink. “It shows the weakness of Congress when they go running to the courts,” says Chafetz. “The idea that an administration might completely ignore what a house of Congress wants but would never ignore an order from a judge—that too just goes to show the weakness of Congress.”
The author of a recent book on Congress’ enforcement powers, Chafetz argues House Democrats should wield the power of the purse to deny funding for, as an example, the White House counsel’s office. “I’d like to see them be more aggressive on these things,” Chafetz says. Congress also has the power to arrest and jail people it holds in contempt, but it has not arrested an executive branch official in more than a century.
“Congress generally wins these fights” over subpoenas, Chafetz says. “The problem is it always wins way too late to actually matter.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Follow along for all the latest.
8:26 p.m. ET: It’s official: Former South Carolina congressman Trey Gowdy, who oversaw the two-yearlong Benghazi probe, is finding a second life as an outsider attorney for President Donald Trump in the wake of the House impeachment inquiry, the New York Times reported on Wednesday night. Just days ago, Gowdy, as a Fox News pundit on The Story with Martha MacCallum, accused Rep. Adam Schiff of “mishandling this investigation.” CNBC reported earlier today that Fox cut ties with Gowdy.

8:16 p.m. ET: Donald Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, in his capacity as a freelance diplomat, has played a central role in the effort to drum up a Ukraine investigation into the Bidens. Now here comes Bloomberg News with a report about the president trying to help one of Giuliani’s clients before the former NYC mayor was the president’s attorney.
During an Oval Office meeting in 2017, Trump asked former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to work with the Justice Department to drop a criminal case against Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who had been charged in a sanctions evasion scheme. Zarrab was represented by Giuliani (He later pleaded guilty and cooperated with US prosecutors.) Giuliani told Bloomberg that he’d been talking with US officials “as part of his effort to arrange a swap of Zarrab for Andrew Brunson, an American pastor jailed in Turkey.” As Bloomberg points out, Zarrab’s release was considered a “high priority” for Turkey’s authoritarian leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Bloomberg reports:
Don’t miss the part where Giuliani initially denies to Bloomberg having ever raised Zarrab’s case with Trump, only to say moments later, “Suppose I did talk to Trump about it—so what? I was a private lawyer at the time.”
7:15 p.m. ET: Even a majority of Americans polled by the president’s favorite cable network think he should be impeached. A new Fox News poll found that 51 percent of registered voters now supported President Donald Trump’s impeachment and removal from office—a nine-point uptick from July. Four percent thought the president should be impeached but not removed. We’ll see whether the president still thinks “just 25 percent of people want the President impeached.”

FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver points out that the Fox News poll “is going to cause a wee bit of anxiety in the White House.”

7:00 p.m. ET: During a gaggle with reporters in Iowa, Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly danced around a straight answer when asked if he was aware of a key connection in the Trump-Ukraine scandal: whether the military aid to Ukraine was being held up until the country promised to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
Instead, Pence told reporters he “never discussed the issue” with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and then he echoed Trump’s call for an investigation into debunked claims about the Bidens. “The issue of aid and our efforts with regard to Ukraine were from my experience in no way connected to the very legitimate concern the American people had about corruption that took place,” Pence said, per NBC’s Vaughn Hillyard.

6:25 p.m. ET: We know that if the House decided to impeach President Donald Trump, the Senate would have to hold a trial and determine whether to expel him from office. But what if a senator was impeached?
More than 200 years ago, on July 7, 1797, the House impeached Sen. William Blount of Tennessee for his involvement in a ploy to seize “Spanish Florida and Louisiana with British and Indian help,” according to the US Senate Historical Office.
As Smithsonian pointed out in 2017, the Senate eventually voted to get rid of Blount but later narrowly voted against a resolution that declared Blount an “impeachable officer.” That left open the question of whether the Senate can put a colleague on trial. Read more about it here.
3:55 p.m. ET: Yesterday the New York Times reported that the CIA whistleblower wrote in a memo that a White House official called Trump’s July conversation with the president of Ukraine “crazy,” “frightening” and “completely lacking in substance related to national security.” CBS News has obtained a description of the full text of the memo. Read it here.

2:02 p.m. ET: Joe Biden is now on board with impeachment. Biden, whom Trump urged the president of Ukraine to investigate in a now-infamous July phone call, had stopped short of calling for impeachment in the past. On the day that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the official inquiry, he said he would support impeachment if the White House refused to deliver the whistleblower report to Congress. The proximate reason for Biden’s finally throwing in with the impeachment crowd is Trump’s continued stonewalling of the House inquiry, though you wonder. As The New Republic‘s Osita Nwanevu notes, one casualty of the impeachment process has been the Biden campaign’s specious premise that the former vice president could restore bipartisan comity to politics.

12:49 p.m. ET: It would take a real feat of selective reasoning to read the Washington Post‘s latest impeachment survey as positive for Donald Trump—but in logical gymnastics, Trump is not to be outdone. The Post found that 58 percent of Americans support House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, including 25 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Trump construed this to mean that only 25 percent of Americans want him impeached. (Wanting the president impeached, it should be noted, is different from supporting an impeachment inquiry.)

Noon ET: Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, ups the anti-Democrat rhetoric by referring to the impeachment inquiry as a “coup.”

10:45 a.m. ET: House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said in a statement Wednesday that President Donald Trump “betrayed our nation” by encouraging the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter—to say nothing of his attempts to stonewall House Democrats’ impeachment investigation.
Earlier in the morning, Trump was at it again, taking to his preferred medium of Twitter to pile on more attacks against the whistleblower.

Sponsored by a Prison Company. At a Trump Resort.,Stephanie Mencimer,MotherJones,Politics,"Last year, a group of far-right fringe agitators and conspiracy theorists set out to create a pro-Trump political conference in DC for people just like them. Headliners for the American Priority Conference included Trump whisperer Roger Stone, before he was indicted for lying to Congress, and short-lived Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. But the event at the Washington Marriott Wardman Park proved to be an embarrassing flop, with attendance so dismal that one scheduled speaker fled rather than address such a small audience. Undeterred, organizers this year have taken a new approach by moving the event from DC to the Trump National Doral Miami Golf Club in Florida.
Relocating to a property owned by the president seems to have transformed the conference, which starts Thursday, into a bona fide political confab. It has attracted some more prominent speakers this year, notably the president’s son Donald Trump Jr., who will stand for selfies with anyone who pays the VIP rate of $2,500 to attend. But American Priority also seems to have nabbed the support of the sort of a big corporate patron that was missing from its 2018 fringe-fest. GEO Group, a Florida-based private prison company that has received nearly half a billion dollars in federal contracts to detain immigrants since President Trump took office, is now listed as one of its most prominent sponsors.
Holding functions at a Trump-owned property has become de rigueur for interest groups, from payday lenders to the Saudis, looking to influence the administration, and GEO Group is no exception. The country’s largest private prison company relies heavily on federal largesse. More than 40 percent of its revenue comes from federal contracts, and it has taken a number of steps to ingratiate itself with the Trump administration. During the presidential campaign, a GEO Group subsidiary donated $225,000 to a pro-Trump super-PAC. After Trump was elected, the company donated $250,000 to Trump’s inaugural committee and moved its annual meeting to Doral. And now, it’s helping a pro-Trump group spend some money there.
A press release for the American Priority Conference touted the new location of the event with as many superlatives as it did for any of the major headliners. “Doral Resort offers an experience like no other with unbeatable savings and luxurious accommodations on a prestigious 800-acre resort in tropical Miami,” it read. “The $250 million renovation boasts a completely re-designed clubhouse, 643 new deluxe accommodations, fresh restaurant concepts, enhanced championship golf courses, re-imagined Trump Spa and an array of retail shops and recreational amenities, including the Royal Palm Pool oasis.”
The Doral is the single largest source of revenue for the Trump Organization, the president’s company that is currently run by his children. But the golf club’s operating revenue has fallen sharply since Trump first entered the presidential race, declining by 18 percent between 2015 and 2017, according to the Washington Post. Trump has been accused of using his office to shore up the resort’s flagging fortunes. During a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron at the G7 meeting of world leaders in France in August, Trump publicly suggested that when the US hosts the meeting next year, the event might be at the Doral.
“It’s got tremendous acreage, many hundreds of acres, so we can handle whatever happens,” Trump said, calling the Doral a “great place” and touting its proximity to the airport. “We have a series of magnificent buildings, we call them bungalows, they each hold from 50 to 70 rooms, they have magnificent views.”
Critics responded to Trump’s suggestion that the world leaders meet at his own resort, where he would personally profit from their visits, by using social media to highlight a lawsuit against the Doral over bedbugs that was settled in 2016. The #TrumpBedBugs campaign infuriated the president, who tweeted “Radical Left Democrats” were to blame for spreading nasty rumors about one of his prized properties.
As the attraction of his properties diminishes with the president’s popularity, Trump needs companies like GEO Group to keep his resorts profitable. Meanwhile, GEO Group needs him. In 2016, President Barack Obama had ordered the Department of Justice to stop using private prisons, a decision that sent GEO Group’s stock plummeting 35 percent. But Trump quickly rolled back that policy, and since he took office, the prison giant has secured about $480 million in new contracts with ICE for immigrant detention, making ICE the company’s single largest source of income. In 2018, nearly 30 percent of its $2.33 billion in revenue flowed from ICE contracts.
But the company has become ever more reliant on the Trump administration’s generosity. Many major national banks have divested from private prisons because of criticism over their profiting from human rights abuses and the incarceration of immigrant children and families. Big banks are now refusing to extend loans to the company to finance its growth. GEO Group’s stock price has fallen about 30 percent since June, when JP Morgan Chase became the latest bank to announce it was abandoning the company.
Sponsoring the American Priority Conference at the Doral may win GEO Group favor with Trump, but it’s hardly an ideal model of corporate image burnishing. Despite the relatively mainstream headliner additions of Don Jr., former Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), the vast majority of people on the schedule for the three-day event hail from the right’s furthest fringes.
The event will feature a climate change denier as well as promoters of QAnon, an internet conspiracy that claims Trump is fighting the deep state to stop liberal elites they believe are running a secret pedophile ring. Tracy Beanz, who organized 100-plus QAnon believers to march on Washington last year, will be on a panel called “Unmasking the Russian Hoax,” along with George Papadopoulos. He’s the former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about the campaign’s contacts with Russia.
Conferencegoers will hear from the internet troll Jack Posobiec, who helped promote an earlier conspiracy theory that suggested Hillary Clinton and her henchmen were running a pedophile ring out of the basement of a DC pizza parlor. The idea inspired an armed North Carolina man to show up at Comet Ping Pong and fire shots as he searched for the nonexistent basement holding cell. The event will also feature a speech from “free speech maven” Jason Fyk, who sued Facebook after the social media giant killed his business by shutting down pages he’d created that were dedicated solely to videos and photos of people peeing. (He lost.)
Along with a golf tournament and pool parties, the conference schedule is packed with random people who’ve become minor internet celebs for owning the libs, like Scott Presler, a member of Gays for Trump who organized a trash cleanup day in Baltimore after Trump criticized the city as “a disgusting rat and rodent-infested mess.” Trump’s military high school platoon sergeant, now a Florida lawyer, is on the schedule to talk about taxes along with Trump superfan, radio host and QAnon promoter Bill Mitchell. Sadly, raw food advocate David “Avocado” Wolfe will no longer be leading the QAnon crowd through downward dog poses at daily yoga classes. Touted early on in the conference promo materials, Wolfe was perhaps even too fringy for the American Priority Conference. As The Outline explains, “Wolfe has stated that mushrooms arrived on our planet via the cosmic wind. He tells his followers vaccines are a conspiracy, and believes that chemtrails are real.” He’s no longer on the schedule.
All in all, it’s not the sort of event that corporate America tends to get behind—and it hasn’t. Most of the other sponsors are conservative political groups such as American Majority or small outfits like Republican Legion, which sells MAGA hats online. GEO Group did not respond to a request for comment. The American Priority Conference is organized by a low-profile Virginia conservative activist and telecom exec named Alex Phillips, who also did not respond to requests for comment; nor did the conference’s PR team.
At least one private prison opponent thinks GEO Group has nothing to fear from its sponsorship of the fringe conference. “This is a company that incarcerates people for the purpose of generating corporate profits,” says Alex Friedmann, associate director of the Human Rights Defense Center, a nonprofit advocacy group located near GEO Group headquarters in Florida. “They run facilities where people have been murdered. They house children in prison-like facilities. At this conference, all the other nutjobs should be embarrassed and ashamed to be associated with GEO Group, not the other way around.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Of the highest priority are the mountain yellow-legged frogs, which are endangered, the foothill yellow-legged frogs, which are under consideration to be listed as endangered, and the Puerto Rican crested toads, which are listed as threatened. The first two require air conditioning during the day, while the latter needs heat at night to survive, according to Darren Minier, assistant director of animal care, conservation, and research at the zoo, who spoke to me over the phone Wednesday after getting the last “loose ends tied up,” with a cockatoo named Jenny and an Amazon parrot named Brock squawking in the background. A generator “will kick on as soon as that building loses power,” he says, “so that we don’t injure those very sensitive species.”
As of 4 pm local time, the zoo had not yet lost power. It expected to lose power later Wednesday evening, around 8 pm local time, along with many other Bay Area residents.
The recent outages are the first time, says Minier, that the zoo has dealt with a loss of power at this scale since the 1989 earthquake that struck San Francisco and other parts of the Bay Area. The zoo was much smaller then and wasn’t badly affected. “I would definitely say this is our first sizable event since being built,” he says. “But, I mean, we plan for this.”
So far, more than 1 million people are estimated to have been affected by the power outages. The state’s largest power utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, intentionally scheduled the shutoff in an effort to prevent the spread of wildfires caused by malfunctioning equipment, but the loss of power has sent its customers into something of a scramble. Schools have canceled class, public transit has been delayed, and hardware stores have been picked clean of their generators.
Luckily for the rare frogs and toads, the zoo has more than 10 generators on site, meaning conditions for the animals, for the most part, won’t change when the power does actually go out. Problems start if the outage lasts longer than 24 hours, Minier says, when the animals’ perishable frozen food may need to be relocated offsite. If it lasts up to four to five days, as PG&E has said is possible, the generators will run out of gas and need to be refilled.
No animal will go without water during the power outage, but if it lasts longer than a day or two, some species whose water is refilled or filtered regularly—otters, alligators, Grizzlies—might have their tanks get a little grimy, according to Oakland Zoo CFO Nik Dehejia. “We have these filtration systems for animals…where we have re-circulating systems, and so we are looking at proactively turning those off, should it be needed, and the water quality will be compromised,” he says.
Luckily, this all means the zoo has things under control for now. But it might not be so lucky in the future. If the outages were happening in the chill of winter rather than the area’s warm fall, Minier says, finding supplemental heat for critters like their reptiles might have been a real challenge. (Unfortunately, that could be a possibility: California has two fire seasons. The hot months of June through September and the windier period between October and April.) And, of course, as wildfires may become more frequent as a result of climate change, power outages will likely become more and more difficult and expensive to cope with.
“We’ve been worried about earthquakes, obviously, in California,” Dehejia says. “And now it seems like we have to worry about wildfires just as much. This is becoming a new normal for us.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The effect of the dex is getting more unpredictable lately. This week, the dex crash came Wednesday morning, so I woke up, ate breakfast, and then went back to sleep until about lunchtime. I’ve been awake but drowsy ever since.
This is probably why the news seems even more dispiriting than usual. The Turks are rolling into Kurdish Syria and all Donald Trump has to say is, hey, the Kurds weren’t with us on the beaches of Normandy, so what kind of ally are they anyway? This has apparently finally gotten a rise from his evangelical fans, not because they care about the Kurds but because the Turks might end up killing some Christians too. I guess Trump forgot that the fate of Christians in the Middle East is a big deal to American evangelicals.
Here in California, the winds are picking up and PG&E is afraid that sparks from their electric lines might start a wildfire. You’d think the answer to this problem, in the greatest nation on earth, would be to install safer transformers and so forth, but I guess that’s beyond us. So instead they’re just shutting off electricity to a million people or so. Boo yah.
In other news, Ronan Farrow says Matt Lauer raped someone but NBC didn’t care. On the campaign trail, the yahoos are out in force, declaring their learned skepticism that any school in the 70s would decline to allow a pregnant woman to teach classes.

Splinter, the site formerly known as Fusion and staffed by some of the best human rights and labor reporters in the country, has ceased publication today. The site’s shuttering was announced in a very bad internal memo you can read parts of, if you can stomach the sanctimonious, paper-thin talking points.

Splinter excelled at skewering the timid reporting on competitor sites’ corporate platforms, calling out government lies (not a lie: I used to work there and wrote this takedown of Trump’s lies on Inauguration Day), and surveying the wreckage of a dying neoliberal order, with special attention paid to the labor rights movement, cruelty in prisons, and white fragility in party politics. The site was feral in the best sense.

The reality is that it’s mostly just a charging station with water and WiFi. About a dozen people idle at the folding tables Thursday morning. And while it’s chilly and windy, people are mostly calm and friendly, resigned to make the best of their predicament. As strong, cold gusts pick up throughout the morning, the tent flaps loudly, straining the sandbags holding it down.
Walter Johnson, 76, is one of the first people there, arriving just after 9 am. He came to charge his phone and laptop. A co-worker had warned him about the outages, so he’s stocked with ice and snacks at home. He felt there was nothing to do but wait it out. “I prepared myself mentally,” he says. “I was just waiting for the other shoe to drop.”
Johnson is one of more than a million people who lost power beginning early Wednesday morning, when PG&E started progressively shutting down power to customers in Northern and Central California to avoid potential wildfires brought on by hot, dry, and windy conditions. The utility company set up resource centers in 26 counties in the region to offer the basics, like bathrooms, chargers, water, and WiFi. Around here, visitors, who for the most part live in Oakland, lost power around 10 pm Wednesday night.
The tent isn’t huge—there’s just enough room for about 15 tables and chairs. So it’s a little cramped, but sparse, save for a few posters and folding sidewalk signs displaying rules and a code of conduct. Staff, pulled from PG&E’s customer care division, stay by the tent’s entrance, answering questions and handing out water; one staffer offers a woman, who is in shorts, a sweatshirt to stay warm.
Joanie S., 57, comes in just before 10 am and asks the three workers staffing the center how long the outage is going to last. They can’t give her a firm answer, though they are hopeful that some power will be restored Thursday. They offer her water. “What else can I get?” she asks. “I’m just being honest.” She wants a case of water, but they settle on five bottles, and a woman from PG&E helps her bring them to her car parked outside.
“I’m frustrated. I’m angry,” Joanie, who lives in the Oakland hills, tells me in the parking lot. “What are we learning from this? Because this is crazy.” She doesn’t completely trust PG&E’s stated reasons for shutting off the electricity, hinting it might have something to due with the financial losses it’s incurred due to fires and litigation. The company declared bankruptcy in January after its role in sparking recent wildfires led to lawsuits and major payouts.
“I would like to see more communication about restoring the power,” she says. She received a text message from PG&E warning ahead of time about the shutoff, but hasn’t gotten direct updates since. On Monday, she had gone to Target to stock up in preparation. “The shelves were bare,” she says. She got a battery pack and a crank radio and went to check on her parents who she cares for and who are in their 80s. When the power went out Wednesday night, it was pitch black in her neighborhood. She works at night and she’s concerned about driving safely in the dark tonight. Power outages have led to multiple car accidents in the North Bay at intersections without traffic signals.
Ultimately, though, she’s trying to come to peace with the situation. “I’m looking to tweak some habits,” she says. “You don’t realize how dependent you are on all these devices.”
Martin Vance, 39, is here because his classes at the University of California, Berkeley, were cancelled for the second day in a row. He lives in Oakland’s Diamond District, and his power went out at 11 pm last night. He’s frustrated about a lack of communication, too. First his power was supposed to be turned off at noon on Wednesday, and then 8 pm, and then later. Official reports say the outages could last several hours or even several days for some areas—though he knows nothing more specific than that. “You can’t get a clear sense,” Vance says. “The whole day I was waiting.” He’s in the middle of midterms but spent time driving around with his girlfriend buying flashlights and food and water for a week. If this is the new normal, “they have to figure out a better system ultimately,” he says.
He’s right, these situations could become more and more frequent as climate change progresses. The fire season in California is already longer than before, and officials are scrambling to figure out how to avoid the disastrous fires that have happened in the past few years. Still, a lot of people at the resource center don’t understand why the power is out when wind isn’t high in their neighborhoods. Because PG&E covers such a large territory—it’s the one of the biggest energy companies in the United States—electricity to one area might be coming from a completely different region with worse weather conditions. That’s why more people have been talking about localized power and micro-grids as possible solutions to the problem.
Elisa Sconza, 30, an EMT at the Oakland Zoo, helps another woman order a battery pack she recommends online. Sconza tells me the Oakland Zoo remains closed. Some zookeepers were scrambling to keep everything running. Exhibits that require special support like water filtration systems are being powered by generators, but the animals are doing okay. Sconza has three battery packs with her, including one that doubles as a lantern. All her appliances are electric though, so she has resorted to cold showers, and as for the food in her fridge and freezer, “I said we’re going to have a warm beer and shrimp barbecue.”
Many people aren’t as well prepared. Dorothy Cole, 81, and her daughter Jana Cole, 57, laugh when I ask them about their preparations. “I never thought about anything like this,” Dorothy says. Their garage door is stuck, and they’ve had trouble communicating with choppy cell service and no access to WiFi. “Everything’s so interconnected,” she says. It’s a little stressful because Dorothy’s 10-year-old granddaughter is staying with them for a week. She has allergies, so they have to be careful with what canned food they’re buying. When they lost power, they charged their phones in the car, but then needed to get more gas. They aren’t alone. At gas stations around California, lines have been snaking around parking lots as people wait to refill. “For the first time I’m thinking about getting a generator,” Jana says. With climate change, she’s wondering about solar power and other backup. “I am rethinking how are we going to adjust.”
By noon on Thursday, PG&E restored power to 126,000 customers, but 600,000 were still affected.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The initiative, which was rolled out to great fanfare earlier this year, is being run by US ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. It has become a favorite talking point of younger Trump supporters as they seek to defend a president who has rolled back transgender rights and nominated anti-LGBT judges. Both Trump and his eldest son, Don Jr., have tweeted about it enthusiastically.
There’s just one problem: Activists and other sources deeply involved in the decriminalization movement tell Mother Jones that for all the tweets and publicity, the administration has done virtually nothing that is likely to produce tangible results. While Grenell, who is gay, has convened a handful of panel discussions with activists in Europe, the Trump team appears to have done far less on the issue than the previous administration.
“There’s nothing,” says David Pressman, a partner at the Boies Schiller Flexner law firm who worked on international LGBTQ policy under Obama. Grenell’s events, he says, have “not translated into any meaningful, coordinated, strategic effort.”

Problems with the initiative emerged early on. When NBC first broke news of its launch, Trump appeared not to know it existed. At some point, he did get the message and seemed to recognize the value of publicizing it. To commemorate the start of Pride Month, Trump tweeted about the “global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality.” Two months later, the Log Cabin Republicans, a pro-LGBT group, cited it approvingly in their endorsement of Trump’s reelection campaign. (The group had declined to endorse him in 2016.) Then in September, it appeared in his UN speech.
“President Trump really fancies himself an LGBT ally,” says Ryan Thoreson, a Yale Law School lecturer and researcher with Human Rights Watch. “He thinks that he’s really good for LGBT rights and seems disconnected from the reality that his administration has consistently attacked LGBT people domestically, and hasn’t offered anything more than rhetoric for LGBT people abroad.”
In February, US officials told NBC that Grenell’s initiative would likely “include working with global organizations like the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as other countries whose laws already allow for gay rights.” The State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) was expected to play an organizing role, given its focus on international LGBTQ rights during the Obama administration. But two sources close to that office told Mother Jones that it has been frequently left out of the loop in the months since the campaign was launched. “No one in DRL has any idea what’s going on,” a former State Department official said. “There is no process.”
Even if DRL had attempted to play a prominent role in the effort, it would have had fewer resources and heft to contribute. Last year, the White House tried to gut the bureau’s budget by nearly 25 percent—Congress approved a smaller cut closer to 20 percent—and, like the rest of the State Department, it’s still recovering from the hiring freeze instituted by Trump’s first secretary of State, Rex Tillerson.
In addition to DRL, any coordinated push toward decriminalization would involve designated point people elsewhere within the State Department, officials at other federal agencies, and input from National Security Council staff at the White House. But it’s unclear whether any of that is actually happening. “All we’ve seen is two meetings without a lot of follow-up in Berlin, and one kind of similar meeting in Kiev,” said Mark Bromley, chair of the Council for Global Equality, which advocates for American foreign policy to prop up LGBTQ rights across the globe. “Perhaps they will put more diplomatic and financial muscle behind it, but we certainly haven’t seen an integrated decriminalization program.”
Trump’s State Department has participated in the Equal Rights Coalition, a multilateral body that promotes LGBTQ equality, and has signed the group’s statements objecting to crackdowns on minorities in Brunei and Chechnya. But the administration has been noticeably silent about similar crackdowns by close allies, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kenya.
The State Department declined to comment for this story. The US embassy in Berlin did not respond to a request for comment.
Without a coherent strategy, the US effort has missed crucial opportunities to support activists fighting for decriminalization in their home countries. Njeri Gateru, director of the National Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission in Nairobi, said that American diplomats never reached out in the run-up to the Kenyan High Court’s ruling in May on whether to overturn a colonial-era law against gay sex. “Not to me. Not to anyone who I know,” she said. The law was ultimately upheld.
The approach was far different during the Obama years, when officials kept in close touch with activists like Gateru to ensure statements by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other leaders accurately reflected what was happening on the ground. This preparation preceded the administration’s release of memorandum in 2011 that directed diplomatic personnel to “promote and protect” LGBTQ rights abroad. “The conversation did more to build than to destroy,” Gateru says. “We felt like we were part of the conversation and part of the consultation.” In July 2015, Obama directly criticized the Kenyan government’s oppression of LGBTQ people while standing next to Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta during a joint press conference, equating it to state-sponsored racism in the United States. The Kenyan leader responded by brushing aside gay rights as a “non-issue” in his country.
Pressman, who represented the United States on the UN Security Council under Obama, said that while developing Obama’s memorandum, “we weren’t doing public events and tweeting about it. We were doing the hard work of figuring out how you actually get this thing done.” The process involved buy-in from senior leaders like Clinton, who later inaugurated the policy with a speech in Geneva, where she declared, “Gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.”
That support does not appear to be forthcoming from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who opposes gay marriage and once suggested that gay sex was a “perversion.” Under his leadership, the State Department has declined requests from several embassies to fly rainbow flags during Pride Month and has created a “Commission on Unalienable Rights” to refocus discussion of human rights toward “our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights.” More than two dozen LGBTQ advocacy organizations blasted Pompeo in an open letter for this, writing in June that Pompeo’s natural law formulation “is used by a variety of organizations as code words for denying human and civil rights to LGBTI citizens.” When the commission was announced in July, critics “wondered whether the volunteer panel will undermine [DRL], which for more than four decades has been responsible for holding abusive governments to account,” the Washington Post reported.
While NBC, citing American officials, reported in February that Pompeo “is supporting the work by US embassies and consulates to fight violence and discrimination against LGBT people,” sources with knowledge of the situation have described a more fraught dynamic. “There does seem to be some power play going on between Ric Grenell—and his political connections—and Secretary Pompeo in Washington,” one source who speaks regularly to DRL officials told Mother Jones. The newly-confirmed DRL head, former Catholic University law professor Robert Destro, appears to be aligned with Pompeo here. He has argued that people in same-sex marriages are not protected under sex discrimination laws and has described marriage between a man and woman as “the very institution on which the entire natural, legal and social order depends.”
Pompeo has thrown his weight behind other State Department initiatives, such as an annual religious freedom summit, that more closely align with his evangelical Christian values. At the UN, Trump announced $25 million in funding to promote religious tolerance and the protection of relics and religious sites. He also tapped an ambassador-at-large for religious freedom, Sam Brownback, who as governor of Kansas rescinded protections for LGBTQ workers.
But the administration has been less eager to staff the department with people whose job it is to protect LGBTQ rights. In 2015, Obama appointed the first-ever special envoy charged with promoting the human rights of gender and sexual minorities. Trump initially kept on the Obama-era official, Randy Berry, and Tillerson vowed to preserve the position. But amid backlash from conservative Christian groups, Berry was switched to a different role and was later named ambassador to Nepal. He was not replaced.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z
https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/heres-another-impeachable-offense-trumps-war-on-the-constitution/,2019-10-09,,,politics,"October 8, 2019",Here’s Another Impeachable Offense: Trump’s War on the Constitution,David Corn,MotherJones,Impeachment,"Resolved, the president of the United States ought to be impeached for “interfering or endeavouring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation…and Congressional Committees.” That’s a line from the first article of impeachment against Richard Nixon approved on July 27, 1974 by the House Judiciary Committee on a 27-to-11 bipartisan vote. (You can listen to the roll call for the vote here.) Three days later, the committee approved on a 21-to-17 bipartisan vote the final of its three articles of impeachment, with this one hitting Nixon for refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas for “papers and things…deemed necessary” for the House’s impeachment investigation. And now Donald Trump is providing today’s House Democrats little choice but to consider similar charges as their impeachment inquiry proceeds.
As the New York Times reported on Tuesday morning, “The White House all but declared war on the House impeachment inquiry…intervening for the first time to block the testimony of a key witness as President Trump signaled his administration would try to starve investigators of more witnesses and documents.” That witness was Gordon Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union. He is a Trump crony—a fellow hotel magnate—who raised money for the GOP in 2016 and donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. A novice in the field of diplomacy, Sondland was given the EU ambassadorship presumably due to his pro-Trump largesse. And he has become embroiled in the Trump-Ukraine scandal. Text messages turned over to House investigators include exchanges between Sondland and fellow American diplomats suggesting that Sondland knew Trump was proposing an inappropriate quid pro quo to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky—and wasn’t comfortable with it. The House Democrats running the Ukraine investigation had requested that Sondland come in for a private interview. But shortly after midnight on Tuesday morning, hours before he was supposed to report to Capitol Hill, the State Department ordered Sondland not to talk to the congressional investigators.
Then, late Tuesday afternoon, Trump intensified his assault on House investigators by a factor of gazillion. His White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and several House Democratic chairs a blistering eight-page letter declaring that the Trump White House will not cooperate with the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. “President Trump and his Administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process,” Cipollone proclaimed in the letter, which was full of partisan outrage and devoid of legal arguments. He added that Trump “cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry.” In other words, the White House will turn over nada to the Democrats—it will produce no documents, no witnesses.
This was no shocker. The White House has routinely blocked House Democrats investigating a wide array of alleged Trump wrongdoing from gaining access to witnesses and documents. The White House has thwarted House Judiciary Committee efforts to probe the various alleged instances of Trump obstructing justice outlined in detail in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report by blocking witnesses, including former White House counsel Don McGahn, from being questioned by the committee. Attorney General Bill Barr refused to appear before the panel when told he would be questioned by a committee lawyer in addition to members. On orders from the White House, Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, declined to answer questions about some of his conversations with Trump when he came before for the committee. Other witnesses questioned as part of the House Democrats’ investigation of the Trump-Russia scandal and Trump’s possible obstructions of justice—such as former Trump senior aide Hope Hicks—also have followed White House instructions to keep mum about their interactions with Trump—without the White House formally invoking executive privilege. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has impeded the House Ways and Means Committee’s request for Trump’s tax returns, though the law clearly states that the IRS “shall” turn over such records if the committee asks for them. This has forced House Democrats to go to court. The Justice Department has also said nyet to a House request for investigative material related to Mueller’s probe, triggering another court case.
There are other instances of Trump thumbing his nose at the House’s demands for information and witnesses, and now he is applying that tactic to his impeachment defense. In refusing to make any witnesses and documents available to House Democrats, the White House has been arguing, without any merit, that Congress essentially has no oversight responsibilities that are not part of a legislative process—that is, congressional investigators are prohibited from investigating possible wrongdoing for investigation’s sake. This is an absurd position and one not followed by Republicans when they have been in charge. (Benghazi, anyone?) And though legal experts generally agree that the House’s authority to demand possible evidence of wrongdoing deepens when impeachment is on the table, Trump and his lawyers are now stretching their absurd no-investigations-allowed argument to cover all requests linked to the impeachment inquiry. In his letter, Cipollone is contending that if a president considers an impeachment proceeding to be politically motivated, he does not have to cooperate. There is no such provision in the Constitution.
Trump’s letter and his overall stonewalling is an assault on the Constitution. As any armchair constitutional law expert knows, Congress is a co-equal branch of the government and was empowered by the framers to be a check on presidential power. Trump, Barr, and the president’s legal team have contended that Trump cannot be indicted on federal charges while he is president. Mueller accepted that argument in his final report. But that report clearly said that this does not mean a president can get off scot-free. Mueller noted it was up to Congress to examine the allegations of obstruction he outlined. And he implied (strongly) that the possible punishment for a presidential violation of the law would be impeachment.
That’s in keeping with the Constitution that awards Congress the right to indict the president, bring him to trial, and then boot him out of office, should he engage in serious wrongdoing. And if Congress has that task, it seems that it also has the right to investigate before doing so. And if it has that right, then it has the right to demand information necessary for such an investigation.
Yet Trump declines to recognize this power. In fact, he has insisted that Article II of the Constitution “allows me to do whatever I want.” That’s obviously nonsense. The authors of the Constitution clearly worried that an authoritarian with alliances with foreign interests might one day inhabit the White House and—good for them!—presciently included provisions to be used in such a dire instance. But Trump is waging a war on the Constitution, and all those congressional Republicans who are riding along with him are collaborators. Yes, we are no longer supposed to play this game, but imagine what they would have shouted had President Barack Obama blocked Hillary Clinton from appearing before the Benghazi committee. Imagine if the Clinton White House had refused to hand over documents to the Republicans who controlled Congress and who investigated every -gate they could find.
Today’s Republicans are neutering Congress and weakening its ability to restrain or punish a president who doesn’t play by the rules, who doesn’t respect the law, and who doesn’t give a damn about constitutional checks and balances. By accepting Trump’s defiance of congressional investigations, they are eviscerating their own powers and establishing a dangerous precedent.
And with these moves, Trump is forcing the Democrats to widen their impeachment inquiry. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has wanted to keep the impeachment process narrowly focused on Trump’s alleged misconduct in the Ukrainian caper. Quid pro quo? Then the president must go. But several House committees have long been at work digging into other possible and impeachable wrongdoing: the alleged obstruction, Trump’s violation of the Emoluments Clause (which bans a president from accepting money from foreigners, unless Congress approves), his involvement in the hush-money payments to a porn star, his welcoming of foreign interference in US elections, and more. Some of these acts may eventually be funneled into articles of impeachment in addition to Ukraine-related charges.
On top of all that now could be Trump’s attempts to cover up his various misdeeds. The House Democrats, after being denied Sondland’s testimony, announced they would subpoena Sondland and related documents. But what if the subpoena is defied, as the Trump administration has ignored other subpoenas in the assorted investigations? The House Dems will then take it to court, as they have other cases. And this issue, like the other cases, may end up with the Supreme Court. Then who knows? But in the meantime, House Democrats can look back 45 years to Nixon and Watergate. Nixon’s refusal to cooperate with congressional investigations was considered an impeachable offense. Trump’s stonewalling can be regarded in the same manner. It violates the intent of the Constitution and prevents the House from fully examining and reviewing conduct that might be cause for impeachment. Shady dealings in Ukraine that entail Trump abusing the power of his office certainly warrant consideration for impeachment. But Trump’s undermining of the Constitution and the rule of law might even be more deserving of that document’s ultimate punishment.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The lawyers argued that gender identity and sexual orientation are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the landmark law that outlawed many forms of discrimination. But the Justices were preoccupied with toilets.
“Does [your] argument hold up when you get to specific work requirements?” Chief Justice John Roberts asked David Cole, the ACLU attorney representing a transgender woman named Aimee Stephens who alleges she was fired after telling her boss she intended to start dressing according to the company’s dress code for women. “In other words, if the objection of a transgender man transitioning to woman is that he should be allowed to use, he or she, should be allowed to use the women’s bathroom, now, how do you analyze that?”
This wasn’t the only time transgender people’s use of restrooms came up: by my count, “bathrooms” and “restrooms” were mentioned 32 times during Stephens’ hearing, and 19 times during the other.
“As drastic a change in this country as bathrooms in every place of employment and dress codes in every place of employment that are otherwise gender neutral would be changed,” Justice Neil Gorsuch said. He suggested that such a change was better handled by the legislature.
Bathrooms have long been a focal point for conservative fear mongering about transgender people, especially among lawmakers. As Mother Jones has previously reported, anti-trans bathroom laws are “sold in part on the fear that predatory men could say they’re transgender to gain access to women’s bathrooms.” Some of the justices, both conservative and liberal, took that rhetoric and ran with it, despite the cases being about whether gay and transgender people have the right to express their identities openly at their workplaces.
“You have a transgender person who rightly is identifying as a woman and wants to use the women’s [bathroom], rightly, wrongly, not a moral choice, but this is what they identify with,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. “Their need is genuine. I’m accepting all of that…But there are other women who are made uncomfortable, and not merely uncomfortable, but who would feel intruded upon if someone who still had male characteristics walked into their bathroom. That’s why we have different bathrooms. So the hard question is how do we deal with that?”
Gorsuch took that concern to another level, suggesting that including LGBTQ people in Title VII would trigger “massive social upheaval.”
Cole doesn’t buy it. “First of all, federal courts of appeals have been recognizing that discrimination against transgender people is sex discrimination for 20 years,” Cole responded. “There’s been no upheaval […] There are transgender male lawyers in this courtroom following the male dress code and going to the men’s room and the Court’s dress code and sex-segregated restrooms have not fallen.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

PG&E said they would begin the proactive shutoffs this evening. These will affect much of the Bay Area surrounding San Francisco County including Oakland and San Jose as well as parts of Central California like Santa Cruz County. Over 100,000 students had classes cancelled Wednesday.
Update, Wednesday Oct. 9, 2019, 3:00 pm: Power has been cut for over 500,000 PG&E customers, primarily in the North Bay, with Solano, Sonoma, and Napa Counties hit the hardest. So far, more than 1 million people have been affected, and that number could double.
At noon, the second phase of outages started to hit other parts of Bay Area immediately surrounding San Francisco, affecting more than 200,000 customers. Alameda County expects over 32,000 will lose power starting between noon and 5 pm Pacific Time. PG&E reports show that almost 8,500 customer with special energy needs due to medical conditions will be affected by the outages. While mass transit systems like BART and Caltrain are still running, officials warned traffic lights in San Jose may not function. Many schools throughout the region closed.
Peak high winds are forecast to remain through Thursday at least, and are expected to be the strongest since the North Bay fires in 2017. The company’s website including the outage map has been intermittently inaccessible due to web traffic. The San Francisco Chronicle created an interactive power shut-down map in the meantime. There is still no word as to when power will be restored.
On midnight Wednesday morning, the Pacific Gas and Electric company will shut off power for roughly 800,000 customers in parts of 34 counties throughout California as a preventative strategy in the face of escalating wildfire threats in the state. Less than a month ago, the California energy company agreed to an $11 billion settlement in its most recent case litigating its role in recent wildfires.
Dry, windy weather expected throughout Northern California prompted the outages, which could last up to five days in some places and affect up to 1.8 million people. Extended periods of time without electricity pose a particular danger to vulnerable populations like children, seniors, low-income people, and those with health issues. To mitigate the negative impacts, PG&E announced it will open community resource centers in 26 counties Wednesday morning with bathrooms, water, air conditioning, and charging stations. But concerned customers struggled to access PG&E’s updates because of a flood of traffic to their website.

Forecasts predict winds up to 70 miles per hour this week, in addition to warm temperatures and low humidity, which creates ideal conditions for wildfires. Last year, the Camp Fire devastated Paradise, a rural community north of Sacramento, killing 86 people, destroying 14,000 homes and causing $16.5 billion in losses. Victims and insurance companies sued PG&E for damages and wrongful death after its power lines allegedly sparked fires in 2017 and 2018. In January, the company filed for bankruptcy.
Climate change is a major contributing factor to the larger, longer-lasting fires. California had more fire damage last year than any other state. A recent study found the area burned annually by forest fires between 1972 and 2018 has increased by five-fold in California, much of which can be attributed to global warming.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

For the United States to begin to extinguish the flames, the country will need to completely restructure its social and political systems. That’s where the Green New Deal comes in.
Veteran activist and environmentalist Naomi Klein rejects the idea that climate solutions should be comfortable, or that they should work within existing capitalist structures, or that “infinite growth on a finite planet is an OK thing.” Her new book, On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal, explains how those in power, on every level, have refused to act against impending peril—and how a Green New Deal could reinvigorate our climate while providing options for economic growth.
“When capitalism produces crises, it naturally lends itself to progressive breakthroughs,” Klein told Mother Jones Editor-in-Chief Clara Jeffrey on stage at the First Congregational Church of Oakland late last month. “This is this is the way people logically respond when capitalism produces crises that create massive misery. Let’s have a different system.”
Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930s provides a groundwork for restructuring capitalism in today’s society. As Klein tells Jeffrey, the New Deal did more than revitalize the economy during the Great Depression by breaking up the banks and instituting Social Security and unemployment insurance. It also addressed the ecological crisis of the Dust Bowl by creating the Civilian Conservation Corps, which planted 2.3 billion trees.
“If you look at where FDR put the Civilian Conservation camps,” Klein said, “he seemingly deliberately put them in parts of the country that didn’t vote for him. You know, in rural areas that had voted Republican. And a lot of those areas flipped.”
So, hardcore climate deniers and eco-fascists aside, Klein thinks it’s possible to sell conservatives on a progressive agenda. But the feasibility of a Green New Deal doesn’t mean things are all bright and cheery.
“I’m terrified. I am grieving for so much that we’ve already lost, and it will never be OK that we lost it,” Klein said. “If we can see any path, no matter how narrow, it is where we could build a future that could have more real solidarity in it, much more humanity reconnecting with the natural world and with each other.”
Tune in to this week’s episode of the Mother Jones Podcast to hear Klein’s and Jeffrey’s wide-ranging discussion of the ecological challenges the United States faces today, the way the climate crisis is intertwined with countless other social issues, and, as a bonus, the merits of impeaching our current president.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In their most ambitious electoral push ever, the organization plans to spend $45 million backing 2020 candidates in local, state and national elections. This is $4 million more than nation’s largest anti-abortion group the Susan B. Anthony List pledged to spend in the 2020 cycle back in June and $15 million more than it deployed during the 2016 elections.
“Next November, our very rights and freedoms will be on the ballot,” Kelly Robinson, Executive Director of Planned Parenthood Votes said in a statement announcing the plan. “Who we elect will determine our access to birth control, cancer screenings, sex education, abortion access and more.”
The group plans to target five million voters nationwide with a focus on mobilizing communities they say are most affected by the Trump administration’s policies including “Black and Latinx people, the LGBTQ+ community, youth, and people with low incomes.” Planned Parenthood has also launched a Candidate Spotlight tool, which will give voters information on the reproductive rights records of 2020 presidential candidates on issues such as abortion access, birth control, and sex education.
The timing of this announcement takes place one week after the Supreme Court decided to take-up its first major abortion case, June Medical Services v. Gee, since adding two conservative Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, to the court. The case focuses on a 2014 Louisiana law that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, and is nearly identical to a Texas law, which the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional in 2016. As I reported earlier this month, legal scholars see this case as potentially having a major impact on abortion access:
The fact that this case is on the docket during an election year, with the Supreme Court’s decision likely to come out in the summer of 2020, brings even more attention to abortion rights in the upcoming presidential election. Planned Parenthood has been especially targeted by he Trump administration. In August, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a domestic gag rule on the Title X program—the nation’s only comprehensive reproductive health care program, which was enacted in 1970 by Richard Nixon—and blocked organizations who received Title X funding from offering or referring patients for abortion services. The decision prompted Planned Parenthood, which served roughly 41% of all Title X patients, to leave the program and relinquish over $60 million in funding.
“Planned Parenthood Votes will use every tool at our disposal to hit the pavement, hit the airwaves, and elect reproductive rights champions up and down the ballot,” said  Robinson in a statement. “We know this is a fight we can win.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Will Your State Protect You?,Laura Thompson,MotherJones,Politics,"On May 4, 2016, Mark Horton signed the paperwork to make it official: He would soon be the vice president of sales and marketing at Midwest Geriatric Management. He resigned from his job at a competing health care company and went about collecting documents needed for his onboarding. All was going smoothly until Horton hit a bureaucratic snag getting copies of his college transcripts and diplomas.
Two weeks after he accepted the offer, Horton emailed his new boss, a woman named Faye Bienstock, to update her on those educational records. He promised they were coming, and mentioned that “my partner has been on me about [my MBA] since he completed his PHD a while back.”
Five days later, Bienstock, according to court documents, emailed Horton withdrawing the job offer. She explained in the email that the change was because of the diploma delay. But Horton has another theory about why the offer was rescinded: MGM didn’t want a gay person in the company.
Horton is a resident of Madison County, Illinois, where state law prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. But the MGM office is just across the Mississippi River in St. Louis, Missouri, where no such protections exist.
Horton still sued MGM, arguing that, under federal law, it’s illegal for employers to discriminate against gay employees. A lower court dismissed the case, and it is now pending before the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. If it succeeds, Horton’s suit could overturn the circuit court’s precedent excluding gay people from federal employment protections. Whether it will largely depends on three other, similar cases, currently being considered by the Supreme Court.
All three of the cases, which are being argued in front of the Supreme Court on Tuesday, involve LGBTQ people who say they were fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman from Michigan, was fired from her job at a funeral home in 2013 after she informed her boss that she was transitioning and intended to begin dressing according to the company’s dress code for women. The Sixth Circuit Court ruled in Stephens’ favor, but the funeral home’s appeal brought the suit to the high court. The other two cases involve gay men who, like Horton, were dismissed after coming out at work.
Lawyers from the ACLU and other advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs are arguing that gay and transgender people are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which says employers aren’t allowed to discriminate on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, or religion. Sexuality and gender identity discrimination, the lawyers say, is a form of sex discrimination. Tuesday’s oral arguments mark the first time the Court has considered this question.
If the court agrees that sexual orientation and gender identity fall under Title VII, all workers, both public and private, would be protected from anti-LGBTQ workplace discrimination. A ruling in the opposite direction wouldn’t overturn state employment protection laws, since those by and large don’t mention Title VII explicitly. But it could open the door even more to state-level attacks on LGBTQ people in the workplace.
“The Trump administration has indicated that it plans to really roll back protections, especially for trans people,” said Gabriel Arkles, who is on the ACLU team representing Stephens. “And so if the Supreme Court rules the wrong way here, then it would really green light that.” Arkles also worries that employers will be emboldened to fire queer people. “Even in states where a law says that it’s illegal, employers might be confused and we just might see a lot of people losing their jobs in the immediate aftermath of a bad decision.”
Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have laws barring discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; two others, Michigan and Pennsylvania, don’t specifically enumerate sexual orientation and gender identity under employment non-discrimination laws but have civil rights enforcement agencies that investigate discrimination against LGBTQ employees. Governors in 11 states have issued executive orders to include at least sexual orientation in employment non-discrimination policies for public employees (or, in the case of Kentucky, only employees of the state executive branch). Some of these orders lack teeth: The governor of North Carolina signed an employment non-discrimination executive order in 2017 but, as critics pointed out, the bill did little to counteract the harm created by the state’s 2016 “bathroom bill.” According to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that studies local, state and federal LGBTQ policies across the country, only 48 percent of LGBTQ Americans live in states that have employment non-discrimination laws that explicitly apply to them.

And then there are the local ordinances. More than 300 city and county governments have passed laws that ban LGBTQ discrimination in employment, housing, and more. But experts warn they’re difficult to track and it’s almost impossible to know which ones are actually enforced.
Though the Supreme Court’s ruling, which is not expected until 2020, might not directly affect most state laws, it does make a difference for legal precedent. The Seventh Circuit Court (which covers Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin) is the only circuit that has ruled that federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Four other circuits agree with the inclusion of gender identity, but not sexual orientation. The Tenth Circuit (which covers Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming) has ruled that federal law does not include sexual orientation or gender identity. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of including sexual orientation and gender identity in Title VII, all but two circuits will have precedents overturned.

If the court decides those two categories aren’t protected under Title VII, federal enforcement directives would also be nullified. For example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has issued multiple decisions that interpret Title VII to include sexual orientation and gender identity under the definition of sex. The EEOC already receives more than 1,000 “LGBT-based sex discrimination charges” each year. Still, almost 70 percent of the cases closed last year were dismissed for “no reasonable cause.” Depending on the Supreme Court’s decision, the EEOC may not investigate such claims in the future.
For people like Mark Horton—the Illinois man who lost his job offer—the consequences of the Supreme Court’s decision are a lot less abstract. Just days after his lawyer, Gregory Nevins, argued his case, the high court announced that it was taking up the three landmark LGBTQ employment discrimination cases. The circuit court decided to hold off ruling on his case until the Supreme Court hands down its decisions.
“If his employer had been in Illinois, he would probably already have a resolution to this discrimination claim,” Nevins said. “But because it’s in Missouri, it’s been a few years now and nothing.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Heather Marlowe looked down at her body. Her stomach and thighs were glowing. The nurse took swabs, and reassured her that when police analyzed her rape kit, they would have plenty of DNA to test. Marlowe felt dazed, in a state of shock. “You don’t really process that that was an indication that your life and body were used,” she says. “I just thought, OK, there’s ample saliva, there’s ample semen.”
That was May 2010. A year later, the San Francisco Police Department had yet to analyze the kit; according to court documents, when she pressed them, an officer told her the forensic lab had a “backlog” of more “important crimes.” A year after that, the department said her still-unprocessed rape kit had been put in storage and the case labeled “inactive.” It took until November 2012 for the crime lab to analyze the box of evidence collected by the nurse that night, and though the evidence did not get a hit in the statewide DNA database, the results were never uploaded to the FBI’s national database due to “irregularities.” Marlowe, who believes she was drugged before she was raped by a stranger she met at a city-wide festival, says that today, she has still not received any information about her toxicology or bloodwork. And in the years after her rape, as she continued to pursue her own case and began asking questions about other rape kits languishing in SFPD custody, she learned that she was not alone. In 2014, the department announced results of an audit conducted partially in response to Marlowe’s advocacy, which showed there were hundreds of unprocessed rape kits in its possession.
“There’s no closure, there’s no, ‘Your rape kit has been tested and put in CODIS,’ no nothing,” Marlowe says of her case, nine years on. “I was so desperate that I continued to work with the various city officials and advocates and whatnot who told me, ‘Oh no, just wait a little bit longer. They will get to you.’ I realized in retrospect that I think they were just blowing smoke.”
In 2016, Marlowe filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city, accusing the police department of mishandling sexual assault reports like hers by neglecting to process rape kits, allotting too few resources to sexual violence investigations, and failing to properly train and supervise personnel—all of which, the lawsuit argued, had a “discriminatory impact” on women. Her complaint alleged that the police department’s delay in testing her kit was part of a larger pattern of treating sexual assault with “deliberate indifference.” But her case was dismissed by a federal judge, and an appeal was denied by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On Monday, the Supreme Court denied a petition to reconsider the ruling.
The decision is a blow to the growing number of survivors across the country who have sued local governments for neglecting or mishandling sexual assault reports. For example, last summer, in Austin, Texas, three women filed a class action lawsuit claiming city and county authorities “disbelieved, dismissed, and denigrated” female sexual assault survivors and failed to pursue investigations, in part by not testing DNA evidence. In Maryland last fall, two former University of Maryland-Baltimore County students alleged that the Baltimore police department “covers up reports and refuses to investigate those it cannot cover up.” And in Memphis, Tennessee, a class action battle has been ongoing since 2013, when three women who survived attacks by the same serial rapist filed a complaint focused on the city’s roughly 15,000 untested rape kits. Other cases have been filed in Connecticut, Illinois, and New York.
As awareness about untested rape kits has increased, questions about how to hold police departments accountable for failing sexual assault survivors have lingered. The wave of lawsuits filed in the last few years, mostly in federal court, are an attempt to force police departments to complete the investigative steps they should have been taking all along. They argue that local governments are violating the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by under-policing sexual assault, a crime that disproportionately affects women. In doing so, they apply old ideas about the meaning of “equal protection”—stemming from Reconstruction-era concerns about unpunished white violence against black citizens—to modern-day concerns about how the criminal justice system handles sexual violence, according to Deborah Tuerkheimer, a law professor at Northwestern University. “The rape kit issue is really the most visible, most tangible, most easy-to-get-our-hands-around manifestation of a much deeper, more pervasive, more systemic issue,” Tuerkheimer says.
What we think of as the national “rape kit backlog” actually consists of two sets of kits. The first is in crime labs, which maintain an enormous queue of unprocessed DNA evidence—about 169,000 requests at last count, including an unknown number of rape kits. The second group consists of those the police never submitted for analysis. “These kits never even made it to the labs,” says Marlowe, who argues that “backlog” in this case is a euphemism for police neglect. “They’re being stockpiled and never even attempted to be tested.” Over the last decade, city-by-city investigations and audits have revealed warehouses, closets, and lockers full of such unprocessed kits, some of them literally growing mold, and many of them placed there after detectives decided a sexual assault report was not worth investigating, according to the Government Accountability Office. The true number of these unprocessed kits is unknown, but some sexual assault advocacy organizations, including the Joyful Heart Foundation and RAINN, estimate that it reaches into the hundreds of thousands.
Even with the Supreme Court’s denial on Monday, it’s still too soon to tell how successful the other lawsuits will be in court, Tuerkheimer warns. But it’s clear they face an uphill battle. For one thing, when domestic violence survivors tried to make a similar argument about Equal Protection in the 1970s and 80s, the courts required that they show evidence that police officers were intentionally discriminating against women, a high bar. Marlowe’s lawsuit clears that hurdle: According to her complaint, a San Francisco police officer told her that because she was “a woman” who “weighs less than men” and has “menstruations,” she “should not have been out partying with the rest of the city on the day she was drugged, kidnapped, and forcibly raped.” (John Coté, a spokesperson for the San Francisco city attorney’s office, maintains that city employees were “always respectful of her concerns and tried to help.”) But not all cases are as clear cut.
Then there’s a second problem. The Equal Protection clause requires that the government not deny people protection under its laws, but Marlowe’s case begs the question: protection equal to whom? It’s unclear which cases to compare Marlowe’s to. “Are women being discriminated against compared to domestic violence victims who are men?” Tuerkheimer asks. “Or should you be comparing domestic violence to other kinds of crimes?” This problem is part of the reason a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California rejected Marlowe’s lawsuit in 2017, writing that she did not “allege any facts to support a finding that persons who reported other types of crimes were treated more favorably.” Marlowe’s lawyer, Becky James, admits that “there really isn’t a comparable group. There are no other crimes where you have a rape kit. It kind of sets up an impossible burden.”
Then there are the technical difficulties, such as statutes of limitations, which limit the amount of time survivors have to bring legal claims. Marlowe didn’t find out that San Francisco had a stockpile of untested rape kits until 2014, and she sued the city for discrimination within the two-year window provided in this type of lawsuit. But the district court ruled that the statute of limitations clock had actually started running in 2012, around the time her rape kit was finally tested, and that Marlow had filed her legal claim too late. She isn’t the only one stuck in this catch-22: A case in Houston has run into similar problems.
Despite these difficulties, at least one of the rape kit lawsuits has been settled. According to the New York Times, last fall, the Village of Robbins, Illinois, paid an unknown settlement to the plaintiff of an equal protection lawsuit that claimed village police had a “decades-long policy of not investigating rapes against women and girls.”
But if most of the Equal Protection suits end up failing in the courts, there are other ways to hold the cops accountable. In another Chicago suburb, county authorities stepped in and took over local sexual assault investigations after discovering untested rape kits in a 2007 raid of the police department. The federal government has a role to play, too. A Department of Justice investigation into police, prosecutors, and public university officials in Missoula, Montana, found evidence that all three were violating the Equal Protection Clause by failing to respond adequately to sexual assault, and they signed legal agreements to change their practices. But since President Donald Trump took office, the Justice Department has not continued to exert the same kind of pressure on local agencies to do better.
In the meantime, Marlowe is continuing her activism. In 2015, she and one of the survivors suing Memphis formed a nonprofit, People for the Enforcement of Rape Laws, to focus on pressuring police to change how they respond to sexual violence. Meanwhile, her case continues to reverberate in local San Francisco politics: Suzy Loftus, the former president of the San Francisco Police Commission who is currently running for San Francisco district attorney, was accused in Marlowe’s lawsuit of “creating and perpetuating” a policy in the police department of not “promptly and equitably” investigating rape cases. (On Friday, in a controversial move, San Francisco mayor London Breed appointed Loftus interim DA ahead of the election.) In a statement, Loftus campaign spokesperson Debbie Mesloh said that “after listening to the voices of sexual assault survivors,” Loftus helped clear San Francisco’s rape kit backlog and hold the police department accountable for future delays in testing. Marlowe’s lawsuit, she said, was “meritless.” If elected, Loftus has vowed to review previously declined sexual assault cases for potential prosecution, improve police training, and increase services for survivors.
Marlowe doesn’t trust her promises. “It’s all talk about survivors, survivors’ voices and survivors’ stories, victims’ rights,” she says, “until somebody sues.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

As its hook, her story revolves around the fate of the local library.
Let me set the scene. Clinton is the seat of Van Buren County, which has a population of 16,000. Van Buren’s average income is way below the national average and its poverty rate is way above. The average private-sector wage is about $12. They are still suffering from the loss of revenue they used to get from shale gas operators, which has slashed the county budget by 20 percent. Back when times were better, the county built a new library in Clinton, but they still owe $2.1 million on it and they aren’t sure where that money will come from. The library made budget cuts, but there was still a real chance that they might have to close up entirely.
In the midst of all this, the library board proposed increasing the pay of the head librarian by about a third. After all, the candidate for the job had a master’s degree. The residents of Clinton were unimpressed and declined to approve the raise:
This is the overall tone of the piece: residents of Clinton dislike government spending even when it benefits them, and they really dislike it when it benefits others—especially nonwhite others. But if they aren’t willing to pay higher taxes and spend more on things like libraries, they’ll never attract smart people and they’ll never prosper. They just don’t know what’s good for them.
I’m sort of hesitant to ask this, but am I the only liberal who read this piece and was badly put off by the condescension that ran through nearly every paragraph? Putting aside for a moment the larger problems of rural America, we have here a poor county that has lost a big chunk of revenue over the past few years, and in the middle of that the library board wants to raise the salary of the head librarian by a huge amount.
Can we talk? Does a small rural library really need a librarian with a master’s degree? Should a small rural library really try to pay a salary competitive with a large town or small city? Should anyone be even slightly surprised that the good folks of rural Clinton were not thrilled with the idea of giving their librarian a big raise in the middle of a budget crunch—especially at the same time that they’re already being asked to approve tax hikes to pay off the library building itself? Is it possible that this was a perfectly normal reaction, not a veiled expression of hatred toward immigrants and the poor?
Lord knows, I’m familiar with all the counterarguments. Rural areas are already subsidized by us big-city elites, taking in more in federal benefits than they pay in federal taxes—and showing damn little gratitude for it. Rural areas tend to be insular and, yes, often fairly racist. Rural areas are never going to be actually liberal, so who cares about them? Rural areas are overrepresented in our national discourse and in our national politics.
But even if all that is true, is it really surprising that a rural county with an average wage of $12 thinks that a big-city librarian is not the best use of their money? Does this really teach us a lesson about how they lack a sense of community? Or is it just common sense that maybe some of us big-city types don’t quite get?",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The Kurdish forces are considered terrorists by Turkey, and the directive all but hands the region over to Turkey and its increasingly authoritarian leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In return for the US allowing the offensive to go forward, Turkey will assume responsibility for detained ISIS fighters who have remained in the region.
Trump’s desire to reduce US involvement in Syria has repeatedly rattled his advisers at the Pentagon and in the intelligence community, who have long recommended that he keep a residual troop presence to ward off a resurgent ISIS. Former Trump Defense Secretary James Mattis and Brett McGurk, envoy to the counter-ISIS campaign, both resigned over Trump’s surprise decision to announce the withdrawal of roughly 2,000 troops from Syria in December, which Trump agreed to after a phone call with Erdoğan. Before making the abrupt decision to reverse support for the Kurds over the weekend, Trump spoke again with Erdoğan, providing another example of the US president trusting foreign despots over his own advisers.
“Donald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief,” McGurk wrote on Twitter early Monday. “He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm’s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call.”
Thanks to this latest phone call, the Kurds “could be- and many expect will be- wiped out in a campaign of ethnic violence/displacement,” Richard Engel, chief foreign correspondent for NBC News, wrote Monday morning. Even if that prediction ends up looking hyperbolic, the Pentagon’s ability to recruit trustworthy allies has already taken a hit.
A spokesperson for the Syrian Defense Forces, the Kurdish-led group allied with US troops in Syria, tweeted that “people here are owed an explanation regarding,” among other things, the “failure of US to fulfill their commitments.” Other Syrian Kurds, speaking anonymously to Engel, had much harsher words for Trump. “The Americans are traitors,” one Kurdish official told NBC. “They have abandoned us to a Turkish massacre. We can no longer fight against isis and have to defend ourselves. This could allow isis to return to the region.”

In a series of tweets on Monday, Trump defended his decision as a way to pull out of “these ridiculous Endless Wars” and prevent American prisons from having to take responsibility for securing thousands of ISIS fighters. “The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,” Trump said. At a United Nations press conference last year, he described the group in far different terms to a Kurdish journalist (who Trump dubbed “Mr. Kurd”). “Kurds are great people, great fighters, I like them a lot,” Trump said. “They fought with us, they died with us.”
The Kurdish people have long occupied a sort of pariah status in the Middle East, where they have labored since World War I to form their own independent state and have frequently clashed with the governments of Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. Their willingness to fight alongside American-backed troops made them useful allies in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the counter-ISIS campaign in Syria. But having ignored Iraqi Kurds’ calls for independence in 2017, the United States now appears to be abandoning its frequent allies again, this time in Syria.
Last year, Turkish soldiers invaded Afrin, a majority-Kurdish city in northern Syria, as a bulwark against the growing influence of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which along with other Kurdish groups, has “increasingly agitated against” Erdoğan’s government, “conducting numerous attacks against Turkish authorities,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. (Kurds compose roughly one-fifth of Turkey’s population.)
Erdoğan, who overcame a failed coup attempt in 2016 and a brutal political setback for his party in June, has become less restrained in cracking down on dissent within his own country and outside its borders. As part of his strategy to shore up his grip on power, Erdoğan has also cultivated close ties with Trump, who has been “consistently cozy” in phone conversations with him and other authoritarian rulers, like Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Washington Post reported.
Trump has often made rash commitments to foreign counterparts on these calls without looping in his national security team. In December, he announced the surprise withdrawal of US troops from Syria at Erdoğan’s urging and “over [the] strong objections from virtually everyone involved in the fight against the Islamic State group,” the Associated Press reported. This more recent decision to abandon the Kurds followed a nearly identical sequence of events. The New York Times noted that Trump spoke to Erdoğan on Sunday and agreed to a decision that went “against the recommendations of top officials in the Pentagon and the State Department.” A senior administration official, speaking to reporters Monday on the condition of anonymity, insisted that Trump did not blindside his advisers, as some media outlets reported, and actually “did not endorse and do[es] not endorse any Turkish military operation in Northern Syria.” Defense Secretary Mark Esper deleted a tweet hours earlier that said, “DOD does not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria.”
Dana Shell Smith, the former US ambassador to Qatar, said Monday that “there were no good choices” for the United States in northern Syria, given the clash between Turkey—a NATO ally—and the Kurds, an expedient ally against ISIS. But Trump’s chaotic style of policymaking has only made things worse. “I don’t blame Trump for the fundamental contradiction in the policy adopted before his time,” she wrote on Twitter. “I do blame him for abandoning all foreign policy deliberation and process so that choices are consistently bad.” Perhaps fittingly, the decision came days after reports emerged that Trump plans to significantly reduce the size of the White House National Security Council, which advises the president on foreign policy matters. Even Turkey was apparently surprised by Trump’s quick shift.
Foreign policy has often been the only realm where Senate Republicans have bucked Trump, and Monday’s news proved to be no different. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said the Trump administration had made “a grave mistake” that could spiral into a “more dangerous regional war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) pledged to introduce a sanctions package with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) if Turkey invades Syria and said in a series of tweets that “this decision makes it difficult for the U.S. to recruit allis against radical Islam.” Even Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a statement questioning the wisdom of Trump’s decision. Less hawkish figures on the right welcomed Trump’s decision. Dan Caldwell, senior adviser to conservative advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America, said in a statement that his group applauds “President Trump for this action and urge[s] him to follow through on his promise to completely withdraw American forces from Syria.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But wait. Even the LAT analysis might be too optimistic. A study from the California Policy Lab at UCLA comes up with even higher numbers for the US homeless population:
These numbers, it turns out, aren’t really disputed. So why does it matter? Partly because the right policy response depends on a realistic assessment of the problem. If most of the homeless are just down on their luck and need a temporary place to stay, that calls for a particular kind of housing response. But if the vast majority are mentally ill or struggling with addiction, that calls for an entirely different response.
But that’s not all. I’ve made this point before and gotten raked over the coals for it, but if you want to solve the homeless problem you have to understand the public resistance to building local homeless shelters. Is it because most of us are self-centered assholes who refuse to help the poor if it means even the slightest inconvenience to our otherwise comfortable lives? If that’s the case, the right response might be education or guilt or just plain political bulldozing.
If the Times analysis and the UCLA report are correct, however, maybe local resistance is actually based on understandable concerns, not just free floating racism and assholery. Maybe families with children have good reason to be anxious about having addicts and the mentally ill wandering around their neighborhood. Maybe you would be too.
Social problems are hard to solve already, and they’re even harder to solve if we tell ourselves fairy tales and then insist that anyone who sees things differently is a horrible human being. That gets us nowhere, especially if it turns out that these folks have a more realistic view of the problem than we do and are therefore going to become even more stubborn if we try to tell them they’re wrong about things they can see with their own two eyes.

Some Liberals Say That’s a Big Mistake.,Kara Voght,MotherJones,Politics,"In her second press conference after announcing impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a warning: Keep the scope narrow. Objections to the president’s policies on issues like guns, climate change, and immigration “have no place in this discussion,” she said. “Save that for the election. This is about the facts relating to the Constitution.”
That warning has been Pelosi’s constant refrain ever since a whistleblower complaint revealed Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukrainian leaders to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The scandal helped unify the once-divided Democratic caucus, with all but a dozen House Dems quickly embracing the impeachment inquiry. “To uphold and defend our Constitution, Congress must determine whether the president was indeed willing to use his power and withhold security assistance funds to persuade a foreign country to assist him in an upcoming election,” wrote seven Democrats who represent swing districts, six of whom had previously been reluctant to take steps toward impeachment.
In the days that followed, Pelosi made clear that the inquiry should indeed focus narrowly on those particular allegations—allegations that be easily explained to the public. She’s directed the House committees overseeing the process to solely investigate matters under their jurisdiction that relate to Ukraine. The Sunday after her announcement, she huddled with House Democratic leadership to map out a messaging strategy that emphasized making a case around the president abusing his office when he pressured Zelensky to look into the Bidens—and nothing else.
Narrowness, however, isn’t exactly what the Democrats’ progressive base has in mind. Liberal activists, after all, have been pushing for impeachment since long before the Ukraine scandal burst into public view. After the release of the Mueller Report earlier this year, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee announced an impeachment inquiry related to Trump’s Russia scandal. At the time, Pelosi and most Democrats had yet to publicly back the inquiry, but many progressives were already calling for it to be expanded. In a July 30 letter sent to Judiciary leadership, 13 national progressive groups—including Democracy for America and Indivisible—encouraged the committee to broaden its probe to include a host of other actions they viewed as impeachable offenses. These included Trump pressuring the Justice Department and FBI to investigate his political adversaries, such as Hillary Clinton and James Comey; welcoming foreign assistance during the 2016 election; separating children from their families at the border; using the presidency to enrich himself; and abusing his office to promote racial hostility.
Moderate Democrats, meanwhile, countered that their party’s liberal faction has been too partisan, too vocal, and too disorganized in its approach to oversight. They argued that the slow drip of Trump corruption revelations hadn’t created a credible case that Democrats should put aside the kitchen-table issues they ran on in 2018 and instead focus on impeachment.
On September 10, with the Ukraine scandal still widely unknown, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which includes 95 of the House’s most liberal members, formally endorsed the Judiciary Committee’s ongoing impeachment investigation. A week later, Trump’s acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, refused to give Congress the Ukraine whistleblower complaint, turning the nascent controversy into a full-blown constitutional crisis. And one week after that, Pelosi threw her support behind an impeachment inquiry.
After the whistleblower’s allegations unified House Democrats around an impeachment inquiry, progressive lawmakers seemed to get in line with Pelosi’s call for a narrow focus on Ukraine. “The issue with Ukraine is the one that gets us to 218 [Democrats], right?” Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a longtime impeachment supporter, told me right before Congress broke for October recess. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)—a CPC co-chair and Judiciary Committee member who has long called for impeachment—told me Democrats would have to be “very strategic and careful” to not “put out a wide list of things” that might diminish the investigation’s credibility with voters.
“I was pretty skeptical that Pelosi was going to lead on this,” Ezra Levin—whose group, Indivisible, has long been on the bleeding edge of the impeachment push, told me at that time. “But she’s done just about everything we would have hoped for.”
Some progressive activists, however, aren’t giving up on a broader impeachment inquiry. They’d like to see the House vote swiftly on articles of impeachment—sometime before Thanksgiving—and they want those articles of impeachment to reflect all of the president’s alleged crimes, including what came before Ukraine.
“The movement is at a critical stage,” said Anthony Torres, the political director of grassroots group By the People. “If we don’t impeach him on all of his high crimes, what we do is we set a precedent for whoever comes next in the presidency to continue those same abuses of power.”
Last week, the Progressive Change Institute, which has worked close with By the People on impeachment efforts, conducted a survey that concluded that other polling had undercounted support for impeachment. Among the 49 percent of respondents who said they supported an impeachment inquiry, 71 percent of them said that Congress should vote on articles of impeachment that include “all alleged high crimes and misdemeanors, not just the most recent high-profile one.”
Meagan Hatcher-Mays, Indivisible’s director of democracy policy, said she’s hopeful that the articles of impeachment under consideration will include foreign interference, obstruction of Congress, obstruction of justice, and violations of the emoluments clause, which bars the president from using his office for personal enrichment. “We’d be satisfied with the greatest hits,” she says.
In the end, the course of the investigation might help moderates and progressives meet in the middle. Politico counted at least six executive agencies and offices that have now been caught up in the growing scandal. Trump, meanwhile, continues to invite his own scope creep: Last week, the president told reporters on the White House lawn that China should investigate the Biden family, as well. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats’ campaign arm, has seized onto those developments. On Monday, it put out two statements calling attention to Trump’s comments about China. A strategist who works closely with House Democrats said that while the plan remains primarily focused on Ukraine, it will be broadened as necessary as the president continues using his office to coerce foreign governments.
Legal considerations may also encourage Democratic leaders to expand their investigation, since a formal impeachment proceeding is widely believed to give lawmakers greater power to demand documents and testimony that the administration has sought to withhold. On Tuesday, during a federal court hearing on Democrats’ lawsuit to obtain the grand jury materials from Mueller’s Russia investigation, House counsel Doug Letter argued that the impeachment inquiry is not, in fact, strictly limited to Ukraine. He explained that six House committees will share the results of various investigations—which could include allegations related to the Mueller report, or even the president’s taxes—and that the Judiciary Committee will report recommended articles of impeachment to the full House. As for the emphasis on Ukraine, Letter said, “right now the media is focused on that.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

He was there to escort a group of vulnerable migrants as they petitioned for asylum at the port of entry, something that has become increasingly more difficult in recent months.
The Migrant Protection Protocols policy, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” forces migrants who ask for asylum at the border back to Mexico—often for months—to wait on their day in immigration court. The policy started out in the San Diego area at the beginning of the year and has since expanded along the border to South Texas, forcing tens of thousands of migrants to wait in dangerous Mexican border towns—including Matamoros, which sits across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas, and has been given a level 4 “do not travel” warning by the US State Department.
In a tweet sent Monday morning, Castro didn’t mince words about Trump: “Make no mistake: his agenda is killing people—and it’s on purpose.”

It was the first time Castro visited one of these camps in Mexico, and he urged others to do the same “because it truly drives home how much we’re failing these people and unnecessarily harming their lives.”
I spoke to the former secretary of housing and urban development on the phone as he was driving back to San Antonio. Our conversation has been edited for content and clarity.
Why did you travel to Matamoros?
I went to Matamoros today to spotlight the suffering of people there who are living in squalor, drinking dirty water, not eating enough food, and being subjected to crime, all because of this administration’s backwards policy to keep them out of the US while they seek asylum. Today I took 12 people [to the port of entry]—eight of them were from the LBTQ community, and one family with a person who is disabled—to appeal their placement in the [Migrant Protection Protocols] program. I did this because under the terms of the MPP program, people who have a mental health or physical disability are not supposed to be forced to remain in Mexico. Members of the LGBTQ community who have been persecuted, who have been threatened and suffered beatings, often have PTSD, and that should qualify as a mental health issue. The person who is deaf obviously shouldn’t have been placed in the MPP program in the first place.
What did you say when you walked up to the port of entry?
I presented myself to the border agents there, asked for a supervisor, and said we were presenting these people who should not have been in the Remain in Mexico program to begin with. At that point they were taken in, and they were given an opportunity to make their case. Most of the LGBTQ migrants were from Cuba, and the rest from Central America.
Did you get any pushback from the agents at the port of entry?
No, they were professionals.
What was the most upsetting thing you saw today?
The saddest thing that I saw today was a mother with her young child on her lap and the child looked thin, probably from lack of eating much. He seemed weak and very fatigued, probably because of the heat, or perhaps because they don’t have clean drinking water. There are many children who are sick, who are not getting any kind of education, and who are desperate.
You’ve been speaking against the MPP/Remain in Mexico policy for most of the year, and you and I spoke about this back in May, but was there anything that surprised you today seeing it firsthand—especially having crossed into Matamoros?
The scale of the squalor. They’re up to more than 1,000 people there in tents right on the other side of the border. Plus, Matamoros is the newest site; you have more than 3,000 people in Nuevo Laredo and many more in Tijuana. The scale of the desperation is growing quickly as the policy expands. This is a humanitarian disaster that should be ended immediately.
Are you concerned with what the asylum-seeking process in the United States has turned into under this administration?
Absolutely! It’s become a sham! First of all, we don’t have an immigration court system that is properly equipped to deal with the asylum claims, and it should be independent from the Department of Justice. We also should recognize people who are victims of domestic violence and gang violence in asylum claims. We should stop playing games with people at the border.
What was the outcome for the 12 people you took to the port of entry?
We’re waiting to get the news, they are going to go through an interview their appeal of getting put through the MPP process, and we should find out at some point today what happened to them. We’re going to follow up with the Texas Civil Rights Project; they have attorneys who are in contact with each of them.
Now, this was just a handful of people on one day, at one port of entry. We know that tens of thousands are being forced to wait in dangerous Mexican border towns for many months. Knowing the scale of this, what are you feeling right now as you drive away from the border?
This is a betrayal of our values and who we should be as a country, because desperate people are knocking on our door, and instead of allowing them safety as their asylum claim is determined, we push them to unsafe places along the border and have made their lives much worse. Like a lot of people, I’m frustrated by this administration’s cruelty, and I feel more determined than ever to end this policy. There’s also, of course, a sadness, especially for the children who are going through all of this.
You’ve said that if elected president, you would quickly sign an executive order to end this policy. What else needs to happen, both short-term and long-term, to properly address asylum claims at the border?
We need an independent immigration judiciary with enough judges and support staff to hear all of these claims in a timely manner.  We also need to put more resources into getting people connected with family members who are already in the United States so they can find a loving home instead of placing them in the detention facilities. It would be more cost-effective than building more detention facilities. In addition to that, Mexico has a role, as well, in doing what it can to ensure that people have basic living conditions and that they’re safe.
Is there an image from your trip this morning that you’d like people to know about?
Yeah, we went and laid flowers along the banks of the [Rio Grande] river where there were crosses to commemorate the death of a number of migrants, including Oscar and his daughter Valeria. And in that same river just feet away from those crosses little children were playing and bathing themselves. The river is heavily polluted, and that’s the water that people are bathing in.

Note: About two hours after I spoke with Castro, he learned that the 12 asylum-seekers he helped that morning had been sent back to Mexico. They presented their cases for why they feared returning to Mexico, and why they should be exempt from the Migrant Protection Protocols, but US Customs and Border Protection officials denied their claims.

https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/old-age-limit-presidency-bernie-sanders-health-warren-trump-biden/,2019-10-08,,,politics,"October 8, 2019",It’s No Coincidence That the Top Presidential Candidates Are All So Old,Kiera Butler,MotherJones,Politics,"Over the past few months Bernie Sanders has often remarked that he’s in great shape. “I am blessed to have been in good health my entire life,” he told the Washington Post earlier this year. “I honestly can’t remember the last time I missed work because of illness.” I bought it: The guy seemed reasonably fit and sharp. Then, last week, he suffered a heart attack.
Given his age, it’s not all that surprising—about a fifth of men in their 60s and 70s have heart disease; by age 80, nearly a third do. On Inauguration Day, he will be 79, which makes him 40 years older than the oldest of millennials, his most devoted demo. That also makes him the oldest serious contender, but many of his opponents aren’t spring chickens, either: Joe Biden will be 78, Donald Trump 74, and Elizabeth Warren 71.
This grayest-ever crop of frontrunner candidates has made some people wonder whether there should be a legal age limit on running for president. Indeed, other fields turn aging employees out to pasture—commercial airline pilots, employees of the United Nations, and judges in many states aren’t allowed to practice into their 70s. So isn’t it conceivable that the presidency of the United States—by many measures literally the hardest job in the world—shouldn’t go to someone prone to senior moments? And if we have a lower age limit, why not an upper one?
Consider that Jimmy Carter, the oldest living president at 95, said recently, “If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties that I experienced when I was president.”
I recently called up some other accomplished older people to see what they thought about an aging president. Their responses were not exactly encouraging.
A 96-year-old museum docent barked, “I have absolutely no interest in talking to you about that,” and hung up.
The oldest mayor in the United States—who is 80 and runs the city of Stafford, Texas—told me in an email that he would be “happy to visit by phone” but then never got around to calling me back.
An 87-year-old retired CEO said, “Hold on, let me get out of my wheelchair. No, I’m just kidding. Are you young and pretty? Will you go out with me? No, I’m just kidding.”
After that initial round of interviews, you can guess I wasn’t exactly bullish about the idea of a president pushing 80. So I decided to check in with the experts: scientists who study how the aging process affects our bodies and minds. They painted a very different picture.
Nir Barzilai, an endocrinologist with Albert Einstein College of Medicine, studies the genes of a group of long-lived Ashkenazi Jews. Barzilai—who is prone to comments like “Age means nothing to me!” and “I know someone who just went to Machu Picchu for her 100th birthday!”—has been able to show that about 60 percent of the 100-year-old women he’s studied have certain unusual mutations in their growth genes. “We have discovered longevity genes,” he said. Unfortunately, he then added, “Do the candidates have them? I have no idea.”
Short of sharing a full genetic sequencing, Barzilai says that family history is a pretty good predictive factor. That bodes well for Trump, Warren, and Biden, whose parents all lived well into their 80s. But then what to make of Sanders, who has already outlived both of his parents by several decades (and is expected to make a full recovery from his heart attack)? Barzilai acknowledges it’s not just about genes; social and environmental circumstances also help determine how long and how well a person lives.
I found out that more powerful predictors of both longevity and cognitive stability—more powerful than even genetics—are three external factors: education, race, and wealth. Countless studies have found a correlation between income level and lifespan; a 2016 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, found that on average, the richest 1 percent of American men live 14.6 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women the difference is 10.1 years. That’s not surprising: Being wealthy means you have access to good health care and good control over your diet and exercise.
Relatedly, education level matters, too—and even more so along racial lines. In 2012, University of Illinois at Chicago gerontologist and public health researcher Stuart Jay Olshansky sorted deaths in the United States by age, race, and number of years of schooling. He found that on average, black men who hadn’t finished high school lived 14.2 years less than white men who had completed 16 or more years of education; for women that figure was 10.3 years. (It’s important to note that these racial differences probably have to do with lack of opportunity for African Americans, not any biological difference.)
Education also seems to have a strong protective effect against dementia: A 2018 University of Southern California study found that most people who have graduated from college can expect to prevent cognitive decline into their 80s, while people with a high school education often begin to experience it in their 70s. It’s not that education actually prevents the changes in the brain associated with dementia, explained Joe Verghese, another Albert Einstein gerontologist. Rather, education seems to help people compensate for those changes. “The theory is that people who are highly educated and intellectually engaged will be able to stave off the effects of this disease,” he said.
When you consider these external factors, good genes don’t seem as important. All of the presidential candidates are wealthy; all are exceptionally well educated. Take Sanders: It’s valid to speculate that perhaps one reason he has lived so much longer than his parents is that he has a college degree and robust finances, while his parents were poor immigrants who worked all their lives.
University of Illinois’ Olshansky used actuarial tables to calculate the lifespan and “healthspan” of each candidate—basically, the risk that they’ll die or become cognitively or physically disabled while in office. Taking into account wealth and education level he found that all the contenders stand at least a 76.8 percent chance of surviving their first term, most of them higher. (For most, the odds of living through a second term are also high, though for Sanders and Biden, they drop to 66 percent and 70 percent respectively.)
So it’s likely that by dint of privilege and circumstance, even the oldest contenders stand a pretty good chance of surviving the presidency. Fair enough. But that still left me wondering about their mental health and general with-it-ness. Would they, too, last?
The geriatric psychologists I talked to all assured me that contrary to popular belief, elderly people are no more prone to depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders than their younger counterparts. Ellen Langer, a Harvard University psychologist who specializes in geriatric patients, railed against the stereotype of the socially weird old person. It’s not that their age-addled brains make them behave strangely; rather they’ve mastered the fine art of not caring. “At 30 you might be mortified that you have spaghetti sauce on your shirt and you have to go a meeting,” says Langer. “At 70, you might say, ‘Please excuse this, as you can see I was excited about the spaghetti I was eating!’”
In short, Langer says, life experience leads to perspective. And if you have those qualities, so what if you still think people listen to records? What are millennial staffers for, if not to show the president how to, say, use an iPad for briefing updates? (Speaking of millennials, maybe it’s time we rethink the requirement that a president must be at least 35, which hasn’t changed since Continental Congress delegate Tench Coxe wrote that the president “cannot be an idiot, probably not a knave or a tyrant, for those whom nature makes so, discover it before the age of thirty-five, until which period he cannot be elected.” Today, you could probably figure all that out from a 25-year-old candidate’s Twitter feed. And we know people can act tyrannical across ages.)
In any case, the gerontologists told me that age wouldn’t play a major role in their decision on Election Day. And their research suggests that setting a legal age limit for president probably doesn’t make sense—though that may end up being irrelevant: The way things are looking now, Americans won’t have much of a choice but to vote for someone who was born before there were zip codes or magic markers or antihistamines. That’s too bad, since there are signs that Americans are clamoring for younger, more diverse political leadership—see, for example, the upwelling of enthusiasm for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her squadmates. And last year, when I was talking to voters about the 44-year-old African American Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, I heard over and over from people who were thrilled to see a candidate that finally looked like them.
In this country, the same set of extreme social privileges that propel someone to the position of frontrunner presidential candidate also protect against the typical ravages of old age. And that single fact, for better or worse, is a stronger predictor of candidates’ health than any senior-moment gaffe they might have over the coming months. “It’s entirely possible,” Olshansky told me, “that some of these folks running for president are super-agers.” We should all be so lucky.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

6:10 p.m. ET: In an eight-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Adam Schiff, Rep. Elijah Cummings, and Rep. Eliot Engel, White House general counsel Pat Cipollone set a domestic record for political chutzpah, accusing the Democrats of moving forward with an impeachment inquiry “in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process.” It is a remarkable, spluttering document, and nothing short of a declaration of war on the House impeachment inquiry, the separation of powers doctrine, the Constitution, democracy, and contemporary English-language prose.
In the letter, Cipollone, writing on behalf of President Donald Trump, insists that the president be allowed to cross-examine witnesses during the House’s investigation, as if that were a perfectly normal thing to demand. (It isn’t. That’s what the full trial in the Senate is for.) And be sure to stick around for his description of the “completely appropriate” Ukraine call.
Cipollone also whines that Democrats are simply trying to “overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen.” Read the whole thing below.
5:32 p.m. ET: The White House said that it would not participate in House Democrats’ impeachment probe, the Washington Post reports, intensifying tensions between the president and those conducting the impeachment inquiry.


4:45 p.m. ET: The New York Times reports that a White House official who listened to the July phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine called it “crazy,” “frightening,” and “completely lacking in substance related to national security.” The CIA whistleblower wrote in a memo the day after the phone call that the White House official was “visibly shaken by what had transpired,” the Times reports.
3:25 p.m. ET: As Trump continues digging holes for himself, Democrats are debating just how broad the scope of the impeachment inquiry should be. Should it stay focussed strictly on Ukraine, as Nancy Pelosi has argued? Should it include potential obstruction of justice allegations outlined in the Mueller report? How about Trump’s use of the presidency to enrich himself or his abusive family separation policy? Kara Voght reports:
But even as Democratic leaders try to keep their public messaging focused on Ukraine, their legal team is making a different argument in court:
1:00 p.m. ET: Last week, the former special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, provided Congress with a trove of text exchanges related to Ukraine. One of the more damning exchanges involved Sondland and Bill Taylor, a top diplomat to Ukraine, during which Taylor called it “crazy” to tie Ukrainian assistance to help Trump’s reelection campaign. Denying the proposal of a quid pro quo, Sondland then suggested that the conversation stop happening over text. So, what happened between Taylor’s “crazy” remark and Sondland’s sudden concerns with the medium of their conversation? A phone call with the boss, NBC reports:

11:45 a.m. ET:

10:40 a.m. ET: Rudy Giuliani’s television meltdowns have earned him an invitation to speak before the Senate Judiciary Committee, compliments of Sen. Lindsey Graham. Get ready for more conspiracy theories and spitting.
10:10 a.m. ET: Trump, after blocking testimony from a witness who used a personal device to carry out incriminating text conversations, plays the hits.

9:50 a.m. ET: Here’s a bit more background on Sondland from Mother Jones’ Russ Choma. Sondland’s main qualification for serving as Trump’s ambassador to the EU seems to be his career as a hotel magnate and GOP megadonor who contributed $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee:
9:35 a.m. EST: House Intelligence chairman Rep. Adam Schiff slams Sondland’s failure to appear before lawmakers. Schiff says that Sondland has relevant text messages on a personal device that the State Department is withholding. Other Democrats, including 2020 presidential candidates, are also weighing in:



9:25 a.m. ET: Trump makes it clear that the decision to block Sondland’s testimony came directly from the top.

His explanation, centering on Turkey’s financial support for an American fighter jet, was missing a few key facts though.

The F-35, a stealth jet produced primarily by Lockheed Martin, is the most expensive weapons program in government history at over $1 trillion spent to date and, more recently, a source of financial diplomacy for the United States. Seven countries, including Canada and Italy, have partnered with the United States to build more of the jets in the future, and several other countries have signed up to receive their own planes.
Turkey, a NATO ally, used to be part of the F-35’s international program and “helped fund the development of the jet,” Defense News reported. But in July, the country was expelled from the partnership after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan agreed to purchase Russia’s S-400 missile defense system. That transaction “presented a risk that technological secrets from F-35s in Turkey could make their way to Russia,” the New York Times reported.
Ellen Lord, the Pentagon’s acquisition chief, told reporters at the time that Turkey’s role in producing hundreds of F-35 parts would be phased out by March 2020. “At this point the Turks have made a decision,” she said. “We have said that the F-35 and the S-400 are incompatible. We will work forward at this point to unwind the relationship.” (The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s tweet.)
Trump’s tweet seemed to conveniently forget that piece of recent history. Turkey had occupied a key part in the supply chain for building new F-35s. Without Turkey, the Pentagon has to now spend more money to spread out the costs of replacing them.

I was browsing around on Andrew Gelman’s blog and happened to come across these charts that he drew a couple of years ago. The subject is deaths of despair.
Anne Case and Angus Deaton famously found that the death rate of middle-aged whites had started to increase around the year 2000, and the media mostly reported this as a problem with middle-aged white men. Case and Deaton looked at causes of death and explained the increase as a sudden rise in “deaths of despair”: that is, a lot more deaths caused by suicide, drug overdoses, and alcohol problems.
But it turned out that Case and Deaton worked in age buckets (i.e., 25-35, 35-45, etc.) and hadn’t controlled for the fact that the average age within those buckets was steadily increasing. They also didn’t disaggregate by gender or region. When Gelman and Jonathan Auerbach did that, here’s what they found:
The upper left is the original chart for middle-aged whites. The next chart breaks it out by gender and finds that men suffered a brief bump around 2000, which turned around a few years laters and and ended up back where it started. Women, by contrast, saw their death rates steadily climb during the entire period.
Finally, looking only at women, there are no substantial increases in the Midwest, the West, or the Northeast. It’s all in the South, which had the highest death rate to begin with. Between 2000 and 2014, the death rate for middle-aged white women in the South went up from 0.31 percent to 0.37 percent.
It’s important to point out that the main problem reported by Case and Deaton remains powerful: even if most white Americans have experienced steady death rates (and life expectancies) since 2000, this compares poorly with the rest of the world, where life expectancies have continued to rise. There is obviously something bad going on that’s specific to the United States.
That said, the only group where death rates are literally rising are white women in the South. I’m mentioning this only because, to this day, I continue to see incorrect media references to this. If you’re comparing America to Europe, it’s fine to say that we’re performing worse across the board. But if you want to know where the biggest problem is, the answer is that it’s clearly focused on one specific group: middle-aged white women in the South.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Turnberry, located near Glasgow on the Firth of Clyde, has consistently bled money since Trump purchased the club for $60 million in 2014. Last year, per the filing, the course lost $13.1 million.
The bad news follows a recent decision by local planning authorities to deny a proposed expansion of the resort that would have allowed the Trump Organization to build luxury housing on a swath of  scenic property on the Scottish coastline. The development was believed to be the long-term plan for the resort’s financial viability, and the move to block it calls into question whether Turnberry will ever climb out of the red.
Trump’s other Scottish golf course, Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeenshire, last week reported $1.3 million in losses. That property has also yet to turn a profit since Trump opened it in 2012, though planning authorities did greenlight a plan by Trump to build homes and villas along that golf course. (That plan, however, specified it might take more than 10 years to actually start work on the project.)
The losses at Turnberry come as House Democrats investigate recent revelations that US Air Force flight crews stayed at President Trump’s luxury resort when they made refueling and rest stops at a nearby airport. The Pentagon reported that it spent at least $184,000 at Turnberry over the past two years.
The good news for the resort is that its revenues did increase last year, bringing in about $23.4 million in business, up from $18 million in 2017. But costs also rose, pushing the resort into the red. The club’s 2018 losses were almost three times higher than those in 2017, when the resort lost nearly $4.5 million. Since Trump purchased Turnberry, the club has lost about $58 million.
In Turnberry’s 2018 financial filing, Eric Trump, ostensibly head of the Trump Organization’s golf operations, tried to put a rosy spin on the latest numbers. He said in 2018 the club earned its highest revenues in its century-plus history. A letter from an auditor included in the filing concluded Turnberry “is dependent on continuing finance being made available by its ultimate owner to enable it to continue operating and to meet its liabilities as they fall due.” In other words, for Turnberry to keep its lights on, Donald Trump will have to continue loaning the resort money. To date, he has loaned more than $146 million to the club. The auditor noted that the Trump Organization has “confirmed that it will ensure all necessary financial support is provided to the group for the foreseeable future.”
Perhaps the biggest blow to the resort’s financial future is the denial of a request to rezone a large tract of farmland along the scenic Firth of Clyde coastline, directly adjoining the resort, to build as many as 87 new houses and a number of luxury villas. At many Trump-branded properties around the world, the development and sale of real estate has been far more profitable than the the resorts themselves.
The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment on the latest filing or its path to profitability at Turnberry.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In recent days, journalists—on both the left and right—have attempted to cast doubt on that story. The evidence they’ve assembled isn’t particularly compelling, and Warren has responded by saying that her statements are completely true. In a pair of tweets Tuesday, she asked readers to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination.

Warren’s tweets came a day after the conservative Washington Free Beacon published school board meeting minutes from Riverdale, New Jersey, where Warren was employed as an elementary school speech pathologist during the 1970-71 school year. The minutes state that board members unanimously voted to extend Warren’s teaching contract during an April meeting and that she resigned two months later in June.
Conservative publications from Fox News to the Washington Examiner to the New York Post picked up the story. So, too, did supporters of Bernie Sanders, Warren’s chief rival for progressive support in the Democratic primary.



CBS News, however, found evidence supporting Warren’s claims. Two retired Riverdale teachers said, according to the network, that “the workplace culture at the time may have left Warren with no option but to move on when her pregnancy became apparent.”
“The rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn’t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn’t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,” one of those retired teachers said. “But they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.”
The article notes that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which would protect a non-tenured teacher like Warren, was not passed until 1978, seven years after Warren’s teaching job ended.
Women (and historians) on Twitter pointed out that workplace discrimination is rarely explicitly documented in school board minutes, and that pregnancy discrimination was extremely common in the 1970s.

Sondland is our ambassador to the EU, but he’s not a career diplomat. He was rewarded with the job because he’s a big Trump donor and loyalist.
There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s traditional for high-profile US ambassadors to be political donors. And in this case it’s good for Trump: Sondland is surely likely to put a favorable spin on things when he testifies about Ukraine in front of three House committee. In fact, his lawyer said he was eager to testify voluntarily, and he had flown back from Brussels to appear this morning.
But at the last minute his appearance was squashed by the State Department. Why? Executive privilege? Lack of time to properly prepare? Concern over the possible release of classified material? Nope:

That’s right: Trump has ordered Sondland not to appear before the House because he thinks the House investigation is totally unfair. That’s a new one! And one of Trump’s most loyal spear carriers in the House completely agrees:
Actually, Volker gave them a whole lot of the answers they were looking for. Details here. Nonetheless, Sen. Lindsey Graham was also on the president’s side:
Translation: Forget about Trump’s actual corruption, we should be more concerned with hearing about made-up conspiracy theories regarding Ukraine and Democrats. And who better to provide that kind of thing than Rudy Giuliani?
For the record, our ambassador to Ukraine thought it was clear that we were holding up military aid to Ukraine until they agreed to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. This was also the understanding of Sen. Ron Johnson after he talked to Sondland. And it was certainly mighty suspicious that Trump held up the Ukraine aid and then instructed his aides to lie to Congress about why he was doing it. Still, Trump has totally denied that he did anything wrong, so that should be that. Right? Why bother investigating any further, especially in front of a committee run by Democrats who are clearly total hacks and completely unfair?
It’s too bad Democrats were unaware of this defense back in the day. It sure would have cut short a lot of unpleasantness. The next stop, I suppose, is a subpoena, which the White House will ignore and which Democrats will take to court. That should burn off several months of time and prevent any impeachment vote this year. Or so they hope.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Emily Zamourka says she learned to sing by imitating opera performers on TV while growing up in Russia. Decades later, with her belongings beside her, she began singing at a Los Angeles subway stop—and a police officer’s video of the scene got more than 1 million views.
The video also prompted a crowdfunding effort for the 52-year-old; efforts to find housing for her; and a paid gig on Saturday, singing the same Puccini aria at a Little Italy celebration.
Zamourka told the Los Angeles Times that she had battled through a series of health issues to teach piano and violin lessons, and had played violin on the street for extra cash—until a stranger took and broke her violin in downtown LA. After that, she rode the subways at night with her belongings.
Now, more than 2,100 strangers have contributed $77,000-plus to supplement the $400 a month in government aid she had lived on. A Grammy-nominated producer wants to give her a recording contract. One of several LA Times readers wrote in response to the stories: “She has already inspired many to cheer her on and to applaud her efforts to survive, ultimately to thrive and finally to triumph and share her gift.”

He has 18 more statues—carved from marble from Michelangelo’s preferred quarry—ready to dunk. Fanciulli, preaching his sustainable fishing mantra to tourists and fellow fishers, calls the underwater sculptures “the biggest museum in the world to save the sea.” (New York Times)

https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/syria-kurds/,2019-10-08,,,politics,"October 8, 2019",I Went to Syria and Met the People Trump Just Gave Turkey Permission to Kill,Shane Bauer,MotherJones,Syria,"This story is part of Shane Bauer’s investigation into what Americans—troops, militia volunteers, ISIS recruits, and others—are doing in Syria. Bauer, who lived in Syria in the late 2000s, traveled to the Kurdish and Syrian rebel-controlled parts of the country in 2018. The area he visited is where Kurdish fighters are now preparing to make their last stand after President Donald Trump announced that the United States would not stand in the way of a Turkish offensive against them.
At the headquarters of the Syrian Defense Forces in Hasaka, three white men in camouflage pull up in a pickup truck. The commander, a thirtysomething Frenchman with a closely shaved head, is driving. A somber, mustachioed Irishman is in the passenger seat. In the back, a skinny American who looks to be in his late 20s is sitting with an M16 nestled between his legs. He invites me to get in. “Where are you from?” I ask.
He asks that I call him Berxwedan, the Kurdish word for “resistance,” but to keep it simple, I’ll just call him Barry. Barry wears a black and red anarcho-syndicalist patch on the arm of his uniform. He and his comrades ask me not to take pictures, and they decline my request to visit their base in a town that was retaken from ISIS. Instead, we drive to a quiet kebab shop to talk.
Barry has been a volunteer fighter with the Kurdish YPG forces for more than the six months he’d signed up for. It is, he thinks, “the best thing someone who considers themselves a militant leftist can do right now with their life.” This is his first time in the Middle East. Back in the United States, Barry was part of the antifa movement. He would brawl with fascists, sometimes carrying a concealed gun to protests “just in case.” It was in these circles that Barry first heard about Rojava, the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in northeast Syria that has become a cause célèbre in anarchist circles. Its name means “the west,” referring to the western part of the stateless Kurdish homeland that straddles Syria, Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. Those governments have repressed the Kurds’ long-standing desire for independence, with measures ranging from a ban on the Kurdish language to Saddam Hussein’s extermination of as many as 182,000 Kurds in the 1980s.
The ideological inspiration for the Rojava project is Abdullah Öcalan, the founder of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). When Barry first encountered Öcalan’s writings back home, certain ideas spoke to him. For Öcalan, capitalism was an “inherent component” of the nation-state. What was needed, he argued, was “democracy without the state.” “I saw it as an anarchist revolution,” Barry tells me.
Today, it is nearly impossible to drive down a street in the Kurdish parts of Syria without seeing Öcalan’s face smiling through a bushy mustache. He is stenciled on walls, plastered on billboards, and stuck on cellphone cases. The United States considers his group a terrorist organization, but his image is often patched on the uniforms of the militiamen who guard coalition bases and carry weapons provided by the Americans.
In 1980, Öcalan fled his home in Turkey for Syria. The Assad regime was repressing the rights of its Kurdish population, but it allowed Öcalan to form training camps on Syrian soil. From there, his guerrillas directed attacks against Syria’s enemy Turkey in pursuit of establishing an independent Kurdish communist state. In 1997, the United States labeled the PKK  a terrorist organization, and the following year Hafez al-Assad kicked out Öcalan. With help from the CIA, Turkish intelligence captured him in Kenya in 1999.
Öcalan was sentenced to death for treason and separatism. His punishment was later commuted to life in prison, and for years he was held in solitary confinement as the only inmate of an island prison guarded by more than 1,000 military personnel. He read voraciously and became inspired by writers like Michel Foucault and Immanuel Wallerstein. None influenced him more than Murray Bookchin, an obscure anarchist thinker from Vermont. Bookchin criticized the traditional left for being slavishly bound to Karl Marx’s century-old class-centered ideas. (He once denounced Burlington Mayor Bernie Sanders as a “centralist” who ran a “civic oligarchy.”) His two dozen books had little to do with ethnic nationalism, Syria, or Turkey. Mostly, they mused about theoretical and political frameworks for the anti-authoritarian left.
Öcalan was particularly taken by Bookchin’s 1982 book, The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy, which proposed the creation of an egalitarian “ecological society.” In 2004, Öcalan wrote to Bookchin, seeking to apply his ideas to the Middle East. What interested Öcalan most was Bookchin’s ideology of communalism, in which central governments would be replaced by loose federations of autonomous communities. Öcalan wrote a new manifesto, Democratic Confederalism, which blended Bookchin’s ideas with those of the growing Kurdish feminist movement. (Bookchin died in 2006.) He also ordered his guerrillas to stop attacking the Turkish government. Rather than agitating for a communist state, Öcalan was now calling for a bottom-up system in which “decision-making processes lie with the communities.”
While Öcalan sat behind bars, his followers in Syria continued to organize. In 2003, they founded the Democratic Union Party (PYD), whose ideology was identical to the PKK’s, though it was shaped by their grievances against the Assads. Kurds were about 10 percent of Syria’s population, but 300,000 didn’t have citizenship, the result of an “Arabization” movement that started in the 1950s. Hafez al-Assad had relocated Kurds from villages near the Turkish border, creating an “Arab belt” to stymie nationalistic affinities between Syrian and Turkish Kurds. Schools could not teach the Kurdish language, and Kurdish children were made to recite an anthem that stressed that Syria was an Arab republic. Kurdish-language publications were banned, as were costumes and celebrations of Kurdish holidays.
PYD members took part in a short-lived uprising in Qamishli in 2004. The Syrian government arrested 2,000 people; many were tortured. Others went into hiding, and the party fell into obscurity in Syria, as did Öcalan’s ideas. Then, after the anti-Assad revolt broke out in 2011, PYD members returned home and organized militias.
It’s difficult to overstate how radically politics have been transformed in Rojava since its “self-administration” was formed in 2013. Rather than revolving around a single strongman or a central authority, the territory is organized into cantons, largely self-governing regions with their own decision-making councils and institutions. (Rojava’s three cantons are in the majority-­Kurdish areas bordering Turkey; the rest of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria is also divided into cantons.)
Each canton is split into neighborhood or village communes. Qamishli alone is made up of more than 150 communes. One that I visited encompassed 257 homes. Every two years, its residents elect a man and a woman who manage neighborhood concerns and meet with the co-chairs of other communes to address community issues. The commune sold gas for heating and cooking, managed health care, developed local economic projects, and helped reconcile neighborhood disputes. One commune I visited had recently helped reconcile a marital dispute and set up nighttime patrols to improve safety. Another was planning to install streetlights.
Probably the most dramatic effect of the Rojava revolution has been its impact on women. Every public institution, from communes to courts to canton ministries, is chaired by a man and a woman. The cantons require that at least 40 percent of all political positions are held by women. While Syrian law is based on Shariah, Rojava’s “social contract” separates religion and state. It has abolished forced marriage, polygamy, and child marriage. Educational programs for women encourage them to become more politically and socially engaged, and more women are working outside the home. Kurdish women also have their own military branch, the YPJ, where they fight on the front lines against ISIS.
For Barry, the idea of defending this radical experiment had a refreshing sense of urgency and moral clarity. The Occupy movement had petered out and the far-right-­wingers he and his antifa comrades had tussled with back home weren’t as stark of an enemy as ISIS. In 2017, Barry reached out to the YPG online and filled out an application for a stint as a volunteer fighter. “The US is the single biggest source country” for Western volunteers, his Irish companion tells me.
Barry and his comrades say 11 of the 40 or so foreigner shahids, or martyrs, have been Americans. (In comparison, as of early March 2019, four US soldiers had been killed in combat in Syria.) Not all the Americans who have joined the YPG are leftists. Some came because they wanted “to kill sand n‑‑‑‑‑s,” the Frenchman says. The Frenchman—I’ll call him Bastien—says the YPG has added questions to its vetting process to determine applicants’ political ideology. Some try to get around the restrictions. Bastien had one applicant who said that he was a centrist, but when he checked the applicant’s social media, he saw a bunch of racist and pro-Trump posts.
After Barry was accepted, he flew to Sulaimaniya, in Iraqi Kurdistan. On the way there, he was stopped and questioned for five hours by American officials at an airport outside the United States—he won’t say where. He says they looked up his criminal record, searched his old Facebook account, and let him go. “I think they were concerned I was joining Daesh,” he says, using an insulting term for ISIS. “They asked about how I felt about Islam, stuff like that.”
Barry probably doesn’t have much to worry about from the feds. A few American YPG fighters have been open about their stints in Syria, and so far, none has been prosecuted. Other American comrades were also approached by federal agents, Barry says. The agents didn’t warn them against fighting ISIS in Syria, but if they took up arms against Turkey, a NATO ally, they could be charged with terrorism.
There have been skirmishes between the Kurds and the government, but with ISIS mostly neutralized in Syria, Turkey is now the biggest threat to Rojava. The Turks consider the YPG a branch of their enemy, the PKK. In January 2018, the Turkish military and allied FSA brigades invaded Afrin—the only part of Rojava not under US protection—to take it from the YPG “terrorists.” The rest of Rojava would likely face a similar fate if the United States were to withdraw without any agreements to prevent a Turkish incursion.
After crossing secretly into Syria, Barry went through a month of military and ideological training with a group of foreign recruits. They read books on guerrilla tactics by Che Guevara, Mao Zedong, and Vietnamese General Võ Nguyên Giáp. One of the most popular books in his battalion was George Orwell’s Homage to Catalonia, which details Orwell’s experiences in a communist brigade fighting against Spanish fascists in the 1930s. They also read PKK texts.
When Barry finished training, he was sent to the front in Deir Ezzor. “It’s the last real pocket of Daesh left, so they are resisting hard,” he says. “This is the end for them.” Barry’s international battalion provides cover for SDF forces as they advance against ISIS.
Barry’s commanders call in aerial strikes from American jets, and many of his YPG comrades got their weapons from the Pentagon as part of a more than $2.2 billion effort to arm and train groups fighting ISIS. Yet Barry disdains the US military. “They have no allegiance to the Kurds,” he says. “They have allegiance to their own nation because it looks good to the people to fight Daesh and because they are afraid of what Daesh is gonna do to white people in America. The only reason they care about YPG at this point is because we’re the best vehicle to fight a common enemy. That’s all.”
Bastien says the destruction of ISIS’s capital city, Raqqa, by coalition jets in 2017 was worth it. “I don’t like easy historical comparisons, but you know what Germany looked like after the war? That kind of stuff, you have to do it. The bombing, yeah. It was a lot, but what can you do? It was Daesh. It’s easy afterward, when you are sitting in New York or something, to say yeah, they should have bombed a little bit less. Come, take a rifle, fight, take bullets, and then we gonna speak again.”
It is undeniable that the Kurdish forces’ relationship with the United States has turned the Rojava project into something more than an attempt at direct democracy and Kurdish self-rule. Until 2015, the YPG was concerned mainly with keeping other militant groups out of Kurdish areas. After US special forces intervened to keep ISIS from taking the Kurdish city of Kobanî, the Pentagon began a formal alliance with the YPG, supplying them with weapons and planning joint operations involving coalition airstrikes. The problem was that by partnering with the YPG, the United States was strengthening the enemy of a NATO ally. “We literally played back to [the YPG] that you’ve got to change your brand,” Special Operations Command General Raymond “Tony” Thomas recounted at the Aspen Security Forum in 2017. “And with about a day’s notice they declared that they were the Syrian Democratic Forces. I thought it was a stroke of brains to put ‘democracy’ in there somewhere.” According to Thomas, the SDF included 50,000 fighters who “are working for us and doing our bidding.” That thousands of these proxies—and not Americans—had died in combat was the “unstated aspect of the magic” of the campaign against ISIS in Syria.
Barry realized quickly after arriving in Syria that his “decision to come out was kind of romanticized.” Rojava was not the anarchist revolution he’d imagined. He was disappointed that it still had political parties and elections—the trappings of a state. Still, he views the Rojava revolution and the YPG’s tactical alliance with the United States as part of a larger anti-capitalist struggle. The old Marxist paradigm for dismantling capitalism held that the working class should rise against the ruling class, he explains. “But capitalism is a global economy now, so the workers are not the people in tenements in America as it used to be. They are in places such as Latin America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. So to effectively fight capitalism, I felt that I needed to go to a place where the workers are throwing off capitalism.”
When I press Barry on different aspects of the revolution, he confesses he knows little about it. “We are stuck on the front line,” he says. “We don’t have time to have extended political conversations.” There are many foreigners who have fought in Syria who could say the same. Some see the country as the embryo of a global anti-capitalist revolution. Others see it as a drawing board for their vision of an Islamist state. Some didn’t speak the language or know much about the country before they came here. They are soldiers, projecting fantasies onto Syria to find meaning in their war.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In a report released Tuesday, the committee endorsed an Intelligence Community assessment issued in the last days of the Obama administration that Russian interference was intended to benefit Trump, a conclusion the president has never accepted.
The conclusion marks a subtle shift by GOP senators on the committee. In 2017 and since, many have argued Russia aimed primarily to create division in the United States, not to help Trump. In November 2018, committee chair Richard Burr (R-N.C.) downplayed the evidence of assistance to Trump, complaining that people “have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,” adding that “this story does not simplify that easily.” Tuesday’s report still says the IRA’s broader goal of interfering in the 2016 election was to “sow discord in American politics and society.” But the Senate report dispenses with the argument that effort did not also entail support for Trump, detailing the role of the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin backed troll farm, in a campaign designed to benefit his campaign.
Most IRA content did not overtly back one candidate or another, according to the report, but was instead used for “establishing the credibility of their online personas.” Operatives created content that painted the picture of a southern conservative or a liberal activist “until the opportune moment arrived,” the report says. The profiles then used their credibility with like-minded voters to deliver a message designed “to influence the targeted user.” For instance, IRA operatives created an “Army of Jesus” Facebook page, which eventually gained 216,000 followers. After pumping out apolitical religious content, the page on November 1, 2016, declared: “HILLARY APPROVES REMOVAL OF GOD FROM THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.”
The report also notes that Russian efforts to use social media to manipulate American politics likely haven’t stopped. The committee cites a 2018 federal indictment charging a IRA employee of attempting to interfere with the 2018 midterm elections. Another section of the report warns that future Russian disinformation efforts may be focused on “gathering data points”—such as phone numbers, email addresses, or banking details—that could help target interference efforts aimed at the 2020 presidential election, according to research the committee cited by Graphika, a private firm.
The report urged President Trump to establish an interagency task force to “monitor and asses foreign country’s use of social media platforms for democratic interference.” Other recommendations include federally funded media literacy programs to “build long-term resilience to foreign manipulation,” and more disclosure from intelligence officials about potential political interference. It also recommends the administration “reinforce with the public the danger of attempted foreign interference in the 2020 election.”
“Between now and the 2020 election, the Intelligence Community must find ways to keep the U.S. public informed not only of individual influence operations but the Community’s assessment of the goals and intent of Russia and other foreign adversaries,” the report concluded.
Perhaps the most memorable portion of the report is a section quoting a message written by an IRA employee obtained by the committee, where they describe the scene in his office on Election Day: “On November 9, 2016, a sleepless night was ahead of us. And when around 8 a.m. the most important result of our work arrived, we uncorked a tiny bottle of champagne.. took one gulp each and looked into each other’s eyes….We uttered almost in unison: ”We made America great.'”

“The attempt to carve out discrimination against men for being gay from Title VII cannot be administered with either consistency or integrity,” Karlan said. “In the words of the en banc Second Circuit, it forces judges to…resort to lexical bean counting where they count up the frequency of epithets, such as “fag,” “gay,” “queer,” “real man,” and “fem,” to determine whether or not discrimination is based on sex or sexual orientation.”

Nixon refused to hand them over, but the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that he had to comply. A couple of weeks later Nixon resigned.
For a while, that was that: the court had spoken, and presidents had to comply with congressional subpoenas for use in a criminal trial. A generalized interest in confidentiality was not enough to override a legitimate judicial need.
This was a landmark case, but the Trump administration says it’s hokum:


Apparently the Trump argument is that the grand jury materials would be really helpful to the Democrats pressing for impeachment, so they should be held back. Judge Howell seems unpersuaded, but I’m sure the Trumpies don’t care. She’s just an Obama flunky anyway and obviously prejudiced against them. They’ll just appeal, and then appeal again.

On Thursday, Mayela, the only trans women at the encampment, told me she feared for her life as she waited for her December court date across the Rio Grande in Brownsville, Texas. “I don’t want to become another statistic,” she said over WhatsApp. “Another one who showed up dead.”
When the Department of Homeland Security started forcing asylum seekers to wait out their cases in Mexico earlier this year, the department said it would exempt members of “vulnerable populations” on a case-by-case basis. In practice, getting out of the Migrant Protection Protocols, the policy’s official name, has proved almost impossible. Among the more than 50,000 people who have been forced back under MPP—or Remain in Mexico, as it’s often called—are pregnant women and members of the LGBTQ community. Reuters reported this summer that only about 1 percent of migrants subjected to the policy had been able to get out of it to fight their cases from within the United States.
On Monday, Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro went to Matamoros to try to get eight LGBTQ asylum seekers, a deaf woman, and three of her relatives removed from MPP. In an interview with my colleague Fernanda Echavarri, Castro called what he saw at the encampment a “humanitarian disaster.” The State Department tells Americans not to travel to Tamaulipas, the state Matamoros is in, because of crime and kidnapping. At least 343 people returned to Mexico under MPP have been threatened or violently attacked, according to an October report from Human Rights First.
Along with Mayela, I spoke last week with two other LGBTQ women stuck in Matamoros. A lesbian from Honduras, who asked to remain anonymous, sent a photo of a split lip that came from being hit in the face by an unknown assailant. Mari, a Cuban asylum seeker, said two men had threatened her and her partner, Dany, when they went to buy cigarettes. One of the men also grabbed her during the altercation, Mari said. They also faced discrimination from fellow asylum seekers. When the Cuban couple bathed in the Rio Grande, people moved away from them, and they kept their tent apart from the heterosexual migrants.
Mony Ruiz-Velasco, the executive director of PASO, a social-justice organization in Illinois, tried to remove the three women, along with three others, from MPP over Labor Day weekend. After Ruiz-Velasco explained to the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) port director why the group members were at risk, he agreed to take them into custody. “I’ve been doing immigration law for 20 years, and I’ve never been happy about someone being taken into custody,” Ruiz-Velasco says. But in this case, she was thrilled that they’d have a chance to get out of MPP. After she got back to Chicago, Ruiz-Velasco learned that all of them had been sent back to Mexico.
MPP gives individual CBP officials broad discretion over whether to allow people into the United States, but they’ve rarely exercised that authority. Asylum seekers can also get out of MPP if an asylum officer decides that they are “more likely that not” to be persecuted in Mexico, a much higher standard than the one used in regular asylum interviews, which only require that a person establish a “significant possibility” of persecution. And unlike those asylum interviews, migrants don’t have access to lawyers during the Remain in Mexico screenings or the right to appeal the decisions. The union that represents asylum officers has said its members are being forced to enact a policy that is “fundamentally contrary to the moral fabric of our Nation.”
Mayela had similar experiences to the other LGBTQ women in Matamoros. In late September, a woman came to her tent and threatened to cut out her guts with a knife, according to a complaint Mayela submitted to the Mexican government. In the line for food at the camp, fellow migrants told her she had to wait in the men’s line and sometimes used slurs. Mayela told me that waiting in the United States—even if it meant being in a detention center—would be “a thousand times better” than the constant fear of being killed in Matamoros.
On Saturday, Jodi Goodwin, a Texas attorney leading much of the fight against MPP in Brownsville, accompanied Mayela across the bridge and into US custody. Goodwin learned the next day that the Department of Homeland Security was taking Mayela out of MPP. Mayela had passed her screening interview. It was the first and only time Goodwin has seen that happen in Brownsville. Instead of waiting in Matamoros, Mayela will be able to live with an aunt in Houston while she waits for her court dates.
On Monday, Julián Castro escorted Dany, Mari, and Melissa, along with the nine other asylum seekers, to the Customs and Border Protection officials stationed on the bridge. Like Mayela, they were taken into custody and interviewed about whether they were likely to be persecuted in Mexico. Hours later, all 12 were sent back to Mexico. The Texas Civil Rights Project, which has been working with the people Castro accompanied, said in a statement, “If these people—LGBTQ migrants who have been assaulted for who they are in the camps, disabled people, children—do not meet the criteria for ‘vulnerable populations,’ then the ‘vulnerable’ exemptions in ‘Remain in Mexico’ are lip service.”
“Now more than ever I’m convinced MPP is not about protecting us,” Dany told BuzzFeed News. “It’s about wearing you down so you don’t fight your asylum case in court.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In a way, I suppose that’s not surprising. What is surprising—a little bit, I guess—is that they’ve announced their intentions via a letter from the White House counsel that reads like a Rush Limbaugh monologue, not a legal document.
You can read the whole thing here, but allow me to summarize the three numbered sections:
This is batshit insane. Due process is for the impeachment trial, not the initial inquiry. The political motivation for impeachment is irrelevant. And the whole point of the inquiry is to establish whether Trump did anything wrong. The fact that Trump himself says he did nothing wrong is hardly conclusive evidence.
But this letter was plainly not written with legal arguments in mind. No lawyer would do anything but laugh at it. Rather, it’s aimed at Trump’s base and, especially, Fox News. It provides them with approved talking points going forward, and I expect to hear versions of these talking points 24/7 throughout conservative media for weeks to come.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

And that has never been more apparent than in the past couple of weeks, when the details of a phone call between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—in which Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son in exchange for foreign aid—sparked an impeachment inquiry into the president. Just like with every other scandal President Trump has been involved in, he has dismissed each emerging detail about the Ukraine call as “fake news” or a “witch hunt.” And that go-to defense—to blatantly lie or dismiss proven facts as “pure fiction”—is echoed by his administration, allies, and base like never before.
So far, Trump has made 12,019 “false or misleading claims” since he’s been in office, according to the Washington Post. But while facts don’t matter to the president, they do matter to the public, and with the prevalence of so much disinformation being spread out in the world—from the Ukraine scandal to right-wing conspiracy theories such as the deep state, Q Anon, Pizzagate, and others—the role of fact-checking in the media has never been so vital. But how effective is fact-checking for dissuading the spread of misinformation, especially in the world of broadcast news? When cable news anchors like CNN’s Jake Tapper or MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow confront and challenge Trump administration officials on false claims live on air, does that actually change people’s views on issues like immigration, climate change, or Russia’s role in Trump’s election? Put simply: Do facts matter, or are people just going to believe what they want to believe?
To find out, I spoke with Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College who focuses on misperceptions in politics, about the role of fact-checking in media.
How effective is on-air fact-checking?
That’s a good question. I think that approach of aggressive fact-checking on television and interviews with newspapers is a good idea. What people believe can be confusing and emotional to an average person when there are competing claims going back and forth that may be hard to sort out. So it’s easy to imagine people relying on their partisan priors as far as what side to believe in the moment.
But I would make two points: The first is, in general, the cumulating body of research that’s out there suggests that fact-checking can help improve belief accuracy on the margin. It’s not a fantasy that people do tend to move in the direction of the information that they’re given, in terms of the effect on their beliefs. So, it does help. Fact-checking should, on average, improve the accuracy of people’s beliefs.

The other point, though, is that live fact-checking in particular may help deter elites from overrating the importance of fact-checking as a response to misinformation, and underrate it as a way to deter elites from promoting this information in the first place. So if you’re going to go on TV and be embarrassed for saying false things, you might not make those claims in the first place, because the extent to which the media will not tolerate the kind of open dissembling that we’ve so often seen from figures in this administration will influence their calculations going forward about what they will say. Trump himself, obviously, is undeterred, but other figures in the administration may be more sensitive to how they’re covered. Even Trump might be more extreme if he weren’t fact-checked so aggressively.
The other thing is live fact-checking sends a cue to other members of the media about what kinds of falsehoods are being promoted and encourages them to similarly hold those claims up to scrutiny in their own reporting. The kinds of people who watch Jake Tapper are political junkies and news obsessive—they’re not normal people by default. If they’re watching cable news at 4 in the afternoon, they’re a very small minority of Americans. But those clips reach a larger set of journalists who, in turn, are providing news coverage that is reaching a much broader swath of the public. And in that way, fact-checking can have a more important cumulative effect.
What’s the best way for live fact-checking? Is the aggressive Jake Tapper way of confronting his guests into submission more or less effective than others?
I’d like to see news organizations being judicious about the extent to which they put people on air in the first place. Live fact-checking is a difficult enterprise and it’s one that people have a tough time doing effectively. Running video of the president talking is cheap. And it’s interesting to people, so there’s a temptation to do it. If you’re equipped to engage in effective live fact-checking, then I think that can be an appropriate news decision, but I think there needs to be a rethinking of just taking live video when you’re not prepared to adequately scrutinize it for your viewers.
And the same thing with these confrontational interviews. Every so often it’s important to plant a flag and challenge the talking points that are being offered on something important. But at some point it becomes a pointless exercise. Many organizations seem to have stopped booking Kellyanne Conway for this reason, because the interviews with her became kind of Dada nonsense-type conversations. There was no news value.
I’m starting to feel like it’s getting that way with Rudy Giuliani. It seems like shows are booking him more because he’s going to say something crazy than an actual value-add to the impeachment conversation.
Right. This is where the public service goals and the ratings orientation of the media are in direct conflict. It’s hard to imagine most cable news food fights informing people, but having Rudy Giuliani on will get people to tune in and create viral clips and bring more attention to your show, and so of course there’s incentive to keep booking him. Look, the media has to get serious. We’re talking about the impeachment of the president of the United States. The stakes are extremely high here and I think there’s a temptation to just treat it all as silliness and a food fight, but this is deadly serious. And journalists have to do their job.
I think it’s important to note, though, the media has been more aggressive in fact-checking during this administration than any time in my adult lifetime. While in some ways the media has not gone far enough, they’ve come a long way. This administration has pushed them to rethink approaches that were previously accepted. It was very rare to see wide fact-checking on cable news prior to this administration. And the kinds of confrontation interviews we’ve seen with Stephen Miller and Kellyanne Conway were much more rare in the past than they have been under this administration. So I do think the media, in some ways, is rising to the challenge, but that challenge is so profound that more needs to be done.

What comes to mind when you think of a good example of on-air fact-checking? What more can be done by the media?
There’s a couple of different models. CNN and MSNBC, in some cases, will have their anchor break in and clarify. In other cases, they’ll run graphics next to the video debunking what President Trump or other speakers are saying. In other cases, the chyron itself will contain a fact-check of the statement the speaker is making, and then that’s hopefully affirmed after the statement is aired, so that viewers are left with accurate information. So, there’s a number of different models.
In some ways, the worst coverage of this administration has not been the fact-checking itself—which, when it’s done, I think generally has been laudable—it’s the “Trump said X” style of coverage, which is still quite common because it’s cheap and easy and fast. So, Trump tweets something and it’s immediately amplified across the spectrum—on Facebook, on websites, and sometimes straight on to the television. It’s often the case that those initial reports on whatever Trump claimed lacked context or fact-checking. Maybe down the road that kind of context is added, but of course people may not be exposed to those follow-up reports. We’ve seen this pattern for a long time, that those initial reports get the most coverage, and the follow-ups saying, “Actually, the truth is something else,” get much less.

Amid the outcry, the president offered his self-described “great and unmatched wisdom” as reassurance that he would take action against Turkey if the country did anything “off limits.”

In a string of earlier tweets, Trump acknowledged the Kurdish role but appeared to argue that the Kurds had already been fairly compensated. Trump’s decision amounts to what many see as a stunning betrayal of a crucial ally, as Turkey has long viewed Kurdish forces as a terrorist organization. “The move marks a major shift in US foreign policy and effectively gives Turkey the green light to attack US-backed Kurdish forces,” according to CNN.
“The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,” Trump said. “They have been fighting Turkey for decades. I held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.”

“I hope I’m making myself clear how short-sighted and irresponsible this decision is,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the president’s fiercest allies, said during a call with Fox & Friends. In a scathing thread, Brett McGurk, the former special envoy in the US’s fight against ISIS, slammed the president:

Trump’s lawyers are appealing the ruling.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. sought Trump’s tax returns while investigating whether the president, or his company, broke any New York State laws by reimbursing his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for hush fund payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, the New York Times reported. Cohen is currently serving a three-year prison sentence for campaign finance violations, fraud, and perjury.
In a 75-page ruling, federal Judge Victor Marrero rejected Trump’s claims of immunity to federal investigation, calling them “repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values.”
The Founding Fathers repudiated the notion that the president is above the law, Marrero wrote.
“The President asserts an extraordinary claim in the dispute now before this Court,” Marrero wrote. “He contends that, in his view of the President’s duties and functions and the allocation of governmental powers between the executive and the judicial branches under the United States Constitution, the person who serves as President, while in office, enjoys absolute immunity from criminal process of any kind.”

Trump’s announcement is a big win for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and it has already enraged many in American national security circles—including Trump allies—who say it reverses years of US policy. Kurdish leaders are being more blunt, saying it qualifies as a betrayal.
Whatever else it may be, Trump’s policy toward Turkey is also a significant conflict of interest, as Trump himself has admitted. In 2015, while running for president, Trump gave an interview to Stephen Bannon, not yet his campaign manager, in which he talked about Turkey. Right away, he admitted that his business interests in the country would make it difficult for him to deal with Turkey with a clear mind.
“I have a little conflict of interest ’cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul,” Trump told Bannon during a Breitbart radio show. “It’s a tremendously successful job. It’s called Trump Towers—two towers, instead of one, not the usual one, it’s two.”
Those Trump Towers are a pair of glass buildings in Istanbul that have borne Trump’s name since 2012. Trump doesn’t own the buildings—the situation might be less complicated if he did. Instead, Trump licenses his brand to the building’s actual owner, Turkish business magnate Aydin Dogan, who has been described as the single largest payer of taxes in Turkey. He’s a one-time antagonist of Erdogan who is now in step with the strongman.
The conflict of interest and the way it could affect Trump’s position on important issues—or at least the perception of how it could affect his position—quickly became obvious after Trump made this comment. In June 2016, after Trump said he supported a ban on immigration by people from countries he said were associated with Islamic terrorism—he called them “terror countries”—Erdogan objected, and so did Dogan, and both threatened to remove Trump’s name from the buildings.
That’s no small threat—according to personal financial disclosures filed by Trump, since he launched his bid for the presidency, he has earned somewhere between $3.2 million and $17 million in royalties from the deal. (The amounts are given in ranges; the precise figures are unclear.)
Less than a month after the threat to remove his name was made, Trump very publicly voiced support for Erdogan when the Turkish leader faced a coup attempt. And his closeness with Erdogan has continued, even over the objections of some of Trump’s most reliable supporters. For instance, in May 2017, when Erdogan visited Washington, D.C., for a White House visit, Turkish agents violently attacked protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence—shoving past local police officers to do so. Video showed Erdogan calmly watching the attack from his car. Although the House of Representatives, then under GOP control, voted 397-0 to condemn the attacks, Trump refused to do so. A few months later, Trump praised Erdogan, describing him as “a very good friend” and saying he gets “very high marks” for the way he runs Turkey.
What’s more, the relationship between Erdogan and Trump’s partner, Dogan, is not an even one. Although Dogan is one of Turkey’s wealthiest men, he is not nearly as powerful as Erdogan. In 2009, as part of what was described in press reports as a feud between the two men, Dogan’s company was fined $2.5 billion for tax violations. At the time, the media empire controlled by Dogan was widely seen as critical of Erdogan; the Turkish president characterized Dogan’s publications as “newspapers that print lies.” Dogan later settled the tax case, and Erdogan attended the opening of the Trump Towers in 2012.
When he ran for office, Trump said he would handle conflicts of interest like this by turning over his businesses to his children. He didn’t. Instead, he simply stepped away from the daily operations of his business empire, but he retains full ownership of almost all of the assets, including the licensing company that collects royalties from Dogan.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The federal income tax code, of course, remains progressive. But it’s no longer progressive enough to make up for payroll taxes and local sales taxes, which have always been regressive. As a result, conservatives have finally reached their dream of a flat tax by stealth. It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, doesn’t it?",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

It made three points:
This is simple, straightforward, and true. Needless to say, the ad leaves out quite a bit. Like the fact that the prosecutor in question was brazenly corrupt. And that everyone from the IMF to the EU wanted him gone before they’d commit any more aid money to Ukraine. And his claims about why he was fired are laughable.
Nonetheless, those three bullet points are narrowly true. This is why it’s going to be hard to persuade Trump supporters to turn on Trump. We can’t fight this ad by saying it’s a lie. We can only fight it by adding more detail, and that’s a tough thing to do. Three bullet points are about all that even an honest but low-information voter has time for.

Attorneys Mark Zaid and Andrew Bakaj at the DC firm Compass Rose Legal Group together represent both whistleblowers.


The first whistleblower’s complaint was based in large part on second-hand information. Attacks on the whistleblower from President Donald Trump and his allies have focused on this fact, dismissing the complaint as “hearsay.” But according to Zaid, this second whistleblower has first-hand knowledge of Trump’s Ukraine dealings.

Ron Johnson Had a Meltdown on “Meet the Press”,Pema Levy,MotherJones,Politics,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) gave a wild performance on “Meet the Press” Sunday, refusing to answer questions posed by host Chuck Todd, instead peddling unfounded conspiracy theories about the 2016 election. The bizarre interview is a demonstration of how President Donald Trump’s allies have responded to the impeachment inquiry by rallying around debunked theories about Democratic plots and deep state set-ups during the 2016 election, while dismissing the findings of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference.
Johnson’s refusal to answer questions, paired with Todd’s dismay that Johnson was embracing conspiracy theories, may also explain why other Trump allies refused to go on the Sunday news shows. In the midst of a tumultuous impeachment inquiry, no administration official or GOP leader from the House or Senate accepted an invitation to appear on any of the weekends news programs.
The interview went south at the very beginning. Rather than answer Todd’s first question about Ukraine, Johnson began his appearance with a jumble of old, debunked theories in which Johnson, reading from a paper on which he had prepared his comments, seemed to claim that former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI director James Comey had framed Trump. “Senator, I have no idea why Fox News propaganda stuff is popping up on here,” Todd said in response.
Johnson went on to defend Trump by putting forward a far-right conspiracy theory that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee worked with Ukrainians in 2016 to defeat Trump—this is the conspiracy theory which Trump seems to believe and which Attorney General Bill Bar and US Attorney John Durham are trying to substantiate both in Ukraine and through meetings with intelligence officials from multiple other countries. “I don’t know to what extent the Ukrainians” interfered in the 2016 elections, Johnson said. “I don’t know to what extent [the] DNC and [the] Hillary Clinton campaign were involved in kind of juicing up the Ukrainian involvement.”

Johnson is the senator most enmeshed in the Ukraine scandal. As the chairman of the Senate subcommittee with jurisdiction over the region, Johnson attended the inauguration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in May, alongside Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who stepped in after Vice President Mike Pence dropped out of the trip. In August, the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sonland, told Johnson that Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country’s leadership to undertake investigations desired by the president. Johnson was troubled by this, and asked Trump about it on a phone call on August 31. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Johnson says that Trump vehemently denied the quid pro quo. In his interview with Todd, Johnson repeated Trump’s denial.
But text messages released last week between Sonland and top diplomats show that the officials working on Ukraine believed aid was linked to a request for politically expedient investigations. “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” Bill Taylor, a top US diplomat in Ukraine, texted Sonland.
During his “Meet the Press” interview, Johnson denied that Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate his opponents ahead of the 2020 elections—despite the significant public evidence to the contrary, including the fact that Trump explicitly asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in the summary of the July 25 call.
When Todd pressed Johnson on whether he trusts the FBI and the CIA, Johnson said no, citing people who are no longer in those agencies like Strzok, Comey, and other career officials whom Republicans claim—in yet another conspiracy theory—tried to frame Trump as part of a deep state plot in 2016. “Do you trust them now?” Todd repeatedly asked. Johnson refused to answer the question.

Now, Solomon is making his alliance with pro-Trump forces official by joining Fox News as a contributor, according to the Washington Examiner and Mediaite.
Solomon, who was a columnist at the Hill until last week, was already making frequent appearances on Fox show, including Trump friend Sean Hannity’s show, where he pushed the pro-Trump Ukraine narrative. Those appearances have helped Trump’s theories about Ukraine gain credence on the right and made Solomon a figure of interest in the impeachment inquiry.
The whistleblower, who’s complaint set off the current impeachment inquiry, included Solomon’s work in the complaint. “Beginning in late March 2019, a series of articles appeared in an online publication called The Hill,” one section of the complaint begins. Those articles gave voice to false narratives, including the debunked claim that Biden used his power as vice president to quash an investigation into a gas company where his son Hunter was a board-member, a now-retracted allegation that the former ambassador to Ukraine gave a Ukrainian prosecutor a list of people not to prosecute, and that the US embassy in Kiev had blocked Ukrainian prosecutors from delivering “evidence” about 2016 to US officials.
Throughout the spring, Solomon became part of a campaign by Trump and Giuliani to gin up the Ukraine conspiracies. A main source for him was then the prosecutor general of Ukraine, Yuriy Lutsenko, who was also sharing information with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s private attorney and the lead instigator of Trump’s Ukraine-related conspiracies. Lutsenko was known as an untrustworthy opportunist whose contacts with Giuliani and Solomon came as Ukrainian elections put his own career at risk. Solomon would discuss his stories on Fox, where they were picked up and trumpeted by the president, Donald Trump Jr., and Giuliani.

Solomon began his career as an investigative reporter, including stints at the Washington Post. But in recent years, his work at the Hill has made him a favorite of the right while the rest of the media has noted his inaccuracies and tendency to push false narratives. Solomon produced multiple stories about the debunked Uranium One scandal. In 2017, he co-authored a story about attorney Lisa Bloom trying to secure payments for women considering coming forward to accuse Trump of assault that portrayed the women as out for money, which prompted a complaint from his colleagues to management. The Daily Beast described Solomon as a “one-man conservative investigative unit.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z
https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/the-trump-administration-has-figured-out-how-to-get-rid-of-federal-workers-without-firing-them/,2019-10-05,,,politics,"October 7, 2019",The Trump Administration Has Figured out How to Get Rid of Federal Workers Without Firing Them,Nathalie Baptiste,MotherJones,Politics,"“It’s nearly impossible to fire a federal worker,” acting White House chief of staff and budget chief Mick Mulvaney told the audience at a South Carolina Republicans’ dinner in August. “I know that because a lot of them work for me, and I’ve tried. You can’t do it.”
But Mulvaney reassured his audience that the Trump administration seems to have found a loophole. “By simply saying to people, ‘You know what? We’re going to take you outside the bubble, outside the Beltway, outside this liberal haven of Washington, DC, and move you out to the real part of the country,’ and they quit,” he explained. “What a wonderful way to sort of streamline government and do what we haven’t been able to do for a long time.”
Mulvaney was referring to the June announcement from Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, when he told 181 staff members at the USDA’s Economic Research Service office that in just three months they would be relocated to new offices over one-thousand miles away in Kansas City, Missouri. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture, another small scientific agency at USDA, would also be moving to the midwest. ERS conducts research on agriculture and economics, and Perdue said the move would help the staff be closer to midwestern farming regions and save taxpayer dollars. In return, officials in Kansas City offered $26 million in incentives, but Perdue refused to disclose the details. The workers could either uproot their lives and move or lose their government jobs.
The announcement was met with shock. The deadline to decide whether or not an employee was moving to Kansas City expired on September 30, but the union negotiated the option for employees to request another 60-day extension. It appears that most had already made their decision before the deadline. Of the 181 employees told to relocate, only 16 did. Another 24 will remain in their positions in DC. But a whopping 141 employees, or 78 percent, left ERS completely. The relocation also resulted in the number of women working in research and administrative positions dropping. According to data provided to Mother Jones, women made up 36 percent of the employees before the move. Now, that number is down to 30 percent. The numbers are even more striking in Kansas City. Of the 27 people working there, only one is a woman.
“None of us believed it would happen,” Laura Dodson, the acting Vice President of the ERS union, told me. “He didn’t have the authority, it wasn’t backed by Congress, and every scientist in our field said don’t [move the office.]” The USDA inspector general issued a report saying that while Perdue had the legal authority to move the offices, congressional approval is needed before any agency can be reorganized. Perdue argued that that provision was unconstitutional and forged ahead.
Those who left were not necessarily giving up large salaries or a flashy job, what they did lose was security. The salaries for civil servants range from more than $19,000 to around $138,000, but federal employment also is accompanied by generous retirement packages and quality health care. Today, 364,000 federal government employees call the Washington, DC, metropolitan area home. Since Reagan insisted “government is the problem,” federal employees have been demonized by those on the right, and the Trump administration has been no exception. Donald Trump campaigned on “draining the swamp,” and that effort appears to include debilitating the civil service in government agencies. “It was done with malice,” Dodson argues. “They intended for us to leave.”
One of those employees who opted to leave is Laura Tiehen, a senior economics researcher who had been with the agency for just over 20 years but did not want to retire. Tiehen recalls that she and her colleagues first realized something was amiss in August 2018, when the ERS administrator, Tiehen’s boss who was a career civil servant and not a political appointee, sent an email saying she was being relocated to a different USDA agency. “It was very clearly not her decision,” Tiehen explains, “tons of rumors were flying around.” Two hours later Tiehen received an email from Secretary Perdue. Their office would be relocating within a year, but he offered no details.
When the government shut down for six weeks at the end of 2018 into early 2019, Tiehen and her colleagues felt confident that the Trump administration would not be able to orchestrate such a move in what was becoming an increasingly short time frame. But then came the June 13 announcement that made it official. “You have about two-and-a-half months to pull up your roots, get your spouse a job, get your kids in school,” Tiehen says, “it was just an absolutely shock.”
J. David Cox, the national president of the federal employees’ union the American Federation of Government Employees, said in June, “The USDA has provided no rational justification to employees, to Congress, or to its stakeholders for this move, which will make it harder for the agencies to coordinate with other science and research agencies,” He also called the relocation a “backdoor way to slash the workforce and silence the parts of the agencies’ research that the administration views as inconvenient.” Which, presumably would mean any research on SNAP benefits for low-income households or scientific research on climate change, both of which the ERS studied.
Tiehen has family members in Kansas City and contemplated moving, but her husband who works at the National Institutes for Health would have had to give up his job as well. “It was an agonizing decision,” she says about taking early retirement from a job she truly enjoyed. “Given the hastiness and recklessness of the move, it just didn’t feel like an agency where I’d still feel like I had a fulfilling job.” When she left, she was working on a database on how states are administering the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food program for low-income and elderly people. “A lot of researchers rely on it,” she says.
ERS staffers work on studies that deal with agriculture, economics, and food security. The employees left behind dozens of unfinished reports and studies—some may never be completed. A memo circulated to ERS higher-ups, first reported by Politico, describes a large number of reports that will be delayed. Those studies include one that looks into food security for military veterans of working age, the impact of the opioid crisis, and the impact of food stamps in the post-recession era. The final decision was made so abruptly, that no plans were put in place to figure out how to finish certain projects.
“We all knew this move made no sense and was driven by ideology over science,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) in August. “Secretary Perdue has some serious questions to answer, and this fight is not over.”
In the past, the notion of decentralizing the federal government enjoyed some bipartisan support. “This idea has been used to make government work better, and sometimes it’s been used to destroy government,” David Fontana, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University says. Some conservatives like the idea because they see it as a way to slash government; progressives also have supported it as a strategy for spreading power and resources more evenly throughout the country. “It needs to be a deliberate process,” Fontana explains. “Not just why, but the where too. The process is different if you’re moving to Colorado, or Oklahoma, or New York City.” In contrast to the way this was handled at USDA, it would also be wiser to phase in the relocation and give employees an option, even if this means that the government would “create a new outpost and not ask anyone to move,” he says.
In shrinking the federal government, as in most things, the Trump administration has not opted for the incremental approach. And USDA isn’t the only agency Trump officials have disrupted. In July, the acting Bureau of Land Management director William Perry Pendley announced most of the employees at the agency would be relocated to Grand Junction, Colorado. Pendley has not been approved by the Senate for the role. As E&E News reported last month, the relocation announcement was met with disdain:
But officials may want to rethink their plans to hastily relocate BLM employees. After the mass exodus, the administrators at ERS is now forced to ask certain employees to come back for a short period of time, and that includes Tiehen. She was asked to return “in the short-term to close some of the gaps” but is still deciding if she will. Meanwhile, the ERS office in DC is down to just a handful of people. “I was just walking through the halls,” Dodson says. “It’s empty. Everybody’s gone.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Kieshaun White says that he doesn’t like to talk politics when it comes to the environment. He prefers to stick to the data.
A year ago, as a high school senior, he launched a network of air-pollution sensors and real-time app to monitor breathability around his native Fresno. White founded Healthy Fresno Air, using grant funds from the city’s Boys and Men of Color group, which was recently awarded $50,000 by former President Barack Obama’s My Brother’s Keeper initiative.
At first, he deployed a handful of monitors at high schools on Fresno’s heavily polluted southwest side; since then, he has expanded the network to other quadrants of the city. This spring, he launched a public-facing app that shows real-time information gathered by the sensors about levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10—the fine particulate matter (PM) that blow off freeways and smokestacks and into mouths and noses.
Aides for McCarthy did not respond to CityLab’s requests for comment; nor did those of Nunes. Jim Costa, the Democratic congressman who represents most of the city of Fresno, has condemned the Trump administration’s move. McCarthy has stated that he believes that a single emissions standard would be better for the state. “When you set emissions numbers that people can’t reach, and you aren’t taking economics into play… we could have one emission for everyone, and everybody would be happy,” he said in a 2018 interview with the Public Policy Institute of California.
For White, the political volleying feels like a dismaying waste of time. To him, the stakes are higher than Fresno’s bad air: White also organized Fresno’s local climate strike, leading youth marchers through downtown streets to call on leaders to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet. They chanted lines that he came up with: We walk as one, we breathe as one, we’re not going to stop ‘til the work is done. In an upcoming march, White plans to brandish signs asking Costa to pledge support for the Green New Deal.
After all, election results don’t always fully represent what people need or want. The San Joaquin Valley has some of the lowest voter turnout in the state. In White’s neighborhood, people feel disempowered, he said. He hopes his work will change that. Right now, he’s working with city officials to install an air quality monitor in each of the 115 square miles that make up Fresno, which will make his platform more accurate and useful. And he’s building a database that anyone can use to find air quality information. “We want to give this data to the community and let them press it to decision-makers,” White said.
And now that he’s 19, White intends to vote for leaders who care about the planet—and encourage his neighbors to do the same. “People in the southwest area of Fresno think their voices don’t matter,” he said. “But if we vote en masse, it’ll show a difference.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Included in text messages turned over to House investigators on Thursday are exchanges between Sondland and fellow American diplomats suggesting Sondland knew there was a quid pro quo being proposed—and that he wasn’t comfortable with it. The Washington Post reported Saturday that Sondland will be testifying on Tuesday as part of the impeachment inquiry in the House.
Initially, when another diplomat said to him over text that “it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” Sondland responded by denying a quid pro quo, but then added that the conversation should not continue over text. On Friday, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson (Wisc.) told the Wall Street Journal that Sondland had told him in late August that the Trump administration’s offer of aid to Ukraine was tied to the country’s willingness to try and dig up dirt on Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who had previously worked for a Ukrainian company. Johnson told the Journal that he brought the issue up with Trump, who denied a quid pro quo. Sondland also travelled to Ukraine and met with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, the same day Trump had his now infamous call with the Ukrainian leader.
How did Sondland, who is not a career diplomat but was appointed to his post in 2018 by President Trump, wind up in the middle of this delicate situation? Not by spending years developing expertise in the region. Instead, Sondland’s experience is something much closer to Trump’s—developing hotels.
Prior to his appointment as a top Trump ambassador, Sondland, a 62-year-old native of Seattle, spent decades operating, and then owning and building high-end luxury hotels in the Pacific Northwest, mostly around Portland, Oregon, but as far as New Orleans. Unlike the president gold-plated excess, Sondland’s hotels are not branded with his name, but instead with a particularly cosmopolitan, quiet, and trendy style. Sondland appeared in industry publications as a hospitality industry executive in the early 1980s, but his big break was in 1998, when he and a partner purchased four older hotels in Seattle, Portland and Denver, and redeveloped them. Where Trump likes to slap his name on flashy new towers in exotic locations around the globe, Sondland has specialized in rebuilding classic American hotels.
Along the way, he developed a reputation as a prominent local businessman who dabbled in moderate Republican politics, occasionally partnering with Democrats and attempting to convince Hollywood producers to film in Oregon. According to his personal financial disclosure filed when he was nominated for his ambassadorial position, he served on the boards of several charitable organizations and Duke University’s business school advisory board. His net worth is listed as well north of $60 million, and he disclosed owning a Lear jet. In a video introducing himself to his new co-workers at the State Department, Sondland explained that he flies planes as a hobby, as he is shown climbing into the cockpit of a jet.

Real estate, luxury hotels, and planes would seem to make him a perfect match for the president, but he also was known for more refined taste—he has a large art collection, for instance, which he values as being worth as much as $25 million.
His role now is as the ambassador to the European Union, based in Brussels and tasked with representing America when it comes to Europe’s broader issues. His predecessor, Obama-appointee Anthony Gardner, came to the job from the world of private equity, but he had a degree in international relations from Harvard, speaks French, Spanish and Italian and had previously served in diplomatic roles. Sondland, however, got his diplomatic job the old fashioned way—by making large political donations. According to OpenSecrets.org,  Sondland has given at least $446,000 to federal candidates in the last few decades. Almost all the recipients were Republicans, but of the more moderate type—Jeb Bush’s Right to Rise PAC, for instance.
As the 2016 election ramped up and Jeb Bush was eclipsed by Trump, Sondland quickly aligned himself with nominee. The relationship hit a hiccup, however, when Trump denigrated Gold Star mothers at the Republican convention in 2016, Sondland and his business partner very publicly insisted that their names be taken off the invitations as hosts of a Trump fundraiser.
Sondland is not listed as a donor to Trump’s campaign—though he did donate the maximum amount to the Republican National Committee before Trump was nominated. Nonetheless, the hotelier and Trump must have patched things up, because Sondland appears on a list of the 2016 Trump campaign’s bundlers—a fundraiser who taps a network of other deep-pocketed donors to support a candidate. And, perhaps most importantly, OpenSecrets reported, Sondland wound up donating $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee.
More details of how much Sondland knew, and perhaps why he was so concerned about there being a text record of the conversation, may emerge next week, during his deposition before the House impeachment inquiry.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Travel is terrible for the environment, particularly if it is by plane. It’s such “a major contributor to ecocide,” that it had one travel writer vowing in The Atlantic to “cherish my own home turf more.” As concern about climate change reaches a fever pitch (finally), we’re finally realizing we might need to balance seeing the world with preserving it. What does this mean if you are a company whose very existence depends on users being tempted around the globe by … a lakeside one-bedroom in Italy, a cabana in Colombia, a yurt in France? All are vacation rentals that Airbnb served up to me when I recently browsed the home page—which also included a large banner advertising “the Antarctic Sabbatical.”
Welcome to Airbnb’s glitzy, greenwashing PR stunt: In December, the vacation rental platform will send five lucky volunteer “citizen scientists” to the desolate continent for 10 days. There, according to an online brochure featuring animations of chilly remote landscapes, they’ll explore an icefall, ride fat bikes with wide tires to grip the frozen terrain, and collect samples of snow. It’s these snow samples that are ostensibly the point of this scientific journey: They will be later analyzed, with help from real scientists, for signs of microplastics. Airbnb doesn’t list the price tag of the trip, which it is footing, but for reference a seven-day trip organized by Antarctic Logistics and Expeditions, the tour company Airbnb is working with costs $26,000 a person. After the trip, the volunteers will “work with Ocean Conservancy to become ambassadors for protecting the oceans, sharing with the world how others can help minimize their collective plastic footprint and act as stewards to our planet.” Conveniently, the volunteers will also be de facto ambassadors for Airbnb, as Caroline Haskins pointed out in Vice, as well as ALE (which advertises the trip on their site), and the entire concept of trekking to far-flung locales.
The Antarctic trip is the second trip in Airbnb’s “sabbatical” program; over the summer, the company sent five volunteers to “save the Italian village of Grottole” (i.e., drum up tourism interest and therefore economic growth). The line that Airbnb is telling reporters (Haskins, me) is that it hopes to show how travel can be a “positive catalyst for change.” Airbnb is not, as a spokeswoman emphasized to me, trying to expand its services into Antarctica, nor is it intending to encourage people to travel there, as was the case with the Grottole trip. The goal here, ostensibly, is science.
So, can this trip produce good science? Melanie Bergmann, a marine ecologist whose work charts how microscopic bits of plastic make their way through the atmosphere to faraway locations, wrote to me in an email that it’s difficult to say without knowing more about the particulars. It’s certainly possible for ordinary folk to help with collecting microplastic samples, as Airbnb intends participants to: Bergmann and her team had regular people living on a Norwegian archipelago pack up snow samples for a study themselves. The main challenge there was ensuring they did so in a way that wouldn’t further contaminate the snow; the lab provided pre-rinsed plastic containers.
Airbnb is partnering with a scientist for the trip: Kirstie Jones-Williams, a graduate student at the University of Exeter, is taking time off from her Ph.D. program to lead the trip along with Antarctic Logistics and Expeditions. They’ll be staying at Union Glacier Camp, ALE’s main hub for tourist trips. There will be two opportunities for data collection, Jones-Williams explained via email: one at the camp to understand its footprint, and again at various locations on the glacier, “places where we would not expect to find microplastics.” Though the trip includes several excursions to common tourist destinations like the Elephant’s Head and Charles Peak Windscoop, “This trip couldn’t be further from a tourist trip!” Jones-Williams wrote, noting that “the more our volunteers learn about this unique environment,” the more they will be motivated to tell people about what they learned on the trip.
It’s the same talking point of travel: “a positive catalyst for change”! I should point out that I was not allowed to email Jones-Williams directly. When I reached out to her, a PR person responded on her behalf. I sent her questions to send to Jones-Williams, and in turn, I received replies from Jones-Williams via the spokesperson. Jones-Williams plans to submit the results in a peer-reviewed paper—presumably with additional review by Airbnb and ALE—emphasizing that this is all typical of citizen science projects.
It’s not a typical citizen science project, which is often designed to widen the number of people (and their computers, binoculars, and other common tools) that can contribute to data collection and processing. They center around seeking out people who are already advantageously placed, as Bergmann did in asking folks who lived in Norway for snow samples, rather than hauling them across the ocean to put yet more footprints in a fragile ecosystem. Airbnb’s efforts are, instead, a company co-opting and twisting the notion of citizen science in order to use science (even perhaps a little real science!) to sell its mission and product. “The last thing that Antarctica needs right now is more people going down there,” says Jessica Green, who studies the politics of climate change at the University of Toronto. She sees tourism as one of the biggest threats to the continent. “Putting forth the idea that just anyone can go is not very helpful.”
Here are some alternate ideas of how Airbnb could straightforwardly support science: providing a research grant, sponsoring a scientist’s fare, even partnering with ALE to have folks already on tour in Antarctica do data collection. Or just asking scientists what they need and supplying that. “You need quite fancy technology to actually find the microplastics,” Bergmann explains. The hard work of analysis once you return to the lab “is the bottleneck, not getting the samples.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

That is, of course, ridiculous.
Trump’s request to Ukranian president Volodymyr Zelensky for a “favor” that would help him politically smacks of corruption. As Sen Mitt Romney (R-Utah) noted Friday, asking for an investigation of an electoral rival is pretty clearly aimed at political gain, not stamping out graft. And as Trump has continued to profit as president from US government and foreign spending at his properties, his critiques of corruption in other countries ring hollow.
Then there is Giuliani, whose recent record also makes him a poor champion for rooting out corruption in other countries. As Trump’s lawyer, Giuliani has helped Trump to engage in behavior that triggered the whistleblower complaint at the center of the impeachment inquiry by the House. And while working for Trump, Giuliani has also engaged in what might be described as anti-anticorruption efforts in several countries.
In Ukraine Giuliani sided with officials and businessman accused of corruption in a bid to smear former 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden. As Vice President, Biden joined an international chorus of critics who advocated firing Viktor Shokin, a state prosecutor, whose failure to pursue corruption cases was considered to be, in itself, deeply corrupt. Giuliani argued, without evidence, that Biden wanted to protect his son Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of Ukrainian gas company.
Giuliani has also disparaged anti-corruption activists there since last year, arguing Ukrainians who helped to expose secret cash payments by Ukrainian politicians to Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort improperly interfered in US politics. His reasoning is that they interfered in US elections because Manafort’s exposure in August 2016 harmed Trump’s campaign.
His anti-anti-corruption portfolio extends to Romania. In August 2018, while working as Trump’s lawyer, Giuliani, seemingly out of the blue, wrote a letter to Romania’s president, Klaus Iohannis faulting the country’s National Anticorruption Directorate for alleged excesses in its prosecution. Giuliani said the anti-corruption effort had included “intimidation of judges; defense lawyers and witnesses; unconstitutional phone tapping; forced confessions; and unfair judicial processes.” Romania should give amnesty to officials convicted “through the excesses” of Romanian prosecutors, he wrote.
This missive contradicted official US policy. The State Department had encouraged the crackdown on corruption and reacted to the letter by declaring: “Rudy Giuliani does not speak for the US government on foreign policy.”
What led to Giuliani”s concern about Romanian prosecutors’ alleged excesses? Giuliani says he acted at the behest of Freeh Group International Solutions. This company run by President Bill Clinton’s FBI director Louis Freeh represented at least one Romanian facing the prosecutors Giuliani attacked. Giuliani told Politico that Freeh paid him for the letter, but he refuses to  disclose the amount.
The letter was also useful to Liviu Dragnea, the leader of Romania’s ruling Social Democrats, at the time Romania’s most powerful politician who was then also fighting a June 2018 conviction abusing his office, one of an array of allegations of corruption or official misconduct against him. Dragnea capitalized on Giuliani’s proximity to Trump and pointed to letter as an expression of official American policy, declaring that it demonstrated that “trust in the Romanian justice system is seriously shaken when it comes to foreign partners.” This statement was part of an effort by Dragnea to discredit Romanian prosecutors, a campaign with notable similarities to attacks made by Trump and his allies those who attempted to investigate the president’s alleged wrongdoings. Dragnea was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison earlier this year.
Giuliani declined to say how much Freeh’s firm paid him for the letter or to comment substantively on it. “I’d bet on Louis Freeh anytime and he was right on this,” he wrote. Asked if he knew who Freeh’s clients in Romania were, he did not respond.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

“There’s been a congressional increase that harassed and abused State Department employees by contacting them directly and seeking to have them provide documents…that belong to the State Department,” Pompeo said in response to a question at a press conference during his visit to Greece as part of NATO meetings, according to AFP. “That’s harassment. And I’m never going to let that happen to my team.”
The comments come a day after Pompeo and the State Department missed a deadline to turn over Ukraine-related documents to several House committees, according to USA Today. An anonymous House committee official told the paper that even as Pompeo missed the deadline, “The State Department has contacted the Committees on this matter and we hope the Department will cooperate in full promptly.”
The State Department did not respond Saturday morning to questions about the failure to turn over documents related to a whistleblower complaint that triggered the impeachment proceedings. USA Today notes that the White House has signaled that it will not release any documents until the full House authorizes an impeachment inquiry by vote; it’s not clear if Pompeo’s approach is part of the White House’s strategy.
Earlier this week Pompeo tweeted a letter he’d sent to Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, in which he said he was “concerned” that the committee’s request “can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career Foreign Service Officers, whom the Committee is now targeting.” The letter said that State Department officials would not appear before any House committee without executive branch lawyers, and that the timelines set by House Democrats, both for documents and interviews, was too compressed. “Let me be clear,” Pompeo wrote in a subsequent tweet. “I will not tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals” of the State Department.
A few days after he sent that letter, former US envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker testified behind closed doors for more than eight hours, providing the committee with what Democrats say is evidence of a “shadow shakedown” by Trump and his private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, according to Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. House Democrats subsequently released text messages that they say show State Department officials working to pressure the Ukrainian government into announcing an investigation into Biden in exchange for a meeting with Trump. House Republicans have alleged that the texts released by the Democrats are incomplete and “cherry picked” in order to bolster a partisan agenda.
Meanwhile, Pompeo’s department is in the midst of investigating the email practices of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and as many as 130 current and former State Department officials, according to the Washington Post. The officials under review—which range from low-level to senior officials who had reported directly to Clinton—have been told that their emails have been re-categorized as “classified” years after they were originally sent. State Department officials told the Post that the investigation has been ongoing since the end of the Obama administration, but the paper noted indications that the review is politically motivated and that some State Department investigators “made it clear that they were pursuing the matter reluctantly, and under external pressure.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) Saturday morning, calling him a “pompous ‘ass’,” and saying that the senator is bad for Republicans.
After tweeting that “the so-called Whistleblower’s account of my perfect phone call is ‘way off’,” Trump aimed his twitter fusillade at Romney, a frequent critic of the president.



One reason for the president’s recent assault on a man he once interviewed to be his Secretary of State is likely Romney’s tweet on Friday that described Trump’s “brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden” as being “wrong and appalling.”

The former GOP presidential nominee is among the very few Republicans to go after Trump on his use of American foreign policy to target a domestic political rival. He is joined by Sen. Ben Sasse, (R-Neb.) who on Thursday slammed the president for asking China to investigate the Biden family.
“Hold up: Americans don’t look to Chinese commies for the truth,” Sasse, who is not running for reelection, told the Omaha World-Herald on Thursday. “If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that’s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.”
Trump fired off the tweets en route to the Trump National golf course in Virginia, just outside of Washington, DC. They came after Trump spent Friday night into early Saturday morning tweeting attacks on Biden and clips from Fox News.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Some officials told Bloomberg that the reductions were part of an effort to increase efficiency following the departure of former National Security Adviser John Bolton. This point was underscored in late September, days after Trump named Robert O’Brien—a lawyer, United Nations delegate under George W. Bush, and, most recently, a State Department hostage negotiator—to be his new national security adviser. But the scandal underlying the whistleblower complaint certainly isn’t bolstering attempts to protect the job security of those working there.
The NSC is a national security planing and coordinating group within the White House that has been staffed, in part, by officials detailed from other agencies such as the FBI or CIA. Once a prestigious career booster, under Trump “some of the brightest minds are turning down” NSC assignments, while “others are avoiding the place altogether,” according to NPR, which detailed some of the morale issues in mid-September in the wake of Trump’s ousting of Bolton after disagreements over how to handle North Korea and Iran.
Since then, the worsening situation has been further exacerbated by the fact that  one of the main allegations lodged in the whistleblower complaint is that the White House has been using a classified computer system designed for the most sensitive NSC information to stash politically-embarrassing or sensitive material the Trump administration doesn’t want others to see. Add to this, the speculation that the whistleblower, identified by the New York Times as a CIA analyst, may have been detailed to the White House as part of an NSC assignment.
Trump has attacked the whistleblower and has said the White House is working to “find out about” them. On Friday, he retweeted an unsubstantiated allegation that the whistleblower was “a registered Democrat & CIA analyst” detailed to NSC before the 2016 election “where he worked on the NSC’s Ukraine desk & met [with] anti-Trump Ukrainian officials before being sent packing by the Trump NSC & becoming disgruntled.”
Saturday morning, Politico reported that the episode has “injected new tension and uncertainty into the grueling day-to-day routine” at the NSC. According to the report, those who are most worried are the experts on the Ukraine and Europe. “One question people are asking is, ‘Are the implicated NSC people going to stay or kicked out?'” one NSC official told Politico. “I’m surprised these people are still here.”
The NSC has long been known as a tough place to work due to the intense pressure at any given time, but some have said things seem worse under Trump. Dan Shapiro, a former NSC official under President Obama, touched on the point Saturday:

It remains unclear how deeply the NSC will be dragged into the impeachment battles on Capitol Hill, as one of the texts released by House Democrats this week refers to at least one NSC official who may have been involved in trying to coordinate a call between Trump and the Ukrainian president as part of normal duties.
Javed Ali, the Towsley Policymaker in Residence and a visiting professor at the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy, and the former senior director for counter-terrorism at the National Security Council under the Trump administration, told Mother Jones that many of the issues now being raised have been concerns in the past. For example, there’s been a debate about the size of the NSC for many years under several administrations, as the office has grown far larger than originally conceived. Bloomberg pegged the NSC staff size at about 310, but in previous years it has been as high as 400, prompting concern from some that it had become more of an operational office than an organizational one.
Staffing and morale issues reported over recent weeks are also nothing new, as it has always been difficult to attract interest in these positions nearer the end of any administration’s term in office, or as a reelection campaign looms. Some people who had worked in Trump’s NSC and left, have returned, Ali says, suggesting that morale “can’t be that bad.”
However, the main role of NSC staff is to offer policy makers the best analysis and advice and not get involved in political matters. “The more the NSC gets dragged into these political, partisan debates,” he says, “the worse it is overall.” The ongoing issues with Ukraine and the whistleblower could be having some effect on those who work there. Trump has also been accused of overtly politicizing the NSC in unprecedented ways, such as when he elevated former chief political strategist Steve Bannon to the Principals Committee, or when the White House and a former NSC staffer teamed up with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) to bolster Trump’s claims that the Obama administration had spied on him. Trump is on his fourth national security adviser in less than three years, so time will tell how O’Brien manages the situation.
“The more you’re out of the limelight, the better things go organizationally,”Ali says, referring to the role of the National Security Adviser. “We’ll see how he does now that the NSC is dragged into this thing.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

To Nakaya They’re One and the Same,Sam Van Pykeren,MotherJones,Media,"Nakaya insists she isn’t a sad person. “I have my dark days,” says the LA-born and Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter, “but I’m a very social, outgoing person.”
Her music is another matter. Sadness suffuses her songs. Like anything from Sufjan Stevens, Mitski, or Phoebe Bridgers (to name a few), Nakaya’s songs engulf you in a moment of anguish, refusing to let you go until the track meets its end. In tracks like “Something More” and her latest, “Wither,” she treats the loss and loneliness that come in the aftermath of a relationship as a sort of death, rather than as passing mood.
“I write a lot of songs about loss, because it feels really distinct,” she says with a smile on her face. “It’s very visceral, and to take that physical experience and turn it into something that’s auditory is what makes music so special.” Music, she says, is “a beautiful way to explain an experience.”
I first heard Nakaya by chance, as a featured singer on Glassio’s “Daydream.” There was an eeriness to her voice that diverged from the usual electro-pop femme vocal feature. (You know the kind—anything Chainsmokers.) Nakaya’s voice stood out from the background without overwhelming it. In 2017, Nakaya had only a few tracks out, but in each she sounded like an artist who’d been around for years. Without the upbeat production of Glassio’s synth pop, Nakaya’s voice was left to its own splendid devices, delivering lyrics with a creepy accuracy of emotion.


Nakaya relies on a multitude of musical influences, which she traces back to her time growing up in LA with her Panamanian hip-hop–producer father. “He was a sample-based producer. Not only was he listening to other hip-hop music, but, like, random shit. Sometimes we would listen to Bulgarian women’s choir or Icelandic folk music, or just really oddball things,” she says. “I really do think because of my upbringing, my work is a very clear amalgamation of, like, a whole mess of things that in the end very much feel like me, but are a little less easy to define.”
Nakaya left LA for school in NYC, where she studied how to turn her experiences into an auditory experience. “I’m just a really emotional person who has all of these feelings all the time, and music is just an amazing way for me to get it out,” she says, voice rising. She recalls writing a song called “Dear Skin” when she was 18. “It was really personal,” she says. “I cried in class when they forced me to play it for critique. It was way too personal for me. I just felt like I was seen in this uncomfortable way. But being seen in that way now makes me feel very powerful. It takes away the shame of the things that I feel sometimes.”
Her latest, “Wither,” is likewise a work of personal reckoning. “I went through a really nasty breakup last year that wrecked me for a long time, and I didn’t think that I was going to be able to come back from that,” she explains. “I wrote ‘Wither’ about my ex and that literal feeling of knowing you just have to let it go. I have acceptance that this is not a thing in my life that serves me anymore.

“I am just so close to the people in my life. The loss of a relationship really feels like the end of a track, in a certain regard, in my life. Everyone has fucked something up and lost someone important in their lives. And that is a theme that feels very potent in stages of my life.”
Throughout our conversation Nakaya’s eyes never break from mine. She is serious about sadness, about the strength that can come from submitting to your emotions.
“There is something so freeing about being able to sit with the thoughts that feel really scary and let them happen and understand that they’re going to move and that they’re not always going to be there,” she says. “You can relinquish some of the power that it has over you.”

https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2019/10/homecoming-project-oakland/,2019-10-04,,,crime-justice,November/December 2019 Issue,A Radical Approach to Helping Former Prisoners Start Over: Let Them Into Your Home,Marisa Endicott,MotherJones,Housing,"When she first got out, little things like crossing the street were difficult for London Croudy. “When you’re in prison, the only thing you’re thinking about is going home. You plan all these things in your mind, and then all of a sudden you get out and reality hits you,” Croudy says. “They are like, ‘Go find a job and get this ID,’ and you’re like, ‘Oh my god, Uber—what the hell is that?’ I feel left behind sometimes.”
After serving eight years of a 13-year sentence for conspiracy to distribute heroin, Croudy was released to live in a halfway house in Oakland, California, run by the private prison company GEO Group. She had to share a room with several people, and the beds and food were similar to those in prison. She had an hour of rec time and a strict curfew. “Just pretty much a step over incarceration,” she says. “Still walking around with fear.”
That changed when she met Sabina Crocette, a lawyer who was working at a prisoner-rights nonprofit. They started hanging out, and when Croudy asked Crocette if she knew anyone with an extra room to rent, Crocette remembered a new pilot program she’d heard about: the Homecoming Project, which pays people with a spare room to house those returning to the community after long prison sentences. Crocette had previously taken in formerly incarcerated people with mixed results, but she’d connected with Croudy and wanted to try it again. About two months later, Croudy moved in.
Croudy tears up remembering the first time she saw her new bedroom in Crocette’s West Oakland townhouse. Croudy assumed she’d basically be sleeping on the floor, but after she saw the queen-size bed and dresser dotted with fake candles, “this peace just came over me,” she says.
Few formerly incarcerated people land in such welcoming accommodations, particularly in the Bay Area’s absurdly overpriced housing market. In Alameda County, where the Homecoming Project operates, 4,800 people returned from state prisons in 2014. About one-quarter of the county’s residents have a criminal history, and at least 20,000 people—disproportionately people of color—face housing insta­bility because of their records. So the Oakland-based nonprofit Impact Justice looked to Airbnb’s model and flipped it on its head as a way to offer affordable, stable short-term housing. Since Impact Justice started the Homecoming Project in August 2018, it has settled 12 formerly incarcerated people in private homes, rent-free.
“There’s hidden assets in our midst, and if we were able to pay the homeowner for housing someone coming home from prison, what would that look like?” says Terah Lawyer, Homecoming’s program manager. There’s “a level of desperation” among people leaving prisons, she says, because “housing is such a great need and one of the biggest fears of individuals coming home.” Applicants have told her that they’d be happy to sleep in a box in someone’s backyard. “They will settle for less because they think that they deserve less,” she says. “I always try to tell them, ‘You are worth way much more than a cardboard box.’”
Croudy and Crocette knew each other beforehand, but that isn’t typical of the program’s pairings. Would-be tenants go through an extensive screening and matching process, answering questionnaires covering their bedtimes, cooking habits, and pet peeves. Hosts are asked whether there are drugs, alcohol, or weapons in the house. Once a pair is matched, they meet and can reject the other for any reason. Ultimately, housemates sign a six-month agreement, and the host gets a monthly stipend of about $750. During that time, the Homecoming team works with tenants to find more permanent housing.
Beyond providing shelter for a vulnerable popula­tion, the project aims to remove the stigma surrounding incarceration. “How can the community heal the community?” asks Lawyer. “What sets it apart from traditional transitional housing programs is that the funding doesn’t go into some for-profit transition program. It goes into the community, stimulating the economy.”
Providing stable housing for former prisoners seems like a no-brainer: It reduces recidivism and prison populations, saving taxpayers money. Yet people getting out often have to hunt for space in shelters, sober living facilities, or halfway houses. Going it alone is virtually impossible for anyone with a criminal record, little money, and no credit or rental history. Finding decent housing is even harder for people who have finished long sentences. In part because they are less likely to reoffend, few programs serve them. Yet typically this group needs the most help, which is why the Homecoming Project primarily focuses on people who served 10 years or more.
Long-standing challenges to housing formerly incarcerated people have become more acute as California’s housing crisis deepens and criminal justice reforms chip away at decades of tough-on-crime policies. In California, statewide reforms reduced a quarter of the prison population between 2008 and 2018. At least 30,000 people are released from state prisons every year. The 2018 First Step Act has also led to thousands of early releases from federal prisons. Formerly incarcerated people are almost 10 times more likely to be homeless than the rest of the public.
Lawyer knows these challenges firsthand. After serving 15 years in prison, she was placed in a residential treatment facility in San Francisco. She couldn’t visit her family. She had to attend 30 hours of treatment classes weekly for a substance abuse problem she didn’t have. “In fact, I’m a certified drug and alcohol counselor that is able to facilitate the same classes that I was subjected to take,” she says. Program restrictions also kept her from starting the job she had lined up before leaving prison.
She used her experience to shape the Homecoming Project, which tries to foster independence while offering participants and their hosts extensive support. For hosts, the program offers workshops on conflict resolution and what it’s like to be incarcerated. A “community navigator” acts as a case mana­ger and life coach. One participant, Jesse Vasquez, went to prison as a teenager and served 19 years for attempted murder. In his first two weeks out, his community navigator went with him to the DMV and the doctor’s office, and to get his birth certificate. “He would stand there in line with me, guide me through the process. He taught me how to navigate a cellphone, how to set up email,” Vasquez says. The community navigator also brought Vasquez to volunteer at a food pantry and introduced him to new neighbors. “He was essential in kind of helping me get my roots into the community.”
Adjusting to life on the outside, Vasquez says, “there’s a sense of an arrested development.” The first time he took a bath, he filled the water too high, and when he got in, it overflowed. His first time cooking in his new home, he set off the fire alarm and panicked that the cops or paramedics would show up. “The problem was that I was still thinking that I’m still 17. But here I am, I’m 36, and how do I interact in an adult world?”
While the Homecoming Project’s dozen placements are a small sample size, the results have been promising. All current and former program participants have jobs. Vasquez is pursuing a degree in child development and psychology while working with two nonprofits. Croudy works with a criminal justice group and is starting a multimedia platform to share the stories of formerly incarcerated women. Of the six people who have completed the program, three have gone on to live independently, while the others, including Croudy, have continued to live with their hosts under a separate lease agreement. Looking ahead, the Homecoming Project hopes it can help organizations outside the Bay Area replicate its model.
Eight months into living together, Croudy and Crocette have settled into a comfortable routine. Croudy no longer asks permission before making a move in the house, and Crocette doesn’t worry whether she should introduce Croudy as her “sis,” “new family member,” or just “housemate.” “London didn’t need a mother. She didn’t need a sister. She didn’t need a mentor. So just kind of learning the process of letting go a little bit,” Crocette says. “The intention was to make her feel welcome. At the same time though, it’s the balance of recognizing the person’s independence.” Sitting close to Crocette on the couch in their backyard, Croudy interjects, “The beauty of our two different walks in this same situation is that, in fact, I did need her. I did. [She] gave me the motivation and the confidence and the ease to be able to do these things.”
“She’s the one who sat me down,” Croudy adds, “and was like, ‘Hey, you don’t have to ask that. You’re a grown woman. Be you.’”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) says this system is in desperate need of reform—and in recent months has pushed to keep the issue a top priority for legislators.
On September 26, the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship held a hearing on the continued expansion and current state of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s detention system. Chaired by Jayapal, the hearing included testimonies from former detainees, advocates, and former ICE Director Thomas Homan. In February, Congress approved funding for ICE for about 45,000 beds per day in the hopes of reducing that number to 40,500 beds by October 1. NBC News reported that in August, the Department of Homeland Security transferred $169 million from other agencies, including FEMA and the Coast Guard, to ICE. Now, there are about 51,000 people in ICE detention. “It is a universally accepted fact that immigration detention is supposed to be a civil, non-punitive function,” Jayapal said in her opening statement, “However, the immigration detention system is a virtual replica of the criminal incarceration system.”
Jayapal has sponsored a House bill, the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, that would completely overhaul that system, including eliminating for-profit immigration detention. Though Jayapal’s bill would be ignored by a Republican-led Senate, it’s reflective of how progressive Democrats think about fixing an unjust punitive system.
In the wake of last week’s hearing, Jayapal spoke with Mother Jones about the bill and how she thinks the immigration process could be transformed. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
Give a quick summary of what your bill would do.
The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act would transform the detention system from its currently cruel and inhumane and costly system to one that is much more humane and cost-effective. It would transition all for-profit immigration prisons to government-run and funded detention centers over a period of three years. It would also eliminate mandatory detention. It would protect the rights of vulnerable populations, in particular, by introducing alternatives to detention for those who do not need to be in a jail, have never been charged, much less convicted of anything, and are simply waiting for their asylum papers to come through. It streamlines the whole detention process so that we are really only retaining people who really need to be in detention and we are not using it as a punitive incarceration system for 56,000 people every day.
What are some of those alternatives to detention?
There are a number of community-based programs that have been incredibly effective where you can release individuals into the community. You can provide them with legal resources and support so that they know what the processes and then they can come back into the system for this hearings. The woman who was testifying today from the Interfaith Community for Detained Immigrants talked about how they have 100 percent rate of people showing up for their hearings when they are in the alternatives to detention program because they get resources along with that, so that they really understand what they need to do and when they need to show up. So most of the programs are based in the community. They’re run by community-based nonprofits, and they are done in conjunction with government officials so that people are released, and then they come back to be processed through the system.
As far as detention centers, how should those be operating?
Right now, the vast majority of immigration jails—we call it detention because it sounds better but they’re actually immigration jails—are largely operated by for-profit prison companies, and that is CoreCivic and the GEO Group. They make hundreds of millions of dollars on detaining people who have committed no crime. We are actually using some county jails now to hold people as well. But the private prison contractors have very little incentive to lower their prices or to provide some of the basic standards that should be met within detention centers, which is why we have so many inspector general reports and other accounts, data around how badly the detention centers operate and some of the horrendous things like nooses, hanging, dirty moldy food, no medical care. These have all been documented by the [Homeland Security] inspector general, including by the inspector general’s office that has been serving under Trump. If we could eliminate a huge number of the people being held in detention, then the much, much smaller number of people in detention could be held in government facilities.
The bill also sets up a penalty system for facilities that are noncompliant with a certain set of standards. Why is it important to have these types of accountability measures?
Because even though we do have some standards, they are applied extremely inconsistently. Even when the attorney general says there are problems and writes a report, and says that a facility is not meeting the standards, nothing is done. That facility continues to get money; that facility continues to operate. And there’s really no enforcement of the requirements that we have. We also do need to strengthen those standards, and make sure that they’re being adhered to. I think all of that means that we’ve got to have accountability and enforcement. Those penalties are a way to say you don’t get to continue to operate if you don’t meet the standards and if you don’t meet the requirements that we’ve set out for detention center to operate.
ICE has rapidly expanded its detention network in the Deep South this year even though Congress directed it to detain fewer people. What do you want the House to do to prevent that from happening again?
Well, we should pass my Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act so that we transform the detention centers. We should end some of the programs that the administration started that have led to the surges and spikes in detention. We should institute alternatives to detention, including down at the border. But we have to end Remain in Mexico and the asylum ban and some of these other things that have caused, in part, the buildup of people along the southern border and therefore into our detention centers.
One of the things that’s also happening is this overload in immigration courts around the country and this backlog of cases. Do you have a plan for how to tackle that?
The reality is that most of the people that are being processed at the border through Trump’s cruel Remain in Mexico policy are essentially bumping everybody else that is in the immigration court. So as we’ve criminalized immigration and we’ve put more people who really should not be in that system in front of a judge, and we’ve taken away the prosecutorial discretion, what it’s meant is this giant backlog in the immigration courts, and no due process. People are essentially being tried in groups. I just came back from a court in Texas, in El Paso, observing what had happened. Five courts there have been taken over by Remain in Mexico individuals who now have to be processed. And because they don’t have attorneys, they are clogging up the courts. They don’t need to be processed in that way. They don’t need to be held and criminally prosecuted for seeking asylum. We should be processing them separately. There’s been a problem with backlogs of cases because we keep adding to the list of people that now are going through immigration proceedings in front of a judge. That doesn’t need to be the case.
What can be done to create legal pathways so that people don’t migrate through these unauthorized routes?
We’ve been working on comprehensive immigration reform for almost 20 years now. It’s just a travesty that we use the work and the labor and the services and the contributions of immigrants, but we don’t allow a way for our system to function effectively. So, you know, we need to legalize the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are living here in the country, many of them have been here for more than a decade. So first, we need to take care of that. And then we need to also ensure that the 4 million people or so that have been waiting in line to reunite with their families that they are processed. Once we’ve done that, then we can start and say, “Okay, what’s the system we want to have?” What we want to make sure we do is that we have a flow of workers in the industries that need workers, many of which are industries that are populated by women like home healthcare, but they don’t get prioritized the same way that industries populated by men do. So we need to make sure that we are dealing with the needs of the economy, that we have a future flow workers, that respects workers of all classes and recognizes the value of all workers. We need to make sure that we continue to have a robust family immigration system.
If we do all of that, then we would not have the enforcement problems we have. We could have sane, humane, and reasonable enforcement along our borders and in the interior with the ability to penalize employers who continue to break the law. But we’ve got to change the rules so that workers can work and can have benefits and rights on the job, even if they come here for a short period of time as workers. So the pillars are pretty clear. In addition to that, we have got to deal with the root causes of migration. And that is making sure that we’re investing in the development of countries that send a lot of immigrants, but also making sure that we have particular ways for regions like the Northern Triangle region right now that is experiencing tremendous violence to be able to process and send people to the United States, so that there is a place of refuge for people to come to. We have to continue to be that country that welcomes people from all over the world.
Do you think House Democrats are going to be willing to spend the political capital to make all this happen?
It is certainly something that I am deeply committed to. I know the Progressive Caucus, and the Hispanic Caucus, we have many members who feel we absolutely cannot give this administration a dollar more for this kind of enforcement. They’re already stealing it from other places, like our troops, just to build a vanity wall that hasn’t even been authorized by Congress. But they’re also spending over the amount that Congress authorized for detention right now. Every year they do this, we only authorize a certain amount, and then they end up spending more because they’re detaining more. They need to set a clear set of priorities. Whether or not we’re able to hold on to that is complicated because we have a Democratic House, a Republican Senate, and a cruel, cruel, lawless, Republican president, which makes it very difficult. We have 133 co-sponsors on my bill, and many of my colleagues understand the dire circumstances that immigrants in this country face today.
Of the current presidential candidates, whose immigration policies have you been impressed with?
Julián Castro has done a great job of kind of talking about some of the travesties of immigration. All of the progressive candidates—Sen. Warren and Sen. Sanders have both talked about the ways in which we need to transform our system and pass comprehensive reform. Sen. Harris and I have introduced a number of bills together, including around access to legal counsel. Sen. Booker actually has cosponsored my Dignity for Detained Immigrants bill in the Senate. We have a number of champions on this issue. It’s starting to take more and more prominence and people are starting to understand in spite of the language, the rhetoric that is so divisive and that really criminalizes immigrants. In spite of that rhetoric that’s coming from the White House and the administration, the reality is the vast majority of people in the United States understand what our values are. They understand that immigrants contribute to this country, that we wouldn’t be here without immigrants from all over the world.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Food","Cloverleaf Farm, a small produce operation in Davis, California, managed to do okay during the extreme drought that lasted from 2012 to 2016. But in the first wet year after the long dry period, the farm lost its entire apricot crop to disease—$40,000 to $50,000 down the drain.
Researchers predict that as climate change worsens, there will be more frequent shifts between extreme dry spells and floods. As Cloverleaf learned the hard way, the phenomenon is already taking a toll on growers in the country’s largest food producing state. During the drought, California’s agricultural and related industries lost $2.7 billion in one year alone. Big cash crops like almonds and grapes are at particular risk in the future, unnerving farmers and vintners already taking hits from erratic and extreme weather.
Katie Fyhrie, a grower at Cloverleaf Farm, worries that the farm won’t be able to keep producing stone fruits—which depend on the timing and duration of winter chill—in the long-term. “It can be confusing to figure out how to move forward,” Fyhrie says. “Where we’re at right now, versus where we’re going to be 10, 20, 30 years down the line. It’s a really tricky thing to balance.”
Learn more about how climate change is transforming dinner—and how farmers are fighting back—on the latest episode of Bite:

Ancient plant species might hold important clues about which crops will survive in a harsher climate. With that in mind, Fyhrie and her team have started growing elderberries. An indigo pearl-sized fruit that grows on a big bushy plant, the elderberry is relatively unknown in the United States; the majority of the commercial market comes from an imported European variety. But Native American communities have been using a Western elderberry subspecies for centuries.
The elderberry that’s native to California grows remarkably well in drought conditions. After a couple of years, you can completely remove irrigation and the plant will keep producing. This last season, Cloverleaf harvested 130 pounds of berries from each of its most mature trees, none of which are irrigated. “That is a huge deal that we’re getting berries that are good for you, really versatile for a lot of products, and that require no additional fertilizer or water,” Fyhrie says.
Elderberries are just one of “many hardy ancient foods and crops that may be a poised to make a twenty-first century comeback,” as Amanda Little puts it in her recent book The Fate of Food: What We’ll Eat in a Bigger, Hotter, Smarter World. Global warming is “forcing us to think differently about the quality and resilience of the crops we grow—both in the poorest parts of the world and the wealthiest,” she writes. Some researchers are trying to breed almonds, apples, and avocados that are more resistant to hot weather and drier saltier land. General Mills is now using Kernza—derived from ancient perennial wheatgrass native to the Kansas plains—in some of its cereals, snack bars, and crackers. In comparison to traditional wheat, Kernza is much more sustainable and better at sequestering carbon.
With support from a sustainability grant from the California Department of Food and Agriculture awarded in fall of 2018 and in partnership with the University of California–Davis, Cloverleaf is running field trials with elderberries, developing best practices guides for growers, and doing nutritional and market analyses. The idea is to explore boosting grower adoption and consumer interest in the berry.
At Cloverleaf, Fyhrie uses the fruit in syrup, jelly, and even fruit leathers and an elderflower cordial. Dried elderberries can be used for tea and baked goods. They’re also used in food coloring and dyes. Because of the berries’ antioxidant and antiviral properties (in certain subspecies at least), they’re popular in the health food community and are commonly used as supplements or to treat colds and flu.
While not all native plants are going to fare well under climate change, many have survived millennia in their changing environments, adapting along the way. “There is so much food that grows everywhere without anybody really doing much at all. And here we are cover cropping, spreading compost, tilling, putting on plastic mulch, irrigating daily, weeding, constantly dealing with crop losses from pests,” Fyhrie says. “Everything that we’re growing for our profit is so high intensity in terms of labor and resources, and then we’re surrounded on all sides by these plants that are just producing and producing. It just didn’t compute that we would only be growing these really resource intensive crops and basically ignoring all the resources that just exist on this land.”
Elderberries won’t replace apricots any time soon. Developing ancient and native crops or breeding new ones comes with a host of complications and long lead times. Processing elderberries requires a lot of labor, and they can be hard to digest. Kernza grains are less than a quarter the size of standard wheat grains, making harvesting difficult and costly, as Little points out, and recent crop failures limited General Mills’ Kernza rollout. Plus, changing consumers’ tastes is no easy feat.
But, there’s potential. When I stopped by the Davis Food Co-op on my way home from Cloverleaf, the woman at the wellness counter told me elderberries haven’t reached CBD status, but she’s definitely noticed an uptick in products lining the shelves. At first, Kernza was only used in boutique west coast breweries and bakeries; now it’s being adopted by one the country’s largest multinational corporations. So to Fyhrie, exploring new options like elderberries feels worth the squeeze.
She thinks it’s important to start to “really think about what type of plants can we get away with not watering, can we get away with putting less fertilizer, can deal with the heat, don’t need as much chill in the winter,” she says. “The more that we start to incorporate those now—while we have the water to establish them—the more resilient small farms will be in the future.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In a tweet, Trump Jr. claimed the situation created the “appearance of impropriety” and represented a clear “conflict of interest.” Given that his father is the most conflict-riddled commander in chief in American history and the Trump family has profited in various ways through the presidency, Trump Jr.’s comments bordered on self-parody. But he did make a valid point: When the relatives of prominent political figures engage in overseas business dealings or receive payments or benefits from foreign individuals or entities, ethical issues often arise. Trump Jr., his siblings, and his brother-in-law, Jared Kushner, know this well—at least they should, considering the questions that have been raised about their families’ foreign entanglements.

The Trumps’ sudden outrage about conflicts of interest and corruption rings somewhat hollow. That is because, before Trump took office, his company cut deals in some of the most corrupt corners of the globe. In one case, the Trump Organization—in a venture in which Ivanka Trump took a lead role—entered into a hotel development deal in Azerbaijan, which ranks 152nd out of 180 on Transparency International’s index of the world’s most corrupt countries. The Trumps’ partner in that project? The son of the country’s then-transportation minister, Ziya Mammadov— an official once described in a US diplomatic cable as “notoriously corrupt, even for Azerbaijan.” In 2017, the New Yorker reported that the Mammadov family were linked to a corrupt scheme involving operatives from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
In Brazil, Trump joined forces with Paulo Figueiredo Filho, the grandson of a former Brazilian dictator, on a proposed hotel project. The deal came undone shortly after Trump’s election, when Brazilian prosecutors began investigating Figueiredo. He was arrested in Florida earlier this year and is awaiting extradition to Brazil for his alleged role in a scheme to divert pension funds into real estate developments—including the planned Trump hotel and tower in Rio de Janeiro.
If Donald Trump Jr. is really concerned about the appearance of impropriety, he could start by looking at the operations of his own family business, including the Trump International Hotel in DC. Not only is the hotel housed in a government building (conflict!), placing the government in the awkward position of being a landlord to the nation’s chief executive, but it has become a magnet for foreign officials (conflict!) and others seeking to curry favor in Washington.
The ongoing overseas business dealings of the Trumps pose another set of conflict-of-interest concerns. Before taking office, Trump pledged his company would engage in no new business deals abroad, but this ban on doing international business didn’t apply to projects that were already in various stages of development. Each of the Trump Organization’s foreign relationships carries its own ethical baggage, because foreign governments can attempt to use these ventures to influence the president.
Setting the stage for his conflicted presidency, Trump feted a handful of his foreign partners at his inauguration. Among those who attended was billionaire Hussain Sajwani, the chair of Emirati real estate company DAMAC, which licensed the Trump name for two luxury golf course developments in Dubai. Donald Jr. and brother Eric jetted to Dubai for the opening of one of the clubs shortly after their father took office, then vacationed with the Sajwanis in the Maldives. Sajwani is close to Dubai’s royal family—Dubai’s crown prince attended the wedding of Sajwani’s daughter last year, as did Donald Jr. and Eric Trump.

The Sajwanis have not hidden their interest in developing a close financial relationship with the Trumps, especially after Trump emerged as a powerful American political figure. At a press conference in early 2017, Trump bragged that Sajwani had recently pitched him on a new multibillion-dollar development (which he turned down). On Inauguration Day, Sajwani’s son posted on Instagram about how lucrative the administration would be for his family.
Also on hand for Trump’s inaugural was Indonesian media magnate Hary Tanoesoedibjo, with whom Trump inked a deal in 2015 to build two resorts in that country. Tanoesoedibjo, who has been likened to the Trump of Indonesia, has dived into that country’s complicated politics, funding an upstart political party and floating a bid for president himself—inspired, he said, by the path blazed by Trump. Foreign Policy described Tanoesoedibjo as “knee-deep in dirty politics” and dogged by accusations of tax evasion (which he has denied). In 2016, Tanoesoedibjo purportedly introduced Trump to Setya Novanto, who was at the time the speaker of the Indonesian parliament. Trump brought Novanto onstage at a political event—three months later, Novanto resigned from office after getting caught on tape asking for a $4 billion kickback from an Australian mining company. (Novanto has since been convicted in a separate corruption case.) Since Trump’s election, Tanoesoedibjo has bragged about his access to Trump and has hobnobbed with the Trump children on multiple occasions. This summer, Tanoesoedibjo purchased one of the Trump’s Los Angeles mansions, and in September he welcomed Donald Trump Jr. to Indonesia to help drum up publicity for the yet-t0-be-built resorts. While construction has yet to kick off, local media has reported that Chinese state-owned construction companies could be involved in the project, not a great look due to Trump’s ongoing trade war with the country.
Speaking of China, the country—not known for its friendliness to American brands claiming intellectual property rights—has granted Ivanka Trump 34 trademarks since her father took office. At least three were approved the same day she dined, in her capacity as a presidential aide, with Chinese president Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago in March 2017. Another batch of trademarks were granted in the days before and after President Trump publicly announced he would take steps to keep Chinese cellphone manufacturer ZTE afloat. Were these trademarks approved on their merits or as part of an effort to influence Trump administration policy? That’s the pesky thing about conflicts of interest—it’s difficult to know whether business arrangements are legitimate or an attempt at influence peddling. Ivanka’s in-laws, the Kushners, have been involved in their own questionable dealings in China, where Jared Kushner’s sister appeared to actively promote the family’s connection to Trump as she marketed an EB-5 investment program on behalf of Kushner Companies.
Donald Trump’s efforts to muddy a political rival with corruption allegations has already backfired, landing the president in the middle of a growing impeachment scandal. But the strategy—if this ham-handed effort at political dirt digging could be called that—also seems likely to lead to uncomfortable questions about the Trump clan’s own business dealings.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice of environmental violation to San Francisco after President Donald Trump claimed that the city’s large homeless population was causing water pollution.
Addressed to Harlan Kelly Jr., the general manager of San Francisco’s Public Utilities Commission, the letter alleges that discharges in San Francisco’s drainage system contained heavy metals and bacteria, which were subsequently polluting the ocean and nearby beaches. The letter further alleged that the city had failed to properly clean, inspect, and repair its wastewater treatment and sewer system.
“The failure to properly operate and maintain the city’s sewage collection and treatment facilities” have resulted in main and pump station failures “that have diverted substantial volumes of raw and partially-treated sewage to flow across beaches and into the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean,” the letter states. The EPA charged that “approximately one and a half billion gallons of combined sewage annually” had ended up in beaches and recreational areas, a point that the city’s leadership strenuously denies.
All of this began last month, when after visiting San Francisco, President Trump warned that the city was potentially in violation of the Federal Clean Water act. He claimed that the size of the homeless population resulted in needles and human waste being poured into the ocean.
“It’s a terrible situation that’s in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,” Trump said to reporters on Air Force One. “And we’re going to be giving San Francisco—they’re in total violation—we’re going to be giving them a notice very soon.”
San Francisco Mayor London Breed and other city officials vehemently denied that claim, arguing that the city has some of the most advanced filtration systems in the country. “In San Francisco we are focused on advancing solutions to meet the challenges on our streets,” she wrote in a statement, “not throwing off ridiculous assertions as we board an airplane to leave the state.”
The official notice on Wednesday came a week after EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom accusing the state of allowing human waste from homeless populations in San Francisco and Los Angeles to pollute water systems.
Kelly responded to Wheeler, saying, “All combined sewer overflows are subject to equivalent-to-primary treatment before discharge. The frequency and volume of combined sewer overflows is consistent with the expected performance of the city’s combined sewer system and has been specifically authorized—for decades—by permits either issued jointly by EPA and California or by permits that have received EPA’s concurrence.”
San Francisco’s mayor London Breed also issued a response. “I’m sick of this president taking swipes at our city for no reason other than politics,” NPR reported she said. “As I’ve said before, there are no needles washing out to the Bay or ocean from our sewer system, and there is no relationship between homelessness and water quality in San Francisco.”
None of the claims made by Trump’s EPA connecting the city’s homelessness crisis to water pollution have been supported by city officials, who say that catch basins—grates on top of drainage pipes—trap debris such as needles coming out of storm drains, and that pollutants are subsequently processed in one of two treatment facilities located in the city. No specific repercussions were laid out in relation to this violation notice, but the EPA warned San Francisco that it could be hit with fines and penalties related to the Clean Water Act.
Trump’s fight over water pollution in San Francisco is part of a general attack on California, which includes the administration’s recent revocation of the state’s ability to set stricter automobile fuel admission standards than the national standard.
“We welcome EPA’s sudden interest in enforcing the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, which has been conspicuously absent since President Trump took office,” said Eric Schaeffer, former Director of Civil Enforcement at EPA and current Executive Director of the Environmental Integrity Project said in a statement. “But a regulatory agency’s enforcement authority is not supposed to be used as a political weapon, which is obviously happening here. It makes no sense to decide that homeless encampments are a major priority for Clean Water Act enforcement, when EPA has done so little to enforce illegal discharges from much larger sources across the US.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

These came after Rudy Giuliani had already spent months trying to get the Ukrainians to open an investigation into Hunter and Joe Biden.
The following text was sent just before the now-infamous July 25 phone call between Trump and the new Ukrainian president, but after Trump had put a hold on Ukrainian military assistance and told his aides to lie to Congress about why he did it:
Volker is clearly saying that a visit to the White House is contingent on Ukraine opening an investigation—and convincing Trump that the investigation will really happen. After the phone call, Volker and Gordon Sondland are dispatched to help the Ukrainians “navigate” Trump’s demands. Two weeks later, we get this:
President Trump “really wants” the investigation opened. Does the president of Ukraine know this? “Yep.”
Sondland goes on to suggest that they draft a statement for the president of Ukraine to deliver, thus publicly committing him to an investigation of the Bidens. A week later Sondland asks if they still want an “unequivocal statement” drafted and Volker says yes. A couple of weeks after that Ambassador Taylor asks about the plans for a White House visit:
Note that Taylor is a career diplomat. Sondland is a political appointee and a Trump loyalist. He obviously thinks it’s unwise to discuss this via text message.
Taylor and Sondland have their phone call, but obviously Taylor is still under the impression that military assistance is being directly held hostage to investigating the Bidens:
Sondland the loyalist dutifully says no, no, no; it’s not a quid pro quo. Nevertheless, he continues to think it unwise to discuss the details of what it is via text.
The upshot of all this is that it’s crystal clear to everyone that Trump is truly obsessed with getting Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Both a White House visit and military assistance are being held hostage to this. Volker knows it and Taylor knows it, while Sondland plays the loyalist role of explaining what the pretext is supposed to be: that all Trump wants is a commitment to running a clean government.
Adding all this to the transcript of the July 25 phone call makes it obvious to anyone over the age of five what’s going on. But will it matter? Both the White House and conservative media have already taken the position that, sure, Trump extorted Ukraine to investigate a political opponent, but the Bidens totally deserved it because they’re so corrupt. No way is there anything impeachable about that.
So far, Republicans in Congress remain unmoved, text messages or no. Tick tock.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The move comes as President Donald Trump and his allies have privately and publicly pushed for Ukraine to probe Joe Biden and his son, an effort now at the center of impeachment proceedings. The prosecutor’s decision raises questions about whether Ukraine is caving to pressure from the Trump administration to embark on a politically motivated probe of Trump’s top Democratic rival.
To date, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the Biden’s in Ukraine. Nevertheless, the president’s false corruption claims have since been widely parrotted and amplified, including by sites known to disseminate Russian disinformation.

The prosecutor’s announcement comes less than 12 hours after a trio of House committees released a trove of text messages that appear to show Trump officials dangling desperately needed military aid to Ukraine in exchange investigations that could boost Trump’s reelection. Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, provided House Democrats with the damning texts during his deposition before Congress on Thursday.

Gee, a Louisiana case that could greatly restrict abortion access across the country and overturn a previous ruling on the issue.
The case concerns a 2014 Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their facility. If this sounds familiar, it’s because the law is nearly identical to a Texas statute that also required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. The Texas law was ultimately deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2016. Despite that precedent, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decided to uphold the Louisiana law in the face of a challenge by abortion providers, and in February, the Supreme Court agreed to temporarily block Louisiana’s law pending a final decision.
As Mother Jones reported in March after the Supreme Court first made temporarily halted the Louisiana law:
Attorneys for the abortion providers who would be affected argue that the precedent established by the earlier Texas case is clear and that the Louisiana law is therefore obviously unconstitutional. But one major difference between the 2016 decision and the current case is the composition of the court. Since 2016, President Donald Trump has appointed two conservative Justices—Brett Kavanaugh, and Justice Neil Gorsuch—who are both believed to be hostile to abortion rights. In February, Kavanaugh dissented from the majority decision to temporarily stay the law until the court could make a final decision on the merits.
TJ Tu, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, who is representing one of the abortion clinics and two physicians impacted by the case, is hopeful that despite the new justices, the Supreme Court will uphold the 2016 precedent.
“Our view is that the makeup of the court should not alter the requirements of the constitution,” says Tu. “Because our case is so clearly controlled by an existing precedent, we’re confident that all of the Justices and certainly a majority could easily reach a decision in our favor.”
If the majority of justices decide to uphold the Louisiana law, they could do so in one of two ways. “If the court ruled…that Whole Women’s Health [the 2016 case] is still good law but is applied [differently] from state to state…that’s a setback for abortion rights, but it may not to be a devastating one,” explains Stephen Wermiel a professor of constitutional law at American University. But, he adds, “if the court overruled Whole Women’s Health, that would be devastating.”
Although a lot of attention has been paid to the rash of bills earlier this year banning abortion in states like Alabama, Louisiana, and Missouri, Tu argues that restrictive laws like admitting privilege requirements can do just as much, if not more, damage.
“The public imagination is so captured by all of the abortion bans that have been enacted, but it is cases like ours that are a much greater threat to abortion access,” says Tu. “In states like Louisiana, they are going to effectively make abortion completely out of reach before the Supreme Court ever has the chance to take up the question of Roe v. Wade.”
For conservative justices who might be unsure whether or not they want to overturn Roe, going after Whole Women’s Health could be an easy way to erode abortion rights, argues Wermiel.
“If you believe Roe and Casey [a 1992 case reaffirming abortion rights] were wrong and that the Constitution doesn’t protect the right to abortion, but you’re not sure whether you…are prepared to go that far,” he says, “this an easy first step.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The headline unemployment rate dropped to 3.5 percent, the lowest rate in half a century.
The numbers below the surface were decent too. Employment was up, unemployment was down, and only a small number of people dropped out of the labor force—probably accounted for by older folks retiring. The labor participation rate stayed steady.
At the same time, as you can see, the trend line recently has been steadily downward for the past year or so. If this continues at its current rate, we’ll hit zero net job growth in the first quarter of 2020.

The company released a statement saying that four consumer Microsoft email accounts had been compromised by a group its calling “Phosphorous,” but that those accounts did not belong to anyone associated with a presidential campaign or the government. The attackers were first observed making more than 2,700 attempts to identify specific Microsoft accounts over a 30-day period beginning in August, Microsoft said, and then targeted 241 specific accounts with phishing emails, fake LinkedIn accounts, and password-reset requests.
“While the attacks we’re disclosing today were not technically sophisticated, they attempted to use a significant amount of personal information both to identify the accounts belonging to their intended targets and in a few cases to attempt attacks,” wrote Tom Burt, a Microsoft vice president overseeing customer security. “This effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources.”
The Democratic National Committee also issued a warning to campaigns on Friday revealing that the committee had been contacted by Microsoft, suggesting they check system logs for a related IP address, and offering advice as to how to defend against such attacks.

I have a related but similar complaint about the widespread belief on the left that the quid pro quo doesn’t matter. All that matters is that Trump asked Ukraine for help investigating a political opponent. The fact that he offered something in return is neither here nor there.
Legally, that might be right. Politically, it’s dead wrong, and impeachment is a political process. It’s absolutely critical that Trump is shown to have withheld vital military aid to an ally unless they agreed to help Trump in his reelection campaign. And like AM, I agree it’s the military assistance that’s key. No one really cares about visits to the White House, which are widely viewed as political favors in the first place.
Obviously the news is coming down on us like a firehose these days, and there are lots of things to report. That’s fine. All of them are worth following up.

And it may be right: Research shows trees improve air and water quality, store carbon, and can even reduce stress. All these benefits don’t seem to be lost on Mayor Eric Garcetti, who in late April announced his version of a Green New Deal for the city. Among other measures, he mandated that every new city-owned building be all-electric, established a goal to phase out styrofoam, called for a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, and, crucially, tasked the city with the goal of planting a whopping 90,000 trees by the end of 2021. “With flames on our hillsides and floods in our streets,” Garcetti said in a press release at the time, “cities cannot wait another moment to confront the climate crisis with everything we’ve got.”
The ambitious tree-planting project falls under the purview of Rachel Malarich, the city’s forest officer—a job that was just created in August to “oversee the growth of Los Angeles’ urban forest” as part of Garcetti’s Green New Deal. An arborist with more than a decade of experience in urban forestry, Malarich was appointed just days before the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report that emphasized the role of trees and forests in combatting climate change. The project will grow what’s already the largest urban forest in the country, making what happens in Los Angeles an important model for other cities looking to go green.
A real tree nerd myself, I called Malarich last month, when she was just a few weeks into the job, to chat about the unnoticed benefits of urban foliage, which species is her favorite, and the challenges of actually planting tens of thousands of trees in just a few years. Below is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.
In my mind, your day-to-day looks something along the lines of Leslie Knope’s job from Parks and Rec. What kinds of things do you deal with now or do you expect to deal with?
I don’t think I’m down into a routine yet. In this initial time, I’m meeting key stakeholders, including heads of departments and council offices and kind of doing the rounds of doing introductions. I’m also doing some background research. But I don’t know yet, honestly [laughs]. I’m still finding out where to get paper and pens.
I’m trying to wrap my head around this goal of 90,000 new trees by 2021. It would require planting, on average, almost 100 trees per day [beginning in April 2019]. How is that going to be possible?
Well, now you’ve discovered the secret of what I’m doing with my time; I’m out there with a shovel—no I’m kidding [laughs]. The truth is, we don’t plant if at all possible between say, June and September. It’s too hot for people to plant, so that limits more the time in which we’re planting.
But the reason it’s totally feasible and I feel real confident is, it isn’t just the city who’s planting. There are more than five nonprofits that plant trees in Los Angeles and do fundraising and community organizing around that. And they work very, very closely with the city and with each other to plant trees. There’s definitely a portion of this goal that’s going to be me doing some very strategic planning and grant writing and engaging our community groups and partners to help us reach this aspirational goal. But it’s doable. We have the partnerships and expertise in place to do it.
Are there areas or neighborhoods that you plan to focus on?
Obviously, higher-need neighborhoods. We have areas around the Port of LA that have low canopy cover. We have portions of the San Fernando Valley which are extremely hot and could use some additional shade. And portions of South and East LA that also have tremendous opportunity to get additional canopy and are under different environmental and social burdens.
Are there some benefits of urban trees that you think most people don’t realize?
Trees help us capture stormwater. They slow down rain when it falls from the sky, which is a huge deal here in Los Angeles, with our storm events, to be able to capture some of that water. [Water] droplets collect on the leaves and then run down the branches and have time to soak into the ground rather than just hitting the pavement and rolling away.
Another one that I don’t think people always think about is the transpiration that trees provide. They provide cooling overnight by releasing moisture through the transpiration process. That is something else that continues to amaze me. I remember I was in Washington, DC, on a trip and walked through a city street and then walked through part of the National Mall that had tree cover. And it was so dramatically cooler. And it was nighttime, so it wasn’t that there was shade covering me. It’s again, those living things that are cooling the area.
They also bring communities together. The research shows us that they improve feelings of social cohesion in a neighborhood. And feelings of connectedness to our communities can also increase our resiliency in light of other disasters. I think that trees are a really important part of our communities, and they are hugely connected to public health.
Are there any challenges specific to Los Angeles that you’re dealing with?
I don’t know that this is necessarily unique to LA, but obviously, we have the issue of infrastructure conflicts. The trees that were planted 50 years ago that were too big, they weren’t the right tree for the right place, and they are now lifting the sidewalk. So at the same time, they are providing shade and benefits to those communities, while making them [Americans with Disabilities Act] inaccessible.
One thing that is kind of unique to the region is the invasive shot hole borer [a fungus-farming beetle] that appeared several years ago. Most pests attack one group of trees—like with Dutch Elm disease or the Emerald Ash borer. This invasive shot hole borer has lots of trees that it likes to eat. And it’s actually not the bug that’s killing the trees, but Fusarium, the fungi that they use to feed their offspring, that is, in fact, causing the tree to fail. That has been a huge issue for this area and one that has concerned a lot of arborists. And a lot of people don’t know about it. It can kill a tree within two years and there’s no cure at this point.
If you were to give one piece of advice to another person in your position, or a city hoping to hire someone in your position, what advice would you give them?
I don’t know if I have an answer for that. If I was a person of the public wondering why we need such a position, I don’t always think that arborists, our city foresters, get the respect they deserve having to deal with [pause]—in the forest, a tree can lose a limb, no problem, no one’s around to get hit. It’s the risk management side of urban forestry that makes the job challenging and really important. And people don’t always appreciate that.
Part of the reason that I’m having a hard time with this question is that the scope of LA’s urban forest is really unique in terms of the size—the city is huge. And it has a ton of different trees. And not a lot of climates can handle as much diversity as LA has. We can take species from all over the world and grow them here in a lot of cases, so it’s kind of hard to compare.
Is there a certain type of tree that you think that you think works particularly well in urban environments?
This is a question I’ve gotten actually from some staff in the past couple of days. The hard thing about trees [pause]—if I’m, let’s just say, working with street lights, I’m going and maybe replacing a bulb, right? When I’m looking at trees, it is a site-specific decision. So I’m standing in front of a property, I’m thinking, “Is there a tree on the property already that’s hanging over the sidewalk? Are there power lines? Is there grass or is it a dirt parkway? Is it concrete?” There are so many different factors that we consider and have to look at. “Is it going to do well in this area closer to the coast? Is it going to do well with the sandier alluvial soil in the Northeast Valley?” It not a simple decision.
In some areas, sure, there’s a tree that I think would be better at capturing particulate matter or providing a larger canopy, but it is not able to grow in as small a space as is available to me. So in some communities, what we have is four-by-six foot concrete cuts the trees can go in and that drops it down to maybe 10 species that I’m looking at planting. So for me, it’s the tree that’s going to be best for that location. Right tree, right place.
Do you have a personal favorite species of tree?
It really depends. Coast Live Oak is my current favorite. It’s one that’s native to California. If you drive up the coast, up the 101 freeway, is what you’re going to see in the pastures along the road. They support over 300 species of birds and insects. They’re just beautiful and they’re keystone components to our ecological systems.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

His response says, in order, that the House request is legal BS; it provides too little time to prepare; it denies opportunity for counsel; it asks for too many documents; and it’s nonsense to suggest that if they don’t appear it constitutes obstruction. It is nothing more than an attempt to “intimidate, bully, and treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State.”
So that will be the Fox News line on all of this. But what will be the Democratic reponse? Pompeo makes no bones that he will throw up every roadblock he possibly can: “I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attemps to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State.”
These things always end up in negotiations between the relevant staffs, and perhaps the request and Pompeo’s response are merely maximal opening bids. But I bet not.

The excerpt provides a revealing look at the internal drama within the White House as the Trump administration has aggressively cracked down on migration to the United States; White House advisers are described as being in a state of “near panic” after Trump ordered the closure of the US-Mexico border in March.
At the time, then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen reportedly warned in a March meeting that migrants would still try to claim asylum after crossing into the United States if Trump closed the border. In another exchange, Trump suggested the need for a cement wall, to which Nielsen reportedly responded: “I literally don’t think that’s even possible.” According to the report, the president “routinely berated Ms. Nielsen as ineffective and, worse—at least in his mind—not tough-looking enough.” Trump eventually ousted Nielsen as part of an overhaul inside his administration of other officials who White House aide Stephen Miller “believed were thwarting efforts to block immigrants.”
“The president was frustrated and I think he took that moment to hit the reset button,” former acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan told the Times.

On the first day of a Warren administration, the Massachusetts Democrat promises to sign an executive order mandating a $15-an-hour minimum wage for federal contractors. She intends to eventually extend that minimum wage to all workers—including tipped workers—through federal legislation.
The plan also calls for the passage of legislation that allows public sector workers, graduate students, gig-economy workers, farm workers, domestic workers, home care workers, and some managers to unionize. Like her fellow presidential frontrunners Biden and Sanders, Warren recommends repealing right-to-work laws (which gut union funding) and prohibiting companies from permanently replacing workers on strike. But she takes it a step further with promises to strengthen enforcement authority of the National Labor Relations Board and appoint “a demonstrated advocate for workers to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.”

“We cannot have a truly democratic society with so little power in the hands of working people,” Warren writes in the plan. “We cannot have sustained and inclusive economic growth without a stronger labor movement. That’s why returning power to working people will be the overarching goal of my presidency.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Max Rose (D-N.Y.) had some big news to announce at his town hall on Staten Island Wednesday evening: split-tolling on the Verrazzano bridge had reduced congestion and shifted costs onto out-of-state drivers; R trains were running more consistently in Bay Ridge; and he had beaten back a Port Authority proposal to eliminate discounts for residents using any of the three bridges off the island. Staffers handed out leaflets explaining his position on various commuter-related issues, and officials from the Metropolitan Transit Authority and the local chamber of commerce were on hand to answer questions.
But first, some housekeeping. As a few dozen reporters, a Republican opposition research tracker, and a hundred or so attendees looked on, Rose announced that after much deliberation he had decided to “fully support this impeachment inquiry” into President Donald Trump’s attempt to coerce the Ukrainian government into investigating Joe Biden.
Rose, who knocked off Republican Rep. Dan Donovan last fall in one of the year’s biggest upsets, had been one of the final holdouts in the Democratic caucus after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry last week. When a group of swing-district Democrats with national security backgrounds announced their support for an inquiry that week, Rose, an Army veteran, was not among them. Just a few weeks ago, he wrote an op-ed in the Staten Island Advance warning that a Trump impeachment would “tear our country further apart.”
But his comments on Wednesday were a reflection of just how quickly the ground on impeachment has shifted among Democrats of all stripes, and of how easy Trump has made it for cautious elected officials to get on board. As a representative from New York City’s most conservative borough, in a district Trump carried by 10 points, Rose has toed a moderate line in Washington and saved his rhetorical firepower for local issues. (This was the first of two town halls scheduled this week on commuting.)
But Trump’s alleged Ukrainian shakedown—and his subsequent, conspiracy-laden handling of the fallout—has made it possible for Rose to change his position without really budging from the safety of the middle-of-the-road. In his telling, it was less that Rose had come around on impeachment than impeachment had come around on Rose.
“If you look at the television, you just want to scream—if I had hair, I’d want to rip it out,” he said. He was stuck between Democratic colleagues who had prejudged the president before they’d even been sworn in and Republicans who have “suddenly…become deaf, mute, and blind whenever allegations against the president are brought up.” The White House, meanwhile, had “poured gasoline on the fire” at every opportunity.
But “the American people have a right to know if the president used his office to advance his self-interest,” and Trump, his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were getting in the way by ignoring subpoenas and threatening Congress. For an Army veteran, the idea that Trump could have played games with national security demanded answers. “That North Star of mine has always been those soldiers who are willing to risk it all,” he said. And if Trump provided adequate responses, he’d be the first to say so.
This is not, suffice it to say, the Rashida Tlaib line. But it’s not what the Max Rose line was in September, either. For a Congress member who prides himself on standing between two factions (“I will take on either my fellow Democrats or Republicans if they try to score cheap points,” he promised on Wednesday), it reflected where his idea of the most reasonable path now stood. Trump’s defiance of anything resembling oversight and accountability has made an impeachment inquiry a safe position for moderates.
As if to confirm this new reality, Rose’s announcement was met with minimal dissent. A sizable faction applauded his stance, while one attendee interjected in protest. “Did you support Christopher Steele, a British agent?” a man asked. He was shouted down.
All that out of the way, Rose returned to the matter at hand—the work of serving and surviving in one of the top-targeted districts in the country. He called for the Sackler family to be thrown in prison for fueling the opioid crisis, chided New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for rolling out a ferry plan that excluded Staten Island, delved into the minutiae of barges and pier construction, and respectfully disagreed with a man who said he’d prefer Medicare for All to his union’s own plan. The president’s name never came up again.
Afterward, I met Sharon Weerth and Bob Zuckerberg (“no relation to Mark”), two Democrats who had showed up to listen to their Congress member talk about commuter issues. They were relieved that Rose had finally come on board, but they acknowledged the political straits he was in.
“I’m glad he announced something, because up until now he was kind of on the fence,” Weerth said. “So now he came out and he said he was he was for impeachment—”
“An impeachment inquiry, that’s the difference,” Zuckerberg said.
“Right,” Weerth continued. “But still! Before he was like, ‘I’m not sure!’”
“He had to be very careful, and he still has to be very careful,” Zuckerberg said.
“Of course!”
But Rose, an ex-boxer, can still throw a punch when he wants. And right now, Trump makes a very easy target.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

So why is Trump blathering about this today? It’s not because China is going to investigate it. And it’s not because anyone outside of the fever swamp believes it. He’s doing it for a couple of reasons. First, he’s showing solidarity with the swamp. Second, he’s sending a signal that conservative media should be all over this.

And then there is the ally that Trump doesn’t like to talk about: Russia.
Russia helped elect Trump, and as he faces impeachment, Russian state media is standing behind him. Propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik, which target Americans with English language content, provide a clear view of Russian messaging on the Ukraine scandal and Trump’s impeachment. Together, they present a picture of a propaganda machine working to exonerate Trump, condemn former Vice President Joe Biden, and spread doubt about the trustworthiness of American government.
The particulars of the Ukraine scandal make a natural fit for the Kremlin’s playbook for destabilizing western democracies: sowing distrust of authority and turning corruption into a “both sides” problem, encouraging citizens to resign themselves to grift and propaganda. That Russian media has jumped on stories that paint the scandal as a deep state coup—a theory that Trump himself has dangerously expounded during the Mueller investigation—is predictable.
The dynamic was on display on Monday morning, after Trump falsely accused the intelligence community of changing its rules to allow whistleblower complaints to contain second-hand information.

RT picked this up and ran with it, running multiple segments that parroted Trump’s soon-debunked claim that this had occurred, and that it was evidence of a deep state operation against Trump. In one video shared on twitter, Ray McGovern, a former CIA analyst and RT regular who argues Russia’s 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee was an inside job, is quoted speaking conspiratorially about a group of “people who are behind all this,” as the segment emphasizes the narrative that the whistleblower’s complaint is untrustworthy because it involved second-hand information.

Russian media has also worked hard to portray Biden as the corrupt figure in the scandal. The president set off the whistleblower complaint by using his office to pressure the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to help him investigate Biden, a political rival. Trump’s claim—now repeated by Russian media—is that Biden withheld money from Ukraine in order to force the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor general who was investigating an energy company that his son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board of. The allegations have not been borne out by the facts: the prosecutor Biden helped push out was widely seen as corrupt and was not actively investigating the company. But with impeachment underway, the president has continued to argue that it is Biden who should be scrutinized—and Russian media is doing just that.
“While the transcript from Trump’s call does show that he asked Zelensky to look into the Bidens’ corruption as a favor, it does not show him using money as leverage or demanding anyone’s job in the same obvious way that his rival did just a few years ago,” RT correspondent Rachel Blevins stated last week on a show hosted by Scottie Nell Hughes, a former director of the Tea Party News Network and a former CNN contributor who has run multiple segments about Biden’s alleged corruption during her show on RT.
The Ukraine scandal is “such a perfect thing for them” according to Bret Schafer, who tracks Russian propaganda at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, an initiative of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. This is true not only because it fits into their destabilizing efforts, but because it also revives the narrative that Russian interference in 2016 was faked by Democrats and anti-Trump bureaucrats.
With events moving so quickly, Schafer believes that Russia is still developing a unique, and likely conspiratorial, narrative about the Ukraine allegations. “I’m waiting for them to find the angle to this that is different—that is really unique to the Russian perspective,” he says. One possibility already hinted at is the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that meddled in the 2016 elections.
Last week, RT focused on a piece of the scandal that has gotten comparatively little attention from US media: Trump’s request that Zelensky investigate CrowdStrike, an American cybersecurity firm that the Democratic National Committee hired in 2016 to determine if it had been hacked, ultimately uncovering two sophisticated Russian intrusions into the committee’s network. According to the White House’s call record of Trump’s conversation with Zelensky, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the company, suggesting without evidence that the DNC’s server may currently be in Ukraine. It’s not clear why the president might believe this, and the notion that any one server could be revelatory seems misguided: the DNC told a federal court this year that more than 140 of its servers had been affected. Conspiracists have baselessly alleged that CrowdStrike, which is headquartered in California, not only has meaningful links to powerful Ukrainians, but that it manufactured evidence of the DNC  hacks even though Trump’s own Department of Justice has affirmed in court that it has “independently verified” the company’s conclusions.
Trump’s CrowdStrike ask seems to be part of a larger effort among him and his allies (including Attorney General William Barr’s efforts to investigate the origins of the FBI’s Russia probe) to construct an alternate reality in which Russian interference in the US election was somehow a hit job pulled off by Democrats and the deep state.
“The Ukraine-CrowdStrike server angle seems like an avenue that has been less traveled that they can work a little bit harder to keep it in the bloodstream,” says Schafer. “I would not be surprised if we saw them go a bit more in on that in the coming weeks.”
“It’s not known right now if CrowdStrike’s server really is in Ukraine,” RT host Rick Sanchez said on his show last week. “The president seems to be saying so… But the president’s off-handed—maybe ‘calculated’—mention of this CrowdStrike issue, it could set off a new round of questions of whether Democrats were using a server on a foreign soil for their own political gain. As Yogi Berra would say, ‘curiouser and curiouser.’”
Sanchez was actually quoting Lewis Carroll’s Alice and Wonderland, but the network’s implication was clear: Russia’s 2016 hacking operation was really just make believe.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Why Not Both?,Kevin Drum,MotherJones,Commentary,"The Earned-Income Tax Credit is one of the largest social welfare programs run by the federal government. It’s available only to people who work—primarily those with children—and takes the form of a tax refund that generally amounts to a few thousand dollars each year.
Conventional wisdom has long held that the EITC motivates people to work, but a new study suggests this isn’t so. Dylan Matthews says today that this undermines conservative support for the program:
Let’s unpack this a bit. What it means is that the business community likes the EITC because they think it increases the size of the labor force. This in turn pushes wages down. In other words, part of the EITC is captured by corporations: they get to cut wages, which are are then made up by the EITC.
As you can imagine, this is a black mark against the EITC among liberals. Why should corporations end up getting a piece of a program meant to help the poor? If, instead, it turns out that the EITC has little impact on labor force participation, that’s a good thing. It means that the poor are getting 100 percent of the benefit.
Back in the days of old, this would probably be a net political negative: maintaining bipartisan support is a good thing even if it costs a bit in terms of help for the working poor. But these are not the olden days, and there hasn’t been bipartisan support for the EITC in ages. So I’d call this unalloyed good news if it’s true. It means the EITC’s benefits are going exactly where we want them, and we could even sever the connection to work if we wanted to. Republicans wouldn’t support this, but so what? They wouldn’t support it anyway.
In other semi-related news, the New York Fed recently completed a detailed study of minimum wage hikes in New York state. There have been loads of similar studies before, but most of them have focused on fairly small changes in the minimum wage, which still leaves us in the dark about the effect of larger changes. This study, however, tracks a minimum wage increase of nearly 50 percent over the course of six years by comparing border counties in New York (which saw an increase) with those in Pennsylvania (which didn’t). Here’s the result:
As the authors says, New York’s minimum wage increase “appears to have had a positive effect on average wages but no discernible effect on employment.”
This is tentatively good news for the $15 minimum wage campaign, since it suggests that even sizeable increases in the minimum wage don’t reduce employment. Keep in mind, however, that it’s still tentative for at least two reasons. First, it’s just one study. Second, it took place entirely during an economic expansion. The effect of a big minimum wage increase might be quite different during a recession.
Bottom line: it appears that both the EITC and the $15 minimum wage are pretty good programs for helping the working poor. What’s more, both have different pluses and minuses and they complement each other pretty well. Given what we know, progressives ought to support them both.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Good Luck if You Have Any Other Type of Insurance.,Abigail Weinberg,MotherJones,Politics,"In an apparent attempt to appeal to senior voters—and to divert attention away from the impeachment inquiry rocking the White House—President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that changes aspects of Medicare Advantage, the private-sector health plan that covers one third of the nation’s Medicare beneficiaries. During his speech, though, the president was far more occupied with attacking Democrats’ health care proposals than with delving into the specifics of what his executive order would do. The Trump administration touted the changes to Medicare Advantage as an alternative to Medicare for All, a universal health insurance plan supported by several Democratic presidential candidates.
“We’re delivering better, fairer, and more affordable health care for all Americans,” Trump said while announcing the executive order at the Villages, a senior living community in central Florida. Shortly before the event, the White House changed its name from “Protecting Medicare from Socialist Destruction” to “Protecting and Improving Medicare for our Nation’s Seniors,” the Tampa Bay Times reported. Instead of defending Medicare against “socialist destruction,” though, the executive order simply reduces Medicare Advantage premiums and allows it to cover more a broader range of services, such as adult day care and Telehealth, The Washington Post reported.
Despite his claims to the contrary, though, Trump has taken significant steps during his presidency to weaken health care in the United States. Trump claimed on Thursday that premiums for Obamacare were too high, but he himself has contributed to a rise in premiums. He has extended the duration of so-called “junk insurance” plans, which do offer lower premiums, but at the price of subpar care that doesn’t comply with the Affordable Care Act. And he has repeatedly attempted to implement work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries, which has left thousands of Americans in Arkansas and Kentucky uninsured. Last year, the uninsured rate increased from 7.9 percent to 8.5 percent of the population, the first time it had risen since Obamacare passed.
“We eliminated Obamacare’s horrible, horrible, very expensive and very unfair, individual mandate,” Trump said on Thursday. But by eliminating the individual mandate, Trump undermined the basis on which the Supreme Court upheld the ACA in 2012 and jeopardized the future of Obamacare. Republican state attorneys general are now arguing that without the individual mandate qualifying as a tax, the entire law is invalid. If the Supreme Court hears the case and overturns Obamacare, 19.9 million people could lose their insurance. How’s that for “better, fairer, and more affordable health care”?",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

You can read the whole report here, but I want to highlight just a single chart:
As you can see, Republican presidents tend to appoint fewer nonwhite judges than Democrats, which is perfectly understandable. Republicans want to appoint conservative judges, but nonwhite judges tend to be more liberal than average. There just aren’t a whole lot of conservative nonwhite judges for Republicans to choose from.
However, as you can also see, Republican presidents have nonetheless produced steadily higher numbers of nonwhite judges through the years—until you get to Donald Trump. Then, for the first time ever, the share of nonwhite judges is lower than the previous Republican president.
It’s tempting to roll your eyes at this and mutter “Duh!” under your breath. But not so fast. You see, one thing that pretty much everyone agrees about is that Trump himself plays no part in his administration’s judicial appointments. Not even a tiny one. The whole operation, until very recently, was run by Don McGahn using lists of candidates mostly prepared by the Federalist Society. And there’s no special reason to think that either McGahn or the Federalist Society share Trump’s racial views.
So why the sudden drop in nonwhite judicial appointees? It almost certainly has nothing to do with Trump, who probably couldn’t even name any of his nominees, let alone express opinions about them. Why have McGahn and the Federalist Society been so halfhearted about finding nonwhite judges, even though they’re plainly available and it’s plainly good PR to nominate them?
I don’t know. However, one possibility is that the outlier isn’t McGahn, but George Bush. For a Republican, he was, perhaps, unusually committed to finding nonwhite judges. By this hypothesis, McGahn is right on the trendline of Republican appointments over time, and there’s nothing to explain.

https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/09/is-bernie-sanders-a-nimby/,2019-10-02,,,politics,"September 24, 2019",Is Bernie Sanders a NIMBY?,Aaron Wiener,MotherJones,Politics,"In October 2017, David Sullivan read a surprising story in the paper: Bernie Sanders was holding a press conference to announce his endorsements for city council candidates in the upcoming elections in Sullivan’s hometown of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and neighboring Somerville. “Which shocked me, because I didn’t know Bernie knew anything about local politics,” says Sullivan, who himself was elected to Cambridge’s council five times in the 1980s. “And it turned out, he didn’t know anything about local politics.”
Sullivan was a member of Our Revolution, the political nonprofit Sanders had founded in 2016, and of the Democratic Socialists of America, which had endorsed Sanders for president that year and would do so again in the 2020 Democratic primary.* But the voting rights lawyer was also a volunteer with A Better Cambridge, a nonprofit that supports housing production and tenant protections and had recently made its own endorsements in the council races. There was no overlap between the group’s selections and Sanders’ picks, who were generally much more critical of new housing development, arguing that building additional market-rate housing wouldn’t make the city more affordable.
Of the five Cambridge candidates endorsed by the Vermont senator and the local Our Revolution chapter, four won seats on the nine-member council, including one newcomer who, according to Sullivan and other members of A Better Cambridge, was little known before Sanders backed him and would almost certainly not have prevailed otherwise. The most contentious matter facing the new council was a plan known as the 100% Affordable Housing Overlay, which would promote the construction of new affordable housing by allowing developers to build slightly taller buildings than currently permitted if they kept all the units permanently affordable to low- and moderate-income renters.
The overlay proposal had strong support from housing advocates in a city with a severe shortage of affordable rentals and a progressive commitment to equity. But it required a six-vote supermajority on the council to pass. The contentious deliberations finally came to a head this month. Two of the council members endorsed by Sanders opposed the plan, citing concerns about building design, the effect on the city’s tree canopy, and the potential for substantial increases in residential density in some areas. With the support of just five members, the plan was tabled.
“I’m convinced that if Bernie hadn’t gotten involved two years ago, we would have had the six votes,” says Sullivan. “So it’s a really awful thing he did.”
In Cambridge, as in liberal urban areas throughout the country, the deepest political fault line is generally not between the left and right, so vanishingly small is the turf claimed by conservatives. Instead, the line tends to divide supporters of greater housing density and its opponents. The “not in my backyard” (NIMBY) crew argues against policy changes that will allow more density, sometimes citing concerns about aesthetics, traffic, and parking, and sometimes arguing that an increase in market-rate housing won’t actually help lower-income residents. The “yes in my backyard” (YIMBY) crowd counters that there’s such an imbalance between supply and demand in the country’s thriving metropolitan areas that an overall increase in housing is needed—that the addition of a modest number of government-subsidized units for low-income residents won’t change the market forces that are making these areas unaffordable for the masses.
That fault line also runs through the field of progressive Democratic presidential candidates, though it hasn’t always been as obvious. Last week, Sanders became the latest candidate to release an ambitious housing plan. Like his rivals, Sanders pledged tenant protections and huge public investments in affordable housing. And, like his rivals, Sanders proposed federal incentives to induce cities and towns to loosen zoning restrictive codes and allow more homes to be built on the private market—similar to what Cambridge’s overlay would have done, but on a much broader scale and for housing across the income spectrum.

But on the campaign trail, Sanders has expressed skepticism of private housing development. At the NAACP presidential candidate forum in July, Sanders’ chief rival for the left-leaning bloc of Democratic voters, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), told the crowd, “I have a plan to build about 3.2 million new housing units in this country.” Sanders, by contrast, thundered, “We’re gonna tell the developers: You just cannot come in and build expensive condominiums!”
All of the Democrats agree on the need to shore up affordable housing, which has dwindled to crisis levels in high-demand metropolitan areas across the country, and to strengthen government-backed housing. The divisions arise over the role of the private housing market: Many housing advocates argue that there’s no conceivable way for the government to build enough housing to bring supply in line with demand in America’s most expensive areas. So absent those developers and their condos (or whatever types of housing the market demands), the math simply doesn’t add up.
The distrust of private housing developers among some liberals can lead to strange alliances. “The unfortunate effect of endorsing the people that Bernie Sanders endorsed,” says Eugenia Schraa, executive director of A Better Cambridge Action Fund, the political action committee affiliated with A Better Cambridge, “is that it helped people who claimed to be progressive but who—whether purposefully or not—end up allying with the most conservative faction of people in Cambridge, who tend to be wealthier, whiter homeowners, and enact policies that keep people out, including immigrants, young people, and newcomers of any kind.”
One clue to the genesis of Sanders’ approach to housing appeared during the most recent Democratic presidential debate, when the candidates were asked about the role of resilience in their lives and careers. “Resilience, to me,” Sanders responded, “means growing up in a rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York.”
If there’s a throughline in Sanders’ career when it comes to housing, it’s the powerful belief in the need for the government to protect Americans of modest means from predatory developers, landlords, and market forces. “It is not acceptable that, in communities throughout the country, wealthy developers are gentrifying neighborhoods and forcing working families out of the homes and apartments where they have lived their entire lives,” he wrote this spring in the Las Vegas Sun. Sanders’ national housing plan would not only massively expand the Section 8 rental assistance program but also cap rent increases in the private market at 3 percent (or 1.5 times the rate of inflation, if that’s higher).
Most housing advocates support this type of expansion of the government’s role in housing (though most economists, even progressive ones, are critical of rent control for its lack of means-testing and its tendency to reduce the supply of available housing). But no government effort will be enough, many of them say, without more market-rate housing, too. And it’s increasingly clear that cities aren’t going to add enough density on their own without a strong nudge from the state or federal governments—it’s just too easy for them to object to new development because of concerns about traffic or sunlight or “neighborhood character” and the enduring hope that housing gets built somewhere else.
Sanders’ national housing plan does call for zoning changes to encourage more housing. But because housing issues are overwhelmingly decided at the local level, his endorsements in local races may ultimately prove more consequential. His intervention in the Cambridge council race has probably changed the future of housing there more than he would be able to do as president. In recent years, as he has become a national icon of the left, Sanders has quietly exerted his greatest influence on local housing policies by throwing his weight behind candidates opposed to market-rate housing growth—not just in Cambridge but also in liberal enclaves in California, where the housing crisis is the worst in the nation.
Sanders has had a complicated relationship with the private housing market throughout his nearly four decades in elected office, starting with his time as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in the 1980s. His first political victory was built on a slogan: “Burlington is not for sale.” His target was a plan to redevelop the city’s waterfront with a hotel and 240 high-rise condos. In the flourishing college town, gentrification was a source of concern, says Garrison Nelson, a retired University of Vermont political scientist who has known Sanders for 40 years, and working-class residents were receptive to Sanders’ message. He won the 1981 mayor’s race by 10 votes. Housing-market pressures, Nelson says, tipped the balance.
In his memoir, Sanders would write about battling the real estate industry and the landlord association to push for rent control, kill the waterfront plan, and create a community land trust to preserve affordable housing. “Our campaign reminded the people of Burlington that the incumbent mayor and his local Democratic machine were in cahoots with the downtown business community and irresponsible ‘pro-growth’ forces,” he boasted. In reality, say people who worked with him then, Sanders’ relationship with developers wasn’t quite so clear-cut.
Once in office, Sanders took a pragmatic turn. He backed a second waterfront development plan that featured its own high-end condos, drawing substantial criticism from the left. (The Burlington anarchist Murray Bookchin wrote in the Socialist Review in 1986 that Sanders was a “centralist” running a “civic oligarchy.”) The city’s wealthiest areas supported the bond issue for the development, but the working-class wards that had backed Sanders’ mayoral campaign voted it down. Eventually, a different waterfront redevelopment plan was approved.
The push for rent control began before Sanders’ mayoralty, and “he kind of endorsed rent control but not with any passion,” says Greg Guma, a longtime Burlington writer and activist who has known Sanders since 1971. In the face of a more energetic campaign against rent control from city landlords, the measure was defeated in a citywide vote. “As soon as he saw the outcome, he backed away from it,” Guma says. “Rent control was never touched again for the rest of his term, for eight years.”
Sanders had more success with the community land trust, pioneering a structure in which a nonprofit takes control of land and imposes affordability requirements on all houses built there. Burlington’s land trust, which was established under Sanders in 1984 and later merged with another regional trust, remains the largest in the country and a national model—it now accounts for more than 7 percent of the city’s housing and has increased housing affordability and lowered homeowner foreclosure. (Some land trusts that have followed, including the second-biggest one, in Boston, have come under criticism for creating single-family homes and impeding the development of more housing units.)
Sanders ended up working closely with private developers on projects like the waterfront; one major local developer who was an early Sanders foil became a close friend and a regular partner. But it was useful to Sanders’ political narrative to cast them as antagonists, even after he’d begun working with them. “There’s always a villain,” Guma says of Sanders’ messaging to his supporters. “They’re always out to get him.”
If Sanders’ war on private housing development in Burlington was largely rhetorical, it would later become a lot more real—and nowhere more so than in the place with the most dire housing shortage in the country.
Between 2007 and 2014, as Silicon Valley boomed and workers flocked to the San Francisco Bay Area, the region granted permits for half as many housing units as it needed to keep up with population growth, due to restrictive local zoning codes. Home prices soared, San Francisco became the most expensive rental market in the country, homeownership became absurdly out of reach for middle-class residents across the region, and a homelessness crisis took hold. Alongside the latent NIMBYism that provoked the housing shortage, a YIMBY movement arose, and Scott Wiener became its public face.
In the spring of 2016, Wiener, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, was cruising to victory in his race for California State Senate. He had a huge fundraising lead and the endorsements of the state Democratic Party and the outgoing senator. Then he learned from a staffer that Sanders was about to endorse his Board of Supervisors colleague Jane Kim in the primary.
“It was 15 days before the primary, and at the peak of Bernie’s popularity,” Wiener says. “And I remember just thinking to myself, ‘Hold on, here it comes!’”
The race changed immediately. Sanders sent an email to supporters, asking to donate to Kim, describing her as “a civil rights attorney who’s fought for affordable housing and fair wages in her city.” Money poured in. “Thirty days before the primary, there was a poll that had me up 10 points,” Wiener says. “Over the final two weeks of the primary campaign, he campaigned with her, I believe, five times in San Francisco. He was with her constantly. And she edged me out in the primary.” (Kim says Sanders’ endorsement “had an impact” but also credits an ad she released for closing the gap with Wiener.)
Wiener went on to win the runoff election against Kim that November by two points, but Sanders’ endorsement nearly changed the face of the housing debate in California, whose shortage of homes is estimated as high as 3 or 4 million. In the Senate, Wiener introduced two landmark bills that would have allowed taller buildings around major transit stops throughout the state, barring cities and counties from preventing this denser development through restricting zoning codes. The affordable housing requirements were modest, but the idea was to slow the escalation of overall housing costs by bringing supply closer to demand. The measures launched Wiener to the forefront of the nationwide debate over housing affordability, though both of his proposals ultimately failed after contentious fights over density and local autonomy.
Kim opposed Wiener’s legislation because, she explains, “I do support mandates from the state on housing production goals, but allowing localities to determine where they’re built.” Wiener also criticized her for backing a moratorium on new housing in San Francisco’s rapidly gentrifying Mission district, a move she says was intended to give the city time to study ways to slow displacement of Latinos from the neighborhood. In her 2016 campaign, she said, “What we don’t want is to increase the supply of unaffordable housing,” suggesting that her goal was not growth in the city’s overall housing stock but projects guaranteed to create affordable homes. (In May, Sanders named Kim his regional campaign director for the Bay Area.)
Kim was one of four Bay Area candidates endorsed in 2016 by Sanders or his organizing group Our Revolution who came under criticism from YIMBY activists for their housing stances. Brian Hanlon, president of California YIMBY, was surprised when Sanders made his 2016 endorsements. “My first reaction was, does Bernie understand the local politics here?” he says. “He was supporting people who were identified as progressive, but many of these people had been opposing homebuilding, including affordable homebuilding, for years.”
For instance, for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Our Revolution endorsed Dean Preston over future mayor London Breed. Preston, considered the more liberal candidate, had criticized Breed for legislation she had proposed to allow greater density in the city without imposing new affordability requirements. He believes that market-rate housing isn’t helping in places like San Francisco, because “market-rate housing is completely unaffordable to the working class.” There are places, he says, where more overall density is needed, like exclusive suburbs, but not gentrifying cities where new market construction tends to be higher-end. He’s deeply critical of the YIMBY movement, saying, “Essentially the YIMBY view is that anyone who does not embrace unlimited housing, including market-rate, is anti-housing.”
Across the San Francisco Bay, in the 2016 Berkeley mayor’s race, Sanders endorsed Jesse Arreguín, another progressive who was sometimes critical of greater housing density. Berkeley is about as lefty as American cities come—Trump’s 3.2 percent of the vote there in November 2016 put him in third place, behind Jill Stein’s 4.6 percent—but it can have a stubborn anti-development streak in the face of the region’s severe housing shortage, a vestige of opposition to the destructive urban renewal plans of the 1950s and ’60s. On the city council, Arreguín had authored a 2014 measure that opponents argued would gut Berkeley’s downtown plan, which promoted density and housing, by imposing new restrictions on development. His aim, he said, wasn’t to impede density but to require more community benefits from developers who would take advantage of the new policy. Since many of his constituents lived near downtown and opposed increased density, he felt he needed to represent them. City voters rejected the measure by more than a 2-1 margin.
Laurie Capitelli, a council member and the outgoing Democratic mayor’s handpicked successor, was seen as the frontrunner in the mayor’s race prior to Sanders’ endorsement of Arreguín. “Bernie had a lot of supporters in Berkeley,” Capitelli says. His door-to-door canvassers reported that residents were bringing up Sanders’ endorsement in their decision-making on the mayoral race. Arreguín won with 47 percent of the vote.
“We’re convinced that the mayor’s race in Berkeley was tipped by Bernie’s endorsement,” says Matthew Lewis, communications director for the nonprofit California YIMBY, “and not in a good way.”
Arreguín would later call Wiener’s housing bill “a declaration of war against our neighborhoods.” But his most infamous stand against housing development centered on a single residential property in Berkeley. A developer bought a dilapidated house on a large lot and planned to replace it with three smaller homes. The plan was allowed under the city’s zoning, but Arreguín, still on the city council in 2016, voted to reject the building permit anyway, citing “out-of-scale development that will compromise the quality of life and character of our neighborhoods.” The state’s Housing Accountability Act requires cities to approve projects that meet the zoning code, so a judge forced the city to approve the permit. The next year, as mayor, Arreguín rejected the plans again, this time by denying a demolition permit. Again, a judge overruled him.
Arreguín says he didn’t oppose the project itself but simply wanted to challenge the parameters of the Housing Accountability Act to try to exert more local control. Asked about his opposition to the project while on the city council, before the Act had come into play, he says, “My recollection was that there was pretty strong neighborhood opposition to the project.” But he says that since becoming mayor, he has grown more supportive of housing density, given the city’s dire need for more housing, and that Berkeley is permitting and building more housing than it has in decades. “I will admit, my perspective on land use has changed, from what it was when I was representing downtown,” he says. “As mayor, I have to represent the entire city.”
In 2018, Sanders again waded into Berkeley politics. He made a single endorsement in California’s election for state legislature, in the race to represent Berkeley and the surrounding area. Politically, it made sense for Sanders to oppose Buffy Wicks, who had served as California state director for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. But again, the race turned on housing. Wicks declared, “We have a housing crisis,” and she promoted an “all-of-the-above approach” to remedying it. Jovanka Beckles, Sanders’ pick, who had voted against or abstained on several housing projects on the Richmond council, countered, “We don’t suffer from a housing shortage crisis. We’re suffering from a housing affordability crisis.” (Beckles says she opposed one project because it was located too close to an oil refinery and another because the developer “had unscrupulous practices.” She reiterates, “Right now there is no shortage of luxury housing…We have a shortage of affordable and moderate-income housing.”) Wicks ended up winning the seat.
“He’s endorsed all anti-housing people out here,” says Laura Foote, executive director of the San Francisco–based YIMBY Action.
It would be wrong to paint Sanders’ local endorsements as part of a deliberate unified strategy. Some of them were basically random: His backing of Arreguín came after a candidate for the Berkeley Rent Board allied with Arreguín happened to knock on the door of former socialist mayor Gus Newport, an old friend of Sanders from their mayoral days, while collecting campaign signatures and asked if he’d give Sanders a call. He did, and the endorsement followed. Sanders has admitted that his real interest is in national matters, not local ones, writing in his memoir about his initial run for Burlington mayor, “I knew very little about Burlington city government…In some ways, running for statewide office was easier than running for mayor because I was more familiar with the terrain of national and statewide politics.”
To the extent that Sanders was delving into local issues at all, it’s likely that he made some of his endorsements on the basis of issues other than housing. But in Cambridge, at least, housing was arguably the central point of disagreement among the candidates. “On most other issues, there’s wide agreement,” says Sullivan, the former council member. “This is a very progressive city. There is no real division within city politics except over this housing and zoning issue.”
The Sanders campaign declined interview requests and did not answer a list of questions about the senator’s history on housing. A spokesperson did note in an email that the California candidates Sanders endorsed also had the backing of other liberal leaders and groups. The spokesperson added, “To be clear, Sanders housing plan DOES NOT encourage high end developers and speculation.”
Some of the candidates Sanders declined to endorse, like Wiener, don’t blame the senator for his decision, instead faulting a problematic definition of “progressive” in liberal cities. “I think it’s a deeper problem: The progressive movement has failed on housing,” says Foote. “In every deep-blue city, it is shocking to pro-housing progressives that progressives in what should be thriving cities are very anti-housing.”
All of the pro-housing organizations have had strong Sanders support among their membership. Most of A Better Cambridge’s board of directors at the time of Sanders’ endorsements voted for him in the 2016 primary. (Sullivan, despite his Democratic Socialists and Our Revolution affiliations, backed Clinton.) Wiener says most of his 2016 campaign staff supported Sanders. But Sanders’ stance on housing has prompted some housing advocates to reconsider. Nearly every advocate who commented for this story is backing Warren in the 2020 race.
“This is the Elizabeth Warren-Bernie Sanders divide,” says Foote. “The entire YIMBY movement is falling in love with Elizabeth Warren.” She says Julián Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who also released a sweeping housing plan early in the race, is many people’s second choice.
Jesse Kanson-Benanav, who founded A Better Cambridge in 2012 and led it until earlier this year, soured on Sanders after the Cambridge endorsements and is now backing Warren too. “Even as a 2016 Sanders supporter,” he says, “I’m not on his team this time.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified David Sullivan’s membership in Our Revolution. Sullivan is a member of the national organization.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z
https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/stanford-sexual-assault-garden/,2019-10-02,,,politics,"October 2, 2019",A Virtual Memorial Brings a Sexual Assault Survivor’s Voice to the Stanford Campus,Madison Pauly,MotherJones,Politics,"Last Friday afternoon, Khoi Le adjusted the gray pipe cleaners keeping his glasses affixed to his face and surveyed the tiny garden at the south end of the Stanford University campus. A small crowd had gathered beneath a stand of pine trees. Water trickled over the edges of a small boulder surrounded by greenery. Small brown birds hopped on a pair of benches and a low retaining wall.
Over the past year, the garden had become an office of sorts for Le, a senior, and the other leaders of StanfordXR, a club for students interested in virtual and augmented reality. They’d spent hours working here on their laptops, building an AR version of the garden while trying to ignore the sounds of drinking games and music blasting from the Kappa Alpha fraternity next door, and, once, the smell of a roasting pig wafting from the yard of a nearby student residence. “Do you know what’s happened here?” Le wanted to ask the partiers. “There are some days when I’m out here, and I’m like, ‘Oh my god, I can’t believe I’m writing code where somebody was sexually assaulted.’”
Four and a half years have passed since the night two Swedish graduate students on bikes spotted a freshman named Brock Turner sexually assaulting Chanel Miller at this spot, behind Kappa Alpha’s dumpster, in the darkness beneath the pines. Turner was arrested and convicted, but he served only three months in jail. Miller’s powerful victim impact statement (published under a pseudonym by BuzzFeed News), generated outcry over Turner’s lenient sentence and fueled a successful campaign to recall the judge.
In the fall of 2016, Miller and Stanford reached an agreement: She would not sue the university, while it would pay her $150,000. It also would replace the dumpster where she was attacked with a “contemplative garden” that included lights for safety and a plaque with an excerpt of her choice from her victim impact statement. Over the next year, Miller writes in her new memoir, administrators shot down each of the quotes she selected. When Miller chose an excerpt that included the line “I had to relearn…that I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All American swimmer at a top university,” vice provost Lauren Schoenthaler wrote back that “our agreement was not to condemn a single individual.” When Miller offered another quote that had been widely cited in the media (“You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today”), Schoenthaler replied that university counselors concluded it could be “triggering and upsetting” to survivors. She offered three alternatives, including the words Miller had said to her sister after finishing a rape kit exam: “I’m right here, I’m okay, everything’s okay, I’m right here.” Miller stopped participating in the process, and, according to provost Persis Drell, her representative requested the garden make no reference to her at all.
The nameless garden, completed in the fall of 2017, is decorated with wooden benches and dark river pebbles, but no plaque. For the latest cohort of students, according to Stanford behavioral science fellow Jennifer Freyd, there is nothing to connect this shady spot to the viral story that shook the campus just a few years ago. “There are the students who don’t know anything about it, and for them it’s a pretty garden,” said Freyd, who coined the term “institutional betrayal” to describe how organizations like universities can inflict harm on their constituents, including sexual violence survivors. “For students who know the history, it’s understandable that now some of them feel betrayed. If Stanford were to put up the right kind of plaque, that would be institutional courage.”
Le and fellow VR/AR club leaders Hope Schroeder and Kyle Qian hadn’t been following the conflict over Miller’s plaque, which was first reported in an anonymous student publication in early 2018. That changed after they won a $35,000 “Magic Grant” from the Brown Institute for Media Innovation to build an app that could digitally replace Confederate monuments in Charleston, South Carolina, with memorials to civil rights activists. Charleston was nearly 3,000 miles away, so the team needed a local site where they could test a prototype. That’s when they learned about the garden.
“We had a major conflict of public space happening in our own backyard, and we had tools in our hands to do something about it,” said Schroeder, the project’s director. The three set about building an app called Dear Visitor, which virtually installed the plaque that Stanford wouldn’t. According to Le, they worried whether they were using the garden as an excuse to play with augmented reality, so they sought advice from historians and gender violence researchers. They won cautious support from campus administrators and also got Miller’s permission. “In Silicon Valley, tech has this reputation of people just trying to throw technology at things to fix it,” Le said. “What got me through was having friends who were sexually assaulted, being able to kind of give this back to them.”
By midafternoon on the day of the app’s “launch,” the small space around the garden had filled up with people. Qian, carrying a thick stack of iPads, hovered close to the first visitors, peeking at their screens and flashing them thumbs-up. (“It’s like the first steps of a baby,” he apologized.) Inside the app, which is experienced with an iPad and headphones, a gleaming 4-foot tall white monument stood next to the garden’s entrance, bearing Miller’s first chosen quote in golden letters; the second quote was inscribed on a plaque at the fountain’s foot. Tapping either excerpt played a recording of Miller reading from her statement. Above the fountain, flashing envelopes suspended in midair played interviews with students reflecting on Miller’s statement or the conflict over the garden.
The team had decided to release Dear Visitor as a one-time art installation. “This kind of experience is really emotionally taxing,” Le said. “In augmented reality, you’re starting to believe the digital objects are actually around you. But when the technology’s removed, suddenly you’re rushed back.” To help participants process their emotions after using the app, the team set up tables outside the garden where participants could write open letters responding to the experience, which Le planned to post on the Dear Visitor website.
When one student became emotional after finishing her walkthrough, Schroeder spoke to her quietly, assuring her she didn’t have to write a letter if it was too overwhelming. “I just don’t want to rush it,” the student said. “It’s a lot,” Schroeder nodded. She pointed her to another table, where students could make signs with quotes from Miller’s statement and hang them from a clothesline strung between the trees. “Maybe this would be a better activity, so you don’t have to bare your soul.”
Grace Dong, a senior majoring in symbolic systems, scribbled furiously at the letter-writing table, brow furrowed. “All of this started when I was in high school,” she said. “You have countless Stanford girls, women, 18-year-olds walking around this campus, and they know where not to walk. They know what not to do because of what happened to Chanel. It’s really disappointing that Stanford’s letting that happen.”
When Susie Brubaker-Cole, the vice provost for student affairs, arrived to tour the garden, the app developers watched her cautiously. Two days earlier, she had sent an email to the student body offering a “processing circle,” counseling, and trauma-sensitive yoga sessions to students struggling with feelings brought up by the release of Miller’s memoir. “We acknowledge that even on our campus, people can be harmed by others,” the email said. Brubaker-Cole fidgeted with the strap of her backpack as she listened to the recordings, then sat down alone to write a letter, which she didn’t sign. She wouldn’t speak with me, but before she left, she told Schroder that listening to the student voices helped her get a lot of “context” on the issue.
Up the hill from the garden, Michele Dauber, the Stanford law professor who led the campaign to recall Turner’s judge, held court with a small circle of gender studies professors. They discussed the merits of comparing the garden to a Holocaust memorial—a memorial ought to be “triggering,” they agreed, if it makes passerby stop and think—and criticizing Stanford’s handling of campus sexual assault. “They don’t see this as an atrocity,” Dauber said. “They see this as a miscommunication that happens over and over again.” She paused to introduce a student walking her bike up the slope, Betsy Kim, a sophomore who took Dauber’s class last year.
“She likes younger students so she can radicalize us early,” Kim said with a grin. “Oh no, no,” Dauber cut in hurriedly. “So I can teach them. Don’t use the word radicalize.”
Down the hill, Schroeder summoned the crowd of nearly 50 people to form a circle. One by one, participants stepped forward to read from Miller’s victim impact statement. Dressed in a “Fuck Rape Culture” T-shirt, Lezli Logan, a co-chair of the recall campaign, chose a passage about Miller losing her sense of independence. “I know this feeling well,” Logan told the circle before reading from Miller’s statement: “It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry.” When she finished, she was met with quiet snaps of support.
Back in the garden, Jessie Verhein, a MD-PhD student, shared a pair of headphones with a friend who was worried about giving her name, since her academic field had been rocked by a series of sexual misconduct scandals. “You can recover from one,” the friend said, sighing. But once a new incident is reported, “you have to spend an entire night reading about it, and get really mad.”
The two had been at Stanford longer than any of the current undergraduates, long enough to remember when Miller was known as “unconscious intoxicated woman” and then “Emily Doe”; when the site of the garden was still a frat’s dumpster. “I’m so mad that there isn’t a plaque,” Verhein said. Before today, she had avoided visiting the garden. “I guess everywhere you walk on earth, probably something terrible happened there, but—it feels weird.”
“Especially because it’s so clean and polished and nice,” her friend added. They sat for a while under the trees. If Stanford doesn’t install a plaque here, Verhein said, she’d like to leave a copy of Miller’s book, or maybe handwritten notes tucked into the stonework. “If nothing happens,” she suggested, “we can put something in a tree.” Her friend nodded. “Bring a Sharpie.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","Last week, as President Donald Trump was battered by headlines detailing a whistleblower allegation that he sought Ukrainian interference in the 2020 election, right-wing media outlets rallied to support him by pumping out stories downplaying the revelations.
“Democrats Wrote to Ukraine in May 2018, Demanding It Investigate Trump,” read the headline of the main story on Breitbart’s homepage on Wednesday. “Intel watchdog found whistleblower had ‘political bias’ favoring Trump rival: official,” read another on Fox News‘ site.
Extremely similar stories made their way onto fringe right-wing sites like 4chan and Reddit communities like The_Donald.
“Democrats Asked Ukraine To Investigate Trump—Last Fucking Year,” read the title of one of several similar 4chan threads on the topic, linking to Breitbart’s article or a Federalist one on the same subject. In The_Donald, a raucous and sometimes bigoted home for Trump supporters on Reddit, posts arguing the whistleblower was motivated by political bias against the president accrued thousands of likes.
All of these things might make sense to bring up, if true. But what the headlines and posts elided was that Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general who reviewed the whistleblower’s complaint, found that “arguable political bias” did not seem to undermine his allegations’ credibility. And that widely cited May letter from Senate Democrats didn’t actually include any call for Trump to be investigated.
The stories and posts show how the fringe internet and comparatively mainstream right-wing media—which have long influenced each other—have, in the wake of the Ukraine allegations, melded into a blob of garbled reactionary media that inhales mainstream news stories and spits out transfigured versions palatable to conservative audiences. Journalists who have long kept a steadfast eye on this media ecosystem have noted how these spaces, and the messages they present, are rapidly converging.
“If The Gateway Pundit and InfoWars formed a cable news channel, it’d look something like the 2019 version of Fox prime time programming,” CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy tweeted last week. “I’ve been tracking the right for the last 4-ish years of my life and I assure you this is not hyperbole,” Jared Holt, a Right Wing Watch reporter, affirmed in response. “The fringe has been ushered into the heart of power.”
In the past, hoaxes and reality-bending news stories in the mainstream conservative media usually worked their way up from sketchy blogs and troll-laden laden forums. During the 2016 election, two researchers at the non-profit Data & Society, Alice Marwick and Becca Lewis, documented how bad faith questions and hoaxes about Hillary Clinton’s health, circulating in right-wing mainstream media like Fox News, originated on 4chan.
“The claims started on 4chan, then [YouTuber and Infowars employee] Paul Joseph Watson started covering it, and then Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity were asking about it on their primetime Fox News shows,” Lewis recalled, noting how the false claims took hold and were used to question Clinton’s fitness for office.
Lewis, now a communications PhD candidate at Stanford, notes that while the trolls who make up 4chan and the like have often ridiculed more mainstream right-wing news, they also see the value they bring when the outlets spread their messages. “There has always been a sense that those sites are crucial for broadening the movement. That’s where far-right members want to recruit from,” she says.
Ahead of the fall of 2018 midterm elections, mainstream right-wing outlets and pundits, including Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, began pushing hoaxes and conspiracies not only about George Soros’ purported funding of a “migrant caravan” traveling toward the U.S.’s southern border, but also that a series of bomb threats on major liberal figures had been “false flags” orchestrated by Democrats in an attempt to win voters’ sympathy. The migrant caravan and bomb threats were real, but right-wing media outlets and pundits ascribed false origins to them, hoaxes that came directly from misinformation that had been circulating for months on Twitter’s fringe.
Lots of misinformation still travels this well-worn pathway. In July, a smear about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) marrying her brother made its way from message boards and social media into mainstream right-wing media and onto Trump’s Twitter feed. The unsubstantiated claim had been ebbing and flowing on the internet after an anonymous user posted about it on an obscure forum in 2016, before right-wing blogs picked it up and, in some readers’ eyes, brought a patina of legitimacy to the story with either paper-thin or nonexistent reporting.
Ben Collins, an NBC tech and internet reporter, has diagramed the phenomenon, dubbing it the “Human Centipede of Intentionally Bad Information.”

While Collins’s chart was designed to illustrate how false claims can gain credence moving up the right-wing media food chain, the flow and direction of bad information have gotten more muddled since he made it in 2018. Several incidents since news of the Ukraine whistleblower allegation broke illustrate that there can be little to no latency between what’s on forums and message boards and what’s on right-wing news websites and on Fox News, as hoax peddling sites and “normie” right-wing media move in near lockstep, sharing the same set of bad information about the story.
The_Donald and 4chan users are reviving months old conspiracies and dubiously reported stories from mainstream sources like Fox News and The Hill’s recently departed right-wing opinion writer, John Solomon, illustrating how the boards are using such storylines to help bend the narrative about Ukrainian corruption in misleading directions  that are more favorable to Trump.
There is nuance to this, and not everyone is on the same page: Fox News isn’t a total ideological monolith, with hosts disagreeing and some reporting more responsibly than others. The Drudge Report seems to have its own agenda that doesn’t necessarily fall exactly in line with top Republicans. But overall, the extended-right wing media universe trends more towards homogeneity than away from it.
According to Whitney Phillips, a Syracuse University communications professor who specializes in online misinformation and extremism, the Ukraine story’s prominence has meant misleading stories geared toward a right-wing audience are reaching an unusually large and influential audience.
“Those stories are unavoidable in a way that they weren’t in 2017 when the Seth Rich stuff was bubbling up on Fox News,” she says. “If you’re not really plugged into specific circles you probably wouldn’t really see it, or see the QAnon stuff, or the Pizzagate stuff. These Ukraine stories are all central now.”
In a way, the Trump administration gave a green light to the dissemination of false information when, within a month of its inauguration, it gave White House press credentials to The Gateway Pundit, which has served as a key intermediary between conspiracy-mongering right-wing troll forums and more mainstream conservative media.
“The relationship between these places has been happening for years,” says Phillips, adding that a merger of the fringe right-wing internet and its mainstream equivalents has been a long time coming. Phillips says Trump’s frequent retweets of QAnon supporters and his airing of conspiracy theories—including one he shared with Ukraine’s president, alleging wrongdoing by a cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate Russia’s 2016 hack of its computer systems—show he’s been complicit in building a distorted information landscape.
“This is the logical conclusion of where Trump has been heading the whole time,” she says.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

He Really Believes His Own Conspiracy Theories.,David Corn,MotherJones,Politics,"It’s been a long-standing question: Does Donald Trump believe his own crap? Does he truly think he has the best brain, that he is worth more than $10 billion, that there were more than a million people at his inauguration? And, in particular, does he accept the crazy conspiracy swill he so often slings: Barack Obama was born in Kenya, millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally in the 2016 election for Hillary Clinton (which is why he did not win the popular vote), Ted Cruz’s dad killed JFK? It could be that Trump spews falsehoods, exaggerations, and ludicrous tales mainly for effect. He knows this stuff is bunk, but he tosses it out to gain an advantage—to pump up his image, to feed his political base, to shape the political discourse, to distract from his own misdeeds. But what if he actually does believe this rubbish? Which would be more alarming: a president who is a serial liar or a president who is delusional?
The Trump-Ukraine scandal has revealed much about its chief player, who comes across as a crass operator in his phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, as Trump abuses the power of the presidency to muscle the Ukrainian leader into producing dirt that Trump can use for his own political purposes. But the quasi-transcript of this Godfather-like chat also answers the question posed above—and that answer is damn frightening.
As just about everyone now knows, during that July 25 call, when Zelensky told Trump that Ukraine wanted to obtain more Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States, Trump immediately replied, “I would like you to do us a favor though.” He then, in his word-salad way, asked Zelensky to investigate the theory that the Democratic Party computer servers that were hacked by the Russians in 2016 supposedly ended up in Ukraine, as part of a grand plot to create a hoax Trump-Russia investigation to block Trump’s path to the White House. (Trump was hardly this coherent in making his request to Zelensky.) Referring to Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference, Trump said, “They say a lot of it started with Ukraine,” and he noted  it was “very important” for Zelensky to investigate. Zelensky agreed to follow this path and pointed out that one of his assistants had already spoken about this to Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s chief henchman.
To be fair, you have to possess some background information to realize how bonkers this part of the conversation was. Trump was talking about one of the nuttiest conspiracy theories related to the Russia scandal—and he and his defenders have come up with a lot of bizarro alternative realities in their strenuous efforts to protect Trump. The basic theme they have been pushing for years is that Trump was set up by some Deep State cabal involving various US law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the Obama White House, the Democrats, the Hillary Clinton campaign, and, of course, the media (including me)—all of whom helped concoct a phony Russia investigation to delegitimize and stop Trump. And during his conversation with Zelensky, Trump zeroed in on one of the craziest variants of this favorite Big Idea of Fox News and the paranoid right.
Immediately after the Democratic National Committee in June 2016 revealed that its computer servers had been infiltrated and that a cybersecurity company called CrowdStrike had determined the hackers were Russian operatives, right-wing websites and chat groups began challenging this idea and promoting other scenarios. They focused on CrowdStrike, and eventually the theory emerged that the DNC was not infiltrated by the Russians and that CrowdStrike had moved the servers (which held the proof!) to Ukraine to prevent the FBI from inspecting them and learning the truth. (This theory overlapped with the debunked conspiracy theory that a young DNC staffer named Seth Rich, not Russia, had obtained the purloined DNC emails and passed them to WikiLeaks. Rich was murdered in an attempted robbery in Washington.) On 4chan and Reddit, Trump devotees advanced this idea that the DNC and CrowdStrike had fabricated the Russian attack. And, not surprisingly, Russian media outlets spread the tale. (BuzzFeed News has detailed this transmission belt of skulduggery.) So there was Trump echoing Russian propaganda and telling Zelensky, “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with CrowdStrike, they say CrowdStrike…I guess you have one of your wealthy people. The server, they say Ukraine has it.”
Of course, in the real world the facts were established by the Mueller probe, two congressional investigations (led by Republicans), and an investigation conducted by the intelligence community: Russia hacked the DNC to steal information it could use in its covert campaign to subvert the 2016 election. (The intelligence community concluded Moscow’s aim was to help Trump become president.) And the FBI had full access to the information that was on the DNC servers. There was no evidence the servers had been hidden from the bureau and transported to Ukraine. Mueller’s investigation and media reporting showed that while the Russians were hacking and plotting against the United States, Trump’s campaign was secretly interacting with Russian intermediaries and Trump was publicly encouraging Moscow’s assault, even as he denied the attack was happening and even as he sought to benefit from it. But if the Trumpers could prove the Russian hack never happened—that this whole story was conjured up by evil anti-Trumpers—everything else would be moot. Trump could not have aided and abetted an attack that didn’t exist, right?
One can see why Trump would want the DNC-servers-in-the-Ukraine story to be true—and why he might cast it out as part of his throw-anything-at-the-wall defense. But to believe this—in the face of every official finding and common sense—is an extreme act.
This past weekend, Trump’s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos that the Ukrainian theory has been debunked:
More disturbing, Bossert indicated that Trump is prone to believe fantastical and false stories when they match a desire: “I am deeply frustrated with what [Rudy Giuliani] and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the President. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again.”
Sticks in his mind—that is scary. A former Trump aide says the president of the United States cannot distinguish between facts and baloney when he wants the baloney. He does indeed believe the nonsense: There is a Deep State conspiracy that orchestrated a witch hunt to destroy him—and, whaddayouknow, the schemers did so at a time when few thought Trump would become president. (Yes, the Deep State was very prescient, but yet so bad at its job.)
This moment reminds me of the release a few months ago of text messages exchanged in 2017 and 2018 by Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. In these missives, Hannity, one of the most prominent proponents of Deep State nuttery on major media, and Manafort reiterate and reinforce the idea that dark forces are arrayed against Trump—and the two of them. Hannity tells Manafort that he fears the “establishment” wants to kill Trump and has engaged in “unreal corruption” to undermine his presidency. (That corruption consists mostly of the Trump-Russia investigation, including the prosecution of Manafort.) In this private conversation, Hannity lists the enemies, and, in fact, they match the foes he rails against on a nightly basis: “Deep State, Dems, Media, Weak Pathetic Rs, Never trumper[s].” Hannity refers to the “Comey Clinton mueller crime” family. And Manafort gushes, “You are so important to protecting our Constitution.” These Trump men do seem to see themselves as manning the ramparts against a nefarious and powerful secret coup. Hannity is not just saying this in prime time to sell ads.
It’s easy to dismiss Trump’s BS as, well, just BS. After all, Trump will publicly say anything to escape responsibility, change the subject, or cover up misconduct. He will claim an improper call was “perfect.” He will call for the arrest of a Congress member for treason. He will deny what he said an hour ago. An outrageous or offensive remark is often his best defense. But when he was speaking to Zelensky, he was not in front of an an audience (real or virtual). In private, he was expressing a priority and making a specific ask (or demand). And that focused on Zelensky producing information to confirm an utterly batty idea. Yet Trump regards this absurd idea as true. Why? Because he wants to. Because he needs it to be real. Because he does not care about reality. It was one thing for Trump to push Zelensky to come up with muck on Joe Biden and his son. That sort of material was within the realm of possibility (and it could probably be made up, if it doesn’t exist). But to concentrate on the servers conspiracy theory? This transcript shows that Trump is a prisoner of his own self-deception, a man untethered from the world of facts. It might be more reassuring if he was only an inveterate liar.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z
https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/black-workers-are-the-heartbeat-of-the-gm-strike/,2019-10-02,,,politics,"October 2, 2019",Black Workers Are the Heartbeat of the GM Strike,Eli Day,MotherJones,Politics,"The news she had been anticipating finally arrived, and Leatrice Strong, a 33-year-old Black woman and mother of four, felt a wave of nervous energy wash over her.
Not because she doubted that striking against General Motors was the right thing to do. “We’re just all standing for what’s right,” she told me. But the moment was still “nerve-wracking” for her. Strong, a temporary worker, had been at GM for just two months, transporting materials around the Detroit-Hamtramck plant, and now here was word that she and 49,000 of her colleagues would be bringing the machinery of GM to a sudden halt. It’s not easy being a temp worker. It’s really not easy being a temp worker on strike. “It was kind of hard to keep up with everything,” she said—especially “not knowing how long the strike was going to last.”
Of course, the stakes are enormous for all workers. The strike began September 16 after GM failed to reach an agreement with the United Automobile Workers. In a general sense, the walkout is an effort by the auto workers to reclaim some of the ground lost over the past dozen years. In 2009, GM received a $51 billion public bailout after filing for bankruptcy and in short order was flourishing again. Over the past three years the company has raked in $35 billion in North American profits. Its CEO, Mary Barra, has amassed a fortune, making over $20 million in each of the previous two years, 281 times the median GM worker, the Detroit Free Press reports. And since the bailout, the company has paid almost nothing in federal taxes.
But it’s the temporary workers like Strong who are at the center of negotiations, now in their third week. Temp workers make up 7 percent of GM’s US workforce and earn as little as $15 an hour at the start compared with the $30 an hour or so that so-called “legacy” workers make; temp workers are entitled to fewer benefits, too. These are features of the much-reviled tiered wage system that was installed in 2007, following a brief strike by 73,000 UAW members.
The wage tiers have awakened the old, overlapping fault lines of race and class within the auto industry. While the demographic breakdown for GM isn’t known, temporary workers across the American economy are disproportionately Black and Brown; economic precarity, of the kind described by Strong, has been more explicitly racialized.
Spend any time among the strikers right now and a picture emerges that should challenge one of the most broken assumptions about working-class life. Its icon is a middle-aged white man with rough hands and a long list of “what might have been”s. This image holds to this day despite being nonsense. By 2032, the Economic Policy Institute projects, a majority of the working class will be people of color. And nearly half of working-class adults are women. Right now the country’s most high-profile contract negotiations are underway in an iconically working-class profession. Those negotiations are being jammed up over the status of the most vulnerable, disposable class of workers—workers who tend to be Black and Brown. The GM picket line offers a glimpse of the new working-class arrangement, and it calls to mind a different sort of struggle, against a different set of “tiers.” Today’s fight for workplace equality doesn’t look all that different from yesterday’s fight for social equality.
“It’s all about making sure these temps…get the same pay as everybody else,” said Joe Ryan, who has worked at GM since 1978 and is responsible for training new hires in the plant. Even as GM dangles improved benefits for permanent workers, Ryan is unshakable. “If they talking about giving us $10,000 for a signing bonus,” he said “keep it. Don’t give it to us. Give it to the temps.”
I met Ryan on a Tuesday afternoon along the Detroit-Hamtramck picket line, where he coordinates strike activities. Some few dozen people were out picketing, and Ryan was on the move from one end of the strike area to the other, answering questions and preparing for the next shift of striking workers to arrive. Ryan has worked more years at GM than I’ve been a living specimen, yet he seems to be aging much more slowly than I am. He is clear-eyed on the rights of temporary workers, whose exploitation he views as plainly unjust. How else to describe a situation in which someone can be “working right beside me, doing the same job, and making less than me?” he asked in disbelief. “That ain’t right.”
In theory, this should trouble GM, a company that recognizes “the power of diversity” to “give GM a competitive advantage in the global marketplace,” Ken Barrett, global chief diversity officer, says in the company’s Diversity and Inclusion Report. The report chest-thumps that “GM supports equal pay for equal work” and calls “fair and equitable pay…an essential element of any successful business model.” In practice, the more insecure the temps, the better GM’s bottom line. More temps mean more “flexibility” for the company to add or fire workers at its fancy.
The racial aspects of this “flexibility” bear the imprints of an embarrassing history. As Thomas Sugrue writes in The Origins of the Urban Crisis, workers in post–World War II Detroit “forged some of the nation’s most powerful unions,” especially “the mighty United Auto Workers, one of the nation’s most powerful and influential labor organizations.” But the chances for improving one’s life, or even one’s position on the shop floor, were unevenly distributed. Black auto workers “faced formidable discriminatory barriers at some plants” where they confronted “bewildering and unpredictable” hiring practices. Once hired, blacks were funneled into “the least desirable jobs…in the dirtiest and most dangerous parts of the plant.” Employers “frequently used black labor as part of a classic divide-and-conquer strategy in the workplace”—as scabs, in this case.
Today, temps are completely at GM’s mercy in countless other ways. As the Detroit Metro Times reports, they can’t miss more than three pre-approved and unpaid days of work in a given year. Temps are also locked out of profit-sharing, in which the typical permanent worker gets around $1,000 for every billion GM makes in North American profits, despite the fact that many, like Strong, work full 40-hour weeks. And they can be forced to work every day—turning their weekend, a cherished labor victory, into a matter of company whim. But many hope to one day achieve full-time status, and so endure years of uncertainty and rickety economic prospects.
“It’s something that I’m cognizant of every day,” says Art Reyes II, a 52-year-old Flint electrician and third-generation GM employee who has worked in plants since he was 17. “People who are coming in as temps…are not afforded the luxury” that comes with full-time status, like preparing for a strike that could unfold into weeks.
For Reyes, this highlights both the difficulty and urgency of striking. “It is absolutely vital,” he added, “that our temps become permanent employees, because that will allow another generation…to have a middle-class lifestyle.”
GM also now turns jobs that used to be done by regular GM employees into contracting gigs, like custodial work. Even for Marjon Parham, a 44-year-old Black woman and engineering contractor at GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant, contracting work is “getting to be to a place where…there’s no security like it used to be.” After more than a decade as a contractor, she’s “a little nervous” because “everybody knows contracts are usually the first ones to be let go.” This is happening across the entire economy, as companies try to swap out traditional jobs with union-negotiated wages and benefits for independent contractors without them.
“We are our sisters’ and our brothers’ keeper,” Ryan said. “And we’re trying to do what our forefathers did back in ’36-’37” during the Flint sit-down strike. “You have to remember that that’s what they fought for—equality.”
Everyone, from the workers themselves to their supporters in the community, has shown “a lot of unity,” Strong said. And despite still feeling that knot of nervous energy, she hasn’t let herself be paralyzed by it. Instead, Strong has thrown herself into the arena. She now pickets three days a week, from 4 to 8 a.m. She feels “determined” when she’s out there, she told me, especially on days when her kids have joined her. “They came out and picketed with me. They showed their support for their mom—it felt great.”
“It feels good because I’ve never been in a situation like this,” Strong said. “I’m glad I can stand up for something that I feel is right.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The admission on Wednesday came on the heels of a Wall Street Journal report revealing that Pompeo had listened in on the call—an explosive detail he went to extraordinary lengths to avoid disclosing during a media appearance only ten days ago.
“I was on the phone call,” Pompeo told reporters at a press conference in Rome, Italy, before framing his involvement as standard for his role as secretary of state and US efforts to thwart the threat of Russia in Ukraine. “I know precisely what the American policy is with respect to Ukraine, it’s been remarkably consistent.”
But that explanation is unlikely to convince Democrats or really anyone who watched Pompeo on a September 22 interview with ABC’s Martha Raddatz. Pompeo repeatedly dodged the topic, instead rattling off misleading talking points on Ukraine and attacks against the Biden family, even when Raddatz directly asked him what he knew about the phone conversation now at the center of impeachment proceedings against Trump.
One explanation for Pompeo’s slow-walked admission could be a sternly worded letter Democratic committee leaders sent on Tuesday, warning the secretary of state that his efforts to block State Department officials from testifying on Ukraine could be used as evidence of obstruction. The letter also raised the possibility that Pompeo was violating several federal statutes, including some punishable by prison time.

Should we eat less? A panel of 14 researchers from seven countries—all of whom claim to receive no meat-industry funding—just produced a study finding no compelling reason to cut back.
There’s a catch, however: “Considerations of environmental impact or animal welfare did not bear” on their conclusions, the study states. The researchers looked purely at health considerations: whether eating red meat, and also processed meat (think preserved products like sausage, bacon, etc.) increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular trouble. After crunching data from dozens of red-meat and processed-meat studies, they found “low- to very low-certainty evidence” that reductions in either might produce slight decreases in bad health outcomes. The evidence was so shaky, and the potential health improvements so minor, that the panel concluded that adults can “continue current consumption” of burgers and sausages without major health consequences.
However, human health is about more than individual cases of heart disease or cancer. The US style of industrial meat production is a driver of climate change. And climate change brings all manner of health risks, from broadening the range of disease vectors like mosquitos to food shortages to increasing risk of deadly floods, fires, and heat waves. And there’s a pretty solid consensus that if we’re going to avoid the ravages associated with a 2°C rise in average temperatures over pre-industrial levels, then we’re going to have to cut way back on meat. I laid that case out here.
Back in 2015, when crafting the US Dietary Guidelines, which inform decisions on everything from agricultural subsidies to school lunch, the departments of agriculture and health and human services initially suggested that cutting down on read meat would not only bring health benefits, it would also be a more environmentally sustainable diet. After a backlash from GOP congresspeople and the food industry, the Obama Administration backed away from the environmental angle. “Issues of the environment and sustainability are critically important and they are addressed in a number of initiatives within the Administration,” a joint USDA/HHS press release stated.
But as for the dietary guidelines, the administration opted to “remain within the scope of our mandate” to stick to health advice, because dietary guidelines aren’t the “appropriate vehicle for this important policy conversation about sustainability.”
In the new study, that global team of researchers took a similar stay-in-your-lane approach to dietary advice. But the line separating public health and climate change is blurry. This graphic from another US government agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drives that point home.

From failed coups to a bevy of lawsuits to Russian ties to questionable spending practices, the nation’s leading gun-rights group has never been in worse shape. And now Senate Democrats are pushing for an Internal Revenue Service investigation into the organization’s tax-exempt status.
On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, sent a letter to the IRS outlining the findings of a Senate investigation into the NRA’s interactions with Maria Butina, a Russia pro-gun activist who last year pleaded guilty to conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent. “The findings of the report,” the letter states, “further suggest that NRA officials’ use of the organization to advance personal business interests may have exposed the NRA to further involvement” by Butina and Alexander Torshin, who at the time was a high-ranking Russian official said to be close to Vladimir Putin.
The letter also cites a number of news reports regarding the NRA’s financial woes and states that the organization “may have been engaged in other significant and persistent acts of potential private inurement and other impermissible acts.” Over the past year, there has been substantial reporting about lavish expenditures by NRA chief Wayne LaPierre and the questionable flow of funds to the group’s board members. Ever since former NRA president Oliver North leaked a controversial memo at the organization’s annual meeting in April detailing the group’s dire financial situation, there have been numerous calls for an IRS investigation. But two tax experts Mother Jones previously spoke to were not too optimistic that the IRS would follow through:

“This is a victory for people in Georgia and a reminder that these attacks on abortion access are illegal,” Talcott Camp, deputy director of the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project said in a statement. “Abortion is still legal in all 50 states. We won’t stop fighting until we defeat all efforts to block access.”
The ban, signed into law by Georgia’s Republican governor Brian Kemp in May, would have blocked most abortions once a doctor was able to detect a fetal heartbeat, which occurs around six weeks of pregnancy and is often before someone is aware of a pregnancy. The ban was intended to go into effect in January, but in June, the Center for Reproductive Rights, along with lawyers for the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, sued to prevent this from happening.
Georgia was one seven states—Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio—to enact similar abortion bans earlier this year, and all have been challenged in court. Following the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, many state legislatures rushed to pass anti-abortion bills in the hopes of getting a case to the Supreme Court that could overturn Roe v. Wade. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, state legislatures have passed more than 300 bills restricting abortion access this year, nearly half of which they say, “would severely restrict access to abortion.”
“The court recognized today that this law is blatantly unconstitutional and a clear attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade,” said Emily Nestler, Senior Staff Attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “Instead of passing laws that restrict the rights of pregnant women, Georgia lawmakers should be implementing policies that help pregnant women. ”
District Court Judge Steve Jones, who presided over this case, found that the law violated the 1974 Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade that guaranteed the right to an abortion for women by banning abortion before viability. “Under no circumstances whatsoever,” Jones wrote in his decision, “may a state prohibit or ban abortions at any point prior to viability.”
The Atlanta Journal and Constitution  reported that the governor’s office will be reviewing the Jones decision.
“Despite today’s outcome, we remain confident in our position,” Kemp spokeswoman Candice Broce told the AJC. “We will continue to fight for the unborn and work to ensure that all Georgians have the opportunity to live, grow and prosper.”
Anti-abortion groups also spoke out against the ruling.
“This is yet another demonstration of judicial activism against an overwhelming majority of Georgians who support protecting innocent life,” Joshua Edmonds, the executive director of the anti-abortion Georgia Life Alliance, told the AJC. “We will continue to fight to prevent Planned Parenthood and the ACLU from turning back the clock on human rights in Georgia.”

When environmental groups and five Native American tribes fought back in court, the Trump administration tried to dismiss the legal challenges they raised. But on Monday, a federal judge turned down Trump’s attempt to block the lawsuits, the Salt Lake Tribune reported, meaning that the battle to preserve the national monument will continue.
Bears Ears, a 3.5-million-acre stretch of canyons, buttes, and desert plateaus, is notable not only for its stunning geologic formations, but also for its Native American cultural, religious, and archaeological sites. Former president Barack Obama designated Bears Ears as a national monument in 2016, despite pushback from Republican lawmakers in Utah.
A year after Obama’s designation under the 1906 Antiquities Act, Trump made the unprecedented decision to cut the area of Bears Ears from 1.35 million acres to 201,876 acres, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. He also tried to cut the size of another Utah national monument, Grand Staircase-Escalante, in half. The question at the heart of the current legal fight is whether Trump has the authority under the Antiquities Act to overturn his predecessor’s designation. In the meantime, in case it is ruled that he does, energy companies are hungrily eyeing the area’s oil and natural gas deposits.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Dowd represented Trump in matters relating to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe until March 2018. Dowd’s new clients, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are key figures in the burgeoning Ukraine scandal and appear to have worked closely with Giuliani in his efforts to discredit the Mueller investigation.
Parnas, a Florida businessman and would-be movie producer with a string of debts, said in a text message Wednesday that he had retained Dowd. Dowd confirmed in an interview that he had agreed to work for both Parnas and Fruman, whose has business ties in the Ukrainian city of Odessa. Dowd declined to discuss the details of the arrangement. “I haven’t had a chance to meet with them,” he said.
The hiring highlights the tight links between the president’s current and former attorneys and others involved in the growing scandal that was triggered by the revelation that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into digging up damaging information about Trump’s political opponents. Giuliani, who currently represents Trump, has said he was hired by Parnas and Fruman as their lawyer and worked with them to unearth information related to Biden and the Mueller probe. Giuliani tweeted in May that the men “are my clients.”
Dowd also remains in contact with Trump, who he described on Wednesday as a friend. “We talk every once in a while,” Dowd said in a telephone interview. Giuliani told the Daily Beast in January that Trump at that time occasionally sought Dowd’s advice on legal matters. But Dowd said Wednesday that he no longer provides legal counsel to Trump. “He has his own lawyers to do that,” Dowd said.
Dowd had a controversial tenure as Trump’s lawyer. In September 2017, a New York Times reporter wrote up a conversation he overheard at a popular Washington restaurant between Dowd and another Trump attorney about Trump’s defense strategy. In November 2017, as former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn prepared to cut a deal to cooperate with Mueller, Dowd left Flynn’s attorney a voicemail, in which Dowd seemed to float the possibility of Trump pardoning Flynn. Dowd has denied that he was hinting at a pardon, and he accused Mueller’s staff of selectively editing a transcript of the call.
Parnas and Fruman, who live in South Florida, became big GOP donors in 2018, giving at least $576,500 in combined donations over several months. According to reporting by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, they used the resulting access to powerful Republican figures to promote a plan to sell American liquified gas to Ukraine. In May 2018, the duo dined with the president at the Trump International Hotel.
According to the OCCRP/BuzzFeed report, Parnas and Fruman encouraged Giuliani’s effort to promote the conspiracy theory that Biden in 2016 forced the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in order to block an investigation of a natural gas company that had put Biden’s son, Hunter, on its board. There’s no evidence for that allegation; Shokin was ousted in part because of widespread international criticism over his failure to combat corruption. Parnas says he and Fruman first put Giuliani in touch with Shokin and that they also connected Giuliani late last year with Shokin’s successor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who leveled—and later retracted—accusations about the Bidens.
On Monday, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Giuliani. It also asked Parnas and Fruman to turn over documents and to agree to be questioned. That demand appears to have led to them hiring Dowd.
Dowd said Wednesday that Parnas and Fruman are his only clients involved in the Ukraine scandal. “That’s enough,” he said.
Giuliani declined Wednesday to answer questions about his relationship with Parnas and Fruman, including when they retained him and how long the engagement lasted. “Who cares[?]” he wrote in a text message. “As Nero is burning Rome you’re trying to figure out if the Fire Department is to blame. Respectfully you are chasing the irrelevant.”
Asked if he was comparing Trump to Nero, Giuliani said he meant Biden.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Donald Trump is just raving these days, both online and off, and a few minutes ago he practically melted down in public while the president of Finland stoically stared into his hands. Meanwhile, his secretary of state is flatly stonewalling Congress and—unless I’ve missed someone—not a single elected Republican is willing to even mildly criticize Trump, let alone support an impeachment inquiry.
Do the details even matter anymore? I suppose they do—or, more accurately, they might eventually. Maybe there’s some limit that even Fox News can’t quite spin away. Maybe.
In the meantime, just remember this: Joe Biden went to Ukraine in 2015 to demand that they crack down harder on corruption. That included investigations of Burisma, the energy company where his son sat on the board. In the real world, this is uncontroversial. Everybody agrees this is what happened. But in Foxland, Biden went to Ukraine to make sure they stopped investigating Burisma.

If so, the Trump administration is here to help!
The US Department of Health and Human Services has created a webinar entitled “Focusing on Fertility,” to introduce you to the world of “fertility awareness,” a method of natural family planning that involves charting your menstrual cycles, your daily body temperature, and the consistency of your vaginal secretions. An approach once largely the province of the Catholic Church, where the rhythm method reigned supreme, fertility-awareness based methods (FABM) are its more sophisticated successor. But now, courtesy of the Trump administration and your tax dollars, anyone can learn how to avoid getting pregnant with natural methods that HHS claims “are up to 98 percent effective” at preventing pregnancy.
The president may be a philandering, twice-divorced libertine, but the fertility-awareness webinar is yet another example of how much the religious right is driving his administration’s social policy. Alex Azar, an anti-abortion, Orthodox Christian who considers Vice President Mike Pence a mentor, is the head of Trump’s HHS. He has stocked the agency with like-minded lieutenants, and together they have reshaped HHS women’s health programs to suit the agenda of evangelical Christian and Catholic activists who not only oppose abortion, but also most forms of birth control and comprehensive sex education.
To that end, the agency has gone all in for so-called natural family planning, even as it has been methodically dismantling programs that broaden access to effective contraception. Last year, after imposing draconian anti-abortion rules on the Title X program that led Planned Parenthood to relinquish $60 million in funding and drop out, the administration rewrote the criteria for organizations applying to receive Title X family planning grants. The new grants prioritize groups that promote abstinence and FABM, as opposed to contraceptives. This year, HHS awarded a $1.7 million, three-year Title X grant to a Catholic nonprofit, Obria, to provide family planning services that only include natural family planning and abstinence counseling but no more conventional methods of birth control—not even condoms.
The FABM webinar, which aired live in June and is now on YouTube, was done in partnership between the Office of Population Affairs, which oversees Title X, and the Center for Faith and Opportunity Initiatives—the religious outreach arm first created by President George W. Bush, which Trump revived at HHS in May 2018 through executive order. The center is run by Shannon Royce, an anti-LGBT and anti-abortion activist who previously worked at the evangelical Family Research Council and who has been instrumental in the Trump administration’s rollback of health protections for transgender people.
The webinar’s lead presenter is Marguerite Duane, a doctor who runs the non-profit advocacy group FACTS: the Fertility Appreciation Collaborative to Teach the Science. She is trained to teach the Creighton Model, a natural family planning method developed by the Pope Paul VI Institute for the Study of Human Reproduction. Founded in 1985 by a (male) Catholic doctor in Nebraska to build “a culture of life in women’s health care,” the institute is named for the pope who issued Humanae vitae, the controversial 1968 encyclical forbidding Catholic women from using contraception.
An outspoken critic of birth control as harmful to women, Duane is not exactly a dispassionate medical professional. She made some waves in 2017 when she wrote a piece in the conservative periodical The Federalist arguing that the reproductive-rights activists seeking to make contraception more accessible through the Affordable Care Act were ignoring the science about its risks. Indeed, she questioned the premise that birth control was even “necessary” for women’s health.
She is also a member of a grassroots advocacy group called Women Speak for Themselves that was organized in 2012 by a Catholic law professor to fight the ACA’s contraception mandate in court and public opinion. According to their website, the group represents the thousands of women who had “experienced the ways contraception and abortion have immiserated women.” In 2012, the group wrote an open letter to President Obama and HHS arguing that “government contraceptive programs inevitably change the sex, dating and marriage markets in ways that lead to more empty sex, more non-marital births and more abortions.”
None of this background is conveyed in the HHS webinar, which identifies Duane as a board-certified family practitioner and adjunct associate professor at Georgetown medical school. Katelyn Walls, a special assistant at the HHS Center for Faith and Opportunity Initiatives, kicks off the webinar by noting, for housekeeping purposes, that it is solely educational and “off-the-record and not intended for press purposes.”
Walls first introduces Diane Foley, the deputy assistant secretary in charge of the HHS Office of Population Affairs, which oversees Title X. Foley is also a doctor and anti-abortion activist who is morally opposed to birth control. A vocal opponent of comprehensive sex education, she once suggested that showing high school students how to put condoms on bananas could be “sexually harassing.” But on the webinar, she shows no such prudishness in welcoming viewers for a graphic online discussion of vaginas, lubrication, menstrual cycles, sperm, and of course, sex.
After explaining that her office has a mandate from Congress to promote natural family planning, Foley introduces Duane. She begins her power-point presentation by stating that despite what people may have heard, “Modern fertility-based methods are not the rhythm method.” They are based on science, she insists. Duane guides viewers through the monthly stages of a woman’s fertility and describes the changes in cervical mucous that occur throughout the cycle—from “cold, dry” to “moist, fertile,” according to one slide that poetically compares the cycle to the seasons.
How effective is this method of pregnancy prevention? “Effectiveness rates are about the same as the pill and better than condoms,” Duane asserts. Fertility-awareness based methods, she says, have been proven to result in an unintended pregnancy rate of less than 2 percent a year.
For women familiar with the major pitfalls of rhythm method, i.e. that it doesn’t work, 2 percent is a staggering statistic—a figure on par with the most effective forms of implantable contraception like the IUD. It’s also wildly misleading. Here’s why: Most of the research on the effectiveness of FABM is junk science. In a systematic review published in the medical journal Obstetrics & Gynecology in 2018, researchers from a wide range of ideological perspectives, including FABM proponents, looked at virtually every study ever done on the effectiveness of fertility awareness methods. They concluded that the vast majority of the 53 studies they identified were of low quality.
Some that focused on Duane’s Creighton Model were among the worst, in part because of the unusual way investigators classified pregnancies. If a woman using the Creighton method got pregnant after having sex on a fertile day, the investigators assumed this was “achieving [pregnancy]-related behavior.” Chelsea Polis, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health organization, and one of the authors of the 2018 systematic review, explains that effectiveness studies for other contraceptive methods would have counted those pregnancies as a contraceptive failure. But investigators on most Creighton studies considered those pregnancies a success. After all, investigators assumed, if a woman got pregnant on a fertile day, she must have intended to do so, and they excluded those pregnancies from the failure rate. “Excluding these pregnancies could substantially underestimate Creighton failure rates,” Polis says, “making estimates for the method look more effective than they may actually be.”
Even the better studies were flawed. The authors concluded that the effectiveness rate of the various FABMs could vary wildly, from a low of 1.8 or as high as 34 percent—a rate twice as high or higher than some of the least effective forms of birth control such as an old-fashioned diaphragm or condom. In an email, Duane argued that the low-quality studies tended to be older, and very small, and that “more recent high quality studies demonstrate these methods can be used effectively to prevent pregnancy.”
Even before the 2018 systematic review, the Centers for Disease Control has long pegged the failure rate for FABMs at a pretty dismal 24 percent, a figure that has irked natural family planning advocates. Critics have argued that the CDC’s figure unfairly lumped the rhythm method in with more effective modern biomarker-based fertility awareness methods that use ovulation detectors and other tools. In May 2017, Duane’s FACTS launched a petition drive to demand that the CDC adjust its published failure rate based on newer studies to make FABMs look better compared with other forms of birth control. The petition never garnered many signatures and was never submitted. Nonetheless, this year, the CDC reassessed its public data and now says the failure rates for FABMs vary from 2 to 23 percent. (HHS launched the fertility webinar in response to that adjustment, according to a spokesperson.)
Despite the CDC’s adjustment, Mary Alice Carter, senior advisor to the HHS watchdog group Equity Forward, says HHS is being irresponsible to suggest in the webinar that fertility awareness works as well as contraception. The Trump administration, she says, is “propagandizing against the pill and other hormonal forms of birth control in favor of these fertility awareness-type methods, even though we know they are not the most effective or the best choice for most people.” She says that if you look closely at the research, it’s clear that achieving a 98 percent effectiveness rate through fertility awareness is extremely difficult. “The amount of perfection it requires and the amount of steps it requires,” she says, “would put it out of reach for most people.”
There is a reason that fewer than 2 percent of American women use some sort of fertility awareness method to prevent pregnancy—and is likely also the reason that only 118 people signed on to watch the fertility webinar air live. The most effective natural methods aren’t particularly useful for impulsive teenagers, for instance, or, say, Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels. They require intensive training, including hours of classes over many months, and dedication to tracking all the various biomarkers—from daily body temperature to cervical mucus to urinary hormone metabolites—not to mention a joint commitment to periodic abstinence. “It takes a particular kind of relationship and context and user to make these [methods] work,” Polis says.
In the webinar, Duane allows that FAMB is high-maintenance and urges viewers not to simply try using one of the many online apps devoted to tracking fertility without proper instruction from a trained professional like herself. (The FDA recently approved an app called Natural Cycles as a medical device for contraception.) Perhaps more importantly, she recognizes that natural family planning requires a cooperative partner. “These truly are shared methods of family planning,” she says.
The limitations of FABM, and their distinctly religious foundation, raise the question of whether the fertility webinar is really the best use of HHS resources. Mara Gandal-Powers, director of birth control access at the National Women’s Law Center, says FABM has a role to play as one of a wide range of options for women, but the demand is still very small. She thinks it’s not something the government would be prioritizing “if they were being responsive to family planning providers or women.”
But natural family planning isn’t just about preventing pregnancy, Duane assures us in the webinar. It offers wide-ranging health benefits. Once embarked on fertility awareness, women will find these methods can help them deal with PMS, recognize menopause, and even get pregnant, according to the webinar. (As proof of concept, Duane has four children, whose timing she credited in an email to her line of work.)
After Duane wraps up her spiel with a plug for natural family planning as an antidote to the mainstream medical complex, Lisa Jurski takes over. A physical therapist, Jurski also teaches the Creighton method in Chicago and is here to persuade viewers that spending months trying to accurately work out their fertility window and then giving up sex for 12 days every month is preferable to just getting an IUD or going on the pill.
She admits that “abstinence is commonly cited in the mainstream medical literature as a disadvantage of FABMs.” Not to worry, she counters. FABMs have gotten a bad rap. People who use natural methods, she says, in fact find that they have better sex as a result, albeit less frequent. “Periodic abstinence increases their anticipation,” she says imparting a secret about the male libido.
Among her other big selling points: Research shows that natural family planning is good for your relationship. Women who use these methods, she says, “report feeling more respected and less used.” The divorce rate among couples using fertility awareness methods is only 1 percent, according to one study Jurski cites. It’s easy to see why, she explains. “If you can talk about cervical mucus, you can talk about anything.” Another likely reason, unstated, is that all those couples who are most committed to using fertility awareness just could be devout Catholics and conservative Christians who are opposed to divorce.
The webinar is not a detailed guide for personal use. For more information and assistance in choosing the right method for you, Jurski directs viewers to the website of a group called Natural Womanhood, a nonprofit opposed to hormonal contraception. It’s run by Gerard Migeon.

In a 130-page ruling, US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs concluded that Harvard’s admissions process “passes constitutional muster” in using race as one factor in determining how it admits students to the university. The court found no evidence of “any racial animus or conscious prejudice against Asian Americans.”
The decision dealt a blow to Students for Fair Admissions, a group of Asian American students who sued Harvard in 2014. The case represented a pivot in challenging affirmative action that pitted one minority group against others. In this case, the group’s attorneys argued that Harvard effectively created a quota for how many Asian students the university would admit and penalized Asian applicants by holding them to a higher standard while giving preference to black and Hispanic students. An analysis of Harvard’s student records conducted by Students for Fair Admissions concluded that while Asian applicants scored higher in academic and extracurricular measures than their peers, they received lower ratings on more subjective criteria like a “personality rating.” The court found that the university did not impose “racial quotas or otherwise engaged in impermissible racial balancing.”
“The students who are admitted to Harvard and choose to attend will live and learn surrounded by all sorts of people, with all sorts of experiences, beliefs and talents. They will have the opportunity to know and understand one another beyond race, as whole individuals with unique histories and experiences,” Judge Burroughs concluded. Until race is no longer considered a defining feature in a person’s life, “race conscious admissions programs that survive strict scrutiny will have an important place in society and help ensure that colleges and universities can offer a diverse atmosphere that fosters learning, improves scholarship, and encourages mutual respect and understanding.”
Students for Fair Admissions is led by activist Edward Blum, a longtime opponent of racial preferences who was behind a 2016 Supreme Court challenge to the use of race in college admissions at the University of Texas at Austin. In that case, involving a white student named Abigail Fisher, the Supreme Court upheld the university’s admissions process.
Tuesday’s ruling is just the opening salvo. Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, noted in a statement that the group was “disappointed that the court has upheld Harvard’s discriminatory admissions policies” and planned to appeal Burrough’s decision.

The walkout of more than 49,000 General Motors auto workers comes on the heels of a series of successful strikes by workers around the country—teachers and nurses and beyond.
Though it had fallen out of favor, the strike—the most effective weapon workers have at their disposal—is back with a fervor not seen in decades. Why? “Workers are pissed off in this country,” says Jane McAlevey, a veteran labor organizer and author of Raising Expectations (and Raising Hell) and No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age. But that’s only part of the explanation, McAlevey says. Workers strike when they see that strikes work. Her next book, A Collective Bargain: Unions, Organizing, and the Fight for Democracy, will be released in January 2020.
I recently spoke with McAlevey by phone to discuss America’s wave of walkouts, why the strike disappeared, why the Chicago teachers strike in 2012 is so important, and how to effectively organize a strike. McAlevey had just returned from an hourlong run when I reached her. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
We’ve taken notice of all of the strikes that have been unfolding, or are upcoming—
It’s so good.
What’s that?
My run, the water I’m drinking right now, and the strikes.
Ah, yes, the Holy Trinity. So I thought now would be a good time to get a better idea of strike strategy and what makes striking so important, when organized properly. For a long while strikes had really fallen out of favor. But in the past few years, we’ve seen quite a lot of them, and quite a few successful ones at that. What has changed?
The reason we’re seeing so many is because there have been so many successful strikes. Workers learn to strike when they watch other workers strike and win. That’s where the formula is playing out right now. To put a pinpoint on it: Most people are saying they began in February 2018 with the West Virginia strike. I think the truth is the beginning was the Chicago teachers strike in 2012. It’s that incredible education strike that took Chicago by storm for nine days, that really began to raise workers’ expectations that the strike could win again in the post-Reagan environment.
What’s the history there?
Basically, what happens is Reagan replaces 12,000 air traffic control workers who were striking in 1981. This wasn’t like replacing workers who were easy to replace; it was replacing hard-to-replace people with a very serious skill. And he didn’t just fire 12,000 workers; he destroyed their lives. Many of those workers never got jobs again. They destroyed the union—it went bankrupt.
So that’s 1981, and that was coming on top of pulling out of the financial crisis in New York City in 1976. The ’70s were sort of the beginning of the shortcomings of the postwar boom years in the United States.
The downward pressure begins in the private sector. It’s the beginning of moving jobs outside of the United States. If they’re not moved outside of the United States, a lot of unionized, good manufacturing jobs have already begun to move from the Northeastern and Midwestern states into the union-busting “right to work” Southern states, where they were de-unionized when they reopened. A lot of workers in the so-called private sector—think of them as the manufacturing sector—were feeling a lot of pressure by the late 1970s, vulnerable that they might lose their job if they go on strike, and they were happy to hang on to a good union job. And then you’ve got Reagan firing people in 1981. The combination of the two was devastating. Unions begin to think: “We can’t really use the strike weapon anymore.”
I would say that the officialdom of the trade union movement in the 1980s were very risk averse. They assumed that the basic decent contract standards they had would last forever. They felt more comfortable sitting down at the table with management. They were missing the giant threat on the horizon of their own inaction. In my second book, No Shortcuts, when I give the history of the birth, the rebirth, the collapse, the rebuild of the Chicago Teachers Union, I say that leaders like in Chicago, who had taken over that union in the 1980s, were just risk averse and didn’t really believe in striking and were scared of striking. They began to use the Reagan example as an excuse of why we could never strike. Then in the 1990s and 2000s, the strike does actually recede dramatically.
By the time I came back to organizing full time, which is 1996, there’s a lot of talk about beginning to organize again. But if you look at it retrospectively, the conversation about “we’re going to organize all over again” never really included the conversation about workers’ ultimate power, which is the strike weapon. It wasn’t like, “We’re going to fight to the death to win again.” It was: “We’re going to organize again. We’re going to grow the labor movement again.” That commitment to organizing was really a commitment to growth. And it was growth in, I think, a kind of narrow way: “We’re going to grow the union membership.”
For some of us, we were always running strikes for that whole period of the new wave of the trade union movement. They just weren’t quite as big as the strikes we’re seeing now, and they didn’t get the attention they deserved. But we were largely winning, so for some of us it was like, “If we prepare well, and we bring the whole community in and the members are ready to go, some of us are really winning very good standards in contracts right now.” So the debate’s been going on for decades.
A little illness knocked me out of the ring for a while, and that’s how I decided to start writing the first book because I think it’s worth telling a story about, hey, for the last 10 years, a bunch of us were helping workers learn to fight and win, using strikes and being militant and seeing the community as the primary ally. So it’s gurgling the whole time, and when the progressives inside of the Chicago Teachers Union run for office against what we call “do-nothing leadership” and win in 2010, at that point their contract was expiring 12 months later. They had very little time to rebuild an entire union, but rebuild it they did, because, like you’re seeing in other states now, it’s a reflection of how much anger exists at the rank-and-file base. Workers are pissed off in this country. It’s a seriously pissed-off country where people are frustrated, upset, hurting, living lives of misery.
The Great Depression in the late 1920s, early 1930s, the abject misery was somehow more visible, because the absolute unemployment rate was 25 percent. So people saw the misery more readily. But I think what’s happening today is a more disguised form of equal levels of misery because it’s grotesque underemployment. It’s like capitalism learned not to fully unemploy everybody this time, but just string them out. If you look at underemployment, unemployment, precarious positions, workers working two jobs to make ends meet, two-parent households working four jobs to raise the kids, hardly ever seeing their kids, switching the kids up between day shift and night shift, not having money if there’s a health care crisis, not making their car loan payments, and in debt as 60 percent of Americans are right now, it’s hard to argue we’re not at a pretty high state of misery, and people are pissed.
The way I’m looking at the timeline of what happened: Chicago sets an example. They have this extraordinary strike in 2012. It takes everyone’s breath away in the most exciting way. What they show, significantly, is that despite the movie Waiting for “Superman” and despite the rise of the Wall Street–funded charter school movement, despite a multimillion-dollar campaign to give teachers a black eye and blame them for the underfunding and defunding of public education, what people saw and took their breath away was: “Hey, wait a minute, the community in Chicago rallied around those teachers. They didn’t blame them. They stood with them.” And when workers in the rest of the country, especially teachers, saw that parents sided with teachers, that to me is the beginning of the spark.
What was the jump from then to the 2018 strikes?
What happens is a bunch of Chicago teachers who are progressive folks, they get involved in the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, and there’s a flow of information and a flow of relationships that begin to build. There’s a whole network of teachers meeting around the Bernie Sanders campaign. That’s absolutely how the information flowed into West Virginia, which is the first one of the next round in 2018. This is a key linkage through the Sanders campaign. They’re young. Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in every single county in West Virginia. So you have fired-up young teachers in West Virginia, who were the Bernie Sanders troops on the ground, who actually thought that he really had a shot of winning, right? He doesn’t win. A year goes by. A whole lot of energy is going on in West Virginia with these young smart teachers, and then right as they’re thinking, “What do we do now with all this energy we’ve built up?” the state proposes to take away their health care, to impose profound, huge cutbacks in their health care, that’s going to make them pay a lot more money—they’re going to have to wear something like a Fitbit on their wrist, to try and keep their premiums down.
This is a state with one of the highest poverty rates in the country. They’re going to blame people’s health on why they’re going to make them pay more for health care. It’s really insulting, and as the teachers say in my forthcoming book, a huge insult to their intelligence and their sense of privacy and their sense of dignity. And that sense of dignity is big. That was the final straw. Finally they said, “Okay, enough is enough, we’re going to start to build something here.” And they began to organize.
I think that had Chicago not happened, we don’t know what would’ve happened in 2018. When I started the call by saying workers learn to go on strike by watching other workers go on strike and win, that Chicago strike was the beginning of the first time people really saw workers winning big in a high-risk, all-out strike in a major city in America.
And then, boom: They win, and that sets off a whole round of strikes. Fast-forward to now. There’s the General Motors workers, who absolutely deserve to win this strike. Everybody needs to throw their weight behind these striking workers because it’s across multiple states; it’s in a historic sector of the economy; and it’s a way to say to a company that American taxpayers bailed out for $11 billion, “Give us, in the form of the workers, some of that taxpayer money back, put it in the pocket of the workers in the communities who deserve it.”
Since you bring it up: I’ve read about how corrupt UAW leadership is and how a lot of the workers didn’t know the specific demands that leadership was making of GM. How do workers win under those conditions?
I interviewed some workers who learned about the strike the same day the media did. As someone who’s run a bunch of strikes, I would say it’s certainly not the approach I’ve ever been involved in. When we’re getting ready to strike, there’s tremendous rank-and-file-worker involvement. There’s a build up to a strike where you’re doing lots of preparation; you’re doing picket-line training; you’re recruiting captains; you’re building a contract action team; you’re shoring up and being sure that that each facility has worker leaders ready to go. But what’s also true is, the UAW workers are similar to those in West Virginia, where the teachers were building on a really strong culture where strikes existed for a long time. The women in West Virginia in the education workforce have fathers and grandfathers who struck the crap out of mines. When I interviewed some of the teachers, one of them said to me she went home and said to her father, “Yeah, we did it! We did a one-day strike!” And her father looked at her and said, “What the fuck is a one-day strike? If you go out, you go out!”
I think this is happening in the UAW strike. There’s ability for those workers right now to rely on the muscle memory of the history of the strikes in the auto sector. I think there’s a combination of things there: The top officials in the Auto Workers have zero credibility right now with the rank-and-file based on the unfolding scandal. And I think there are enough workers in the GM auto plant who either have been on strike or come from a family in that sector who have been on strike, or who are raised by parents or grandparents who have been on strike in the auto sector in some of those communities, that those workers are ingenious enough to try and pull this strike off and win. So yes, it’s flat wrong in my view that the workers were not involved in the contract campaign leading up to the strike, but it doesn’t mean they can’t succeed and win based on muscle memory that’s baked into most autoworkers in this country. They’re smart. They have family traditions. Those things get handed down through the family.
Also, they’re being buoyed. You’ve got New York Times columnists cheering them on; you’ve got the political elite cheering them on. And frighteningly, you can even see the idiotic, anti-union, anti-worker, anti–working class, racist White House trying to help them. It’s a pretty strategic moment, quite frankly, in a very strategic sector.
Under, let’s say, more ideal circumstances, you talk about the need for a supermajority participation to win. Can you talk a little bit about the work that’s involved in getting a supermajority of workers united for a cause, and explain the idea behind structure testing?
If you look at the Los Angeles teachers, they’re an example of what an excellent contract and strike preparation looks like. When you’re organizing toward a strike the way I was taught and the way I practice, and certainly the way we saw play out in Los Angeles and Chicago, you’re going into contract talks if you’re a trade unionist committed to rank-and-file involvement, to small-“d” democracy, you’re going to elect large committees, you’re going to elect a large contract action team, meaning workers themselves will elect their own representative, in large numbers, workplace by workplace, shift by shift, unit by unit, school by school if it’s in the education system. You’re going to elect a broad swath of the workforce that represents a broad set of classifications.
You would start off a good year in advance, having lots of conversations, running contract surveys. You’d be making sure that a majority of the workers filled in a contract survey and actually gave their opinion about what they want in the next contract. That’s step one, and you use the responses to then begin looking at where you’re strong and where you’re weak.
For me, the contract survey is the beginning of the structure test in a particular contract fight. It’s the first way to see how much engagement we have across the entire workforce. How many did we get back? Where are they coming from? How many workers are involved? What are their opinions? If you’re serious about building supermajorities, you want even your contract survey to come back from a supermajority of workers, and that doesn’t happen unless you make it happen. You have to construct the contract survey process in a deliberate fashion to engage the majority of workers. Most unions don’t do that. They just put out a survey and whatever comes back comes back. But people who are building toward a strike and understand the method of structure tests use the contract survey as a key structure test. And then you prioritize the areas where you had weak participation, and you’re going to build them strong. And the theory of doing a lot of structure tests is to build equal and supermajority participation across every work site.
So you start with a contract survey a good year in advance, at least, so that you’ve got the time to build where you might have low participation. You want to actively construct and build high participation, so that by the time you might get ready for something like a strike threat, it’s credible, it’s real. The one thing that’s important is no smart employer believes a bullshit strike threat—they see right through them. You don’t bullshit a smart employer about whether or not the workers are ready to strike. A smart employer knows whether or not the workers are ready to strike because they’re seeing the evidence inside the workplaces. Because the structure tests become public, right? You’re building the muscle leading up to a strike. So that’s what highly effective strike preparation looks like.
You’ve talked about the difference between organizing and mobilizing. To put it simply: Organizing is doing the hard work of getting just about everyone on board, even those who oppose the union, whereas mobilizing is merely rallying the people who already agree with you. You said, “I’m going to be going after the people who think they’re either anti-union or they’re undecided.” Do you have an example of people who are maybe even just afraid to participate, or disagree with the concept of organizing in this way, who are then persuaded to come along?
Every single fight I’ve ever been involved in, there’s a whole set of workers who are—first of all, the pressure’s intense with nurses and teachers. They love their students; they love the parents; they love their patients. They really don’t want to go on strike; they are not strike-happy people. They’re mission-driven. They understand they’re going to be causing some distress when they walk out. And so they have to have a vision that what they’re striking for is going to result in something much better for their patients and their students and the parents and the community, which is actually often true. There’s a lot of health care workers, for example, that I have worked with who feel close to their manager, who have a good working relationship, like with their line manager, who feel that this is something very bad to do initially, until they come to realize that there’s absolutely no way to overcome the crisis going on.
A particularly difficult example was Marne Payne, who was a worker leader, who was a tremendous nurse in a unit called telemetry in a hospital called Einstein in Philadelphia. She had a good relationship with her line manager and initially was completely resistant to the idea of forming a union, let alone the subsequent idea of getting ready for a strike vote. But I come from a tradition that says you have to build supermajority participation. We had made the decision that we could technically win the National Labor Relations Board elections without her unit, even though there were 66 nurses in it who weren’t talking to any of the workers who wanted the union. The decision was made to go forward and gamble. I’m like, okay, the numbers are there to win, but all along the conversation with the rest of the workers in the hospital was, “Look, after the victory, the first thing you’re gonna have to do is go recruit all the workers from the departments who were probably voting no.”
Sure enough, the day before the election in that hospital, April 10, in 2016, Marne Payne’s final postings were vote no, vote hell no—the union is the devil. She had been doing that throughout the entire organizing campaign, when many of her fellow nurses, obviously a majority of them, had a very different opinion. We set about the business of like, “Look, if you want to have a credible strike threat, you actually have to now go make breakthroughs in those big departments and recruit them in.” After four months of really sustained, really persistent conversations just in time for the contract campaign to begin, the workers won over Marne Payne. And when Marne came along, she brought 66 nurses from telemetry with her. And she went on, three months later, to lead the strike vote in her hospital. She went from full-on leading the anti-union campaign and then completely flipped and went on to lead the strike vote in their hospital, and they won a tremendous contract.
I have undying faith that most American workers want to fight, want to win, and want to make big change. And that’s part of why, despite the really problematic leadership at the UAW, I’m banking on these workers.
There’s this big climate action planned for tomorrow, globally. And it’s organized in large part by youth activists and students. They’re using the word “strike.” What does it mean that students are using that word?
I think it’s fine for students to call it a strike if, in fact, they’re striking, meaning they’re walking out and causing massive disruption of the educational process. I think it’s great. I had a strike in high school, too, and got suspended for three days. I think it’s a fine use of the word. I’ve been somewhat critical of the use of the word when we use it symbolically, among workers, but there have been massive student strikes, and I think they’re great. And if they’re closing down schools and shuttering facilities, I think that’s a great way for young people to raise the stakes and the debate about the climate crisis.
This last one, I suppose it’s obvious, but I would love to hear it in your words: What is so powerful about the collective withdrawal of labor?
Under capitalism, there really is no more powerful weapon for ordinary workers than if they can collectively walk off the job and interfere with the only thing the employer cares about. Which is not about their workers. It’s about making money. So, though many forms of protest are a good idea in general—I embrace a lot of forms of protest; I happily take part in lots of marches and protests for my entire life—but under the capitalist system, the employer cares really about only one thing, which is that workers show up, go to work, and continue making a profit for their employer. So when workers interrupt that process by having strikes at the level where either production ceases, in the case of a factory, like the UAW, or in the case of a hospital, where the employer has to replace a bunch of expensive workers to the tune of all of them and carry a double payroll when it’s done well in a health care strike, or in the case of the education sector, where every single educator walks off the job, hopefully, with teachers and bus drivers and cooks and everybody, and that causes an actual rupture in what we think of as the production process, even if the production is a service—all of those things directly create the kind of crisis that actually can force an employer to the negotiating table.
And that’s what this is about. This is about workers having the power to do something that yields results much faster than waiting for the 2020 presidential election. Workers can force a decision from an employer a hell of a lot more quickly about whether they’re gonna get $15, $20, or $29 if they can actually organize themselves into a massive supermajority structure and walk off the job. I’ve never seen a more effective way for workers to get results for themselves, their families, their communities than by a united coming-off-the-job.
Do you feel like we’re seeing a snowball effect? There was the start of this in Chicago in 2012, then 2018 struck and a litany of others have followed.
Absolutely. And again I think it’s because we’ve seen a series of well-thought-out, well-planned, really smart strikes, and people are winning. And when you’re at a level of misery that workers are at, and they begin to see, “Hey, these people just won. Why don’t we try that?”
As opposed to “Hey, let’s line up behind a compromised half-sold-out Democratic Party official who’s been promising us since 1947 that they’re going to do something for us.” And that’s how long the Democrats have been promising the American worker that they would fix broken labor law: 1947. The Democratic Party has literally been paying lip service that they would fix the broken labor laws since 1947, and ain’t a one president done it. Not one, Democrat or Republican. No one has, even when they had a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, from Jimmy Carter forward, not one of them fixed the problem. Not Jimmy Carter, not Bill Clinton, not Barack Obama. So hey, why not walk off the job and try to fix your own problem yourself?
Yeah. Otherwise you’re waiting forever, I guess.
Workers have lived and died in the generation that the Democratic Party’s been promising relief. And they haven’t seen it yet.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Well, according to Amanda Mull over at the Atlantic, it’s over. And what’s more, Americans pretty much always hated the thick-leaved green, even way back in the mid-2015s, when it was common to see bearded men out and about in “Eat More Kale” t-shirts.
Mull notes that Google searches for kale peaked in 2014, and sales began sliding in 2016. The formerly humble, now hipster Brussels sprout, meanwhile, is surging in search popularity, and is about to surpass kale. Adding insult to injury, Mull cites evidence that kale sales have “waned” at trendy New York City “desk salad” purveyor Sweetgreen.
Provocatively, Mull argues that Americans hated kale even when it was all the rage. She notes that Google searches for kale have for years spiked in January, when “America is ready to repent for the imagined sins of ‘enjoying food’ and ‘cooking things that taste good.'” In other words, kale only rose in popularity because it seemed virtuous; after confronting the reality of actually eating it, Americans decided it sucked. Here’s Mull:
Helen Rosner, the New Yorker’s food correspondent, raised her voice to second this analysis of kale in a Twitter thread, and add a twist: “Human bodies don’t like raw kale, which is why any kale recipe from before the kale boom involves either cooking it for-fucking-ever or, if it’s raw, pseudo-cooking it by slicing thinly, denaturing in a high-acid dressing, and physically massaging it to break it down further.”

Here’s the thing. Mull and Rosner are probably right that kale was never all that beloved, and that the boom involved “millions of people literally eating kale wrong and pretending to love the misery of their error,” as Rosner put it.
But I disagree that kale is an especially hard-to-love foodstuff. Plus, it isn’t unusual for ingredients to require a little prep before enjoyment. You can buy an apple or some strawberries, immediately bite into them, and have a great experience. Almost all other non-fruit ingredients, though, require some prep.
Beef steak, for instance: You wouldn’t bring one home and just bite into it. You’d be better off searing it medium-rare. If you love mushrooms, you know that they taste, at best, like cardboard when raw. Sautéed in a flavorful fat with garlic, they can be sublime. Asparagus? Raw, it’s okay, I guess, if it’s truly fresh. You’d still enjoy it much more lightly steamed and served with aioli, or roasted.
In other words, like most delicious things, kale improves dramatically with some kitchen doctoring. Does it require particularly skilled cooking? Does it need to be cooked “for-fucking-ever”? No, and no.
Let’s go back to much-maligned kale salad. For me it works best when you have a really fresh bunch of that long, skinny variety known as Lacinato or Tuscan, preferably picked in late fall, when it has endured a frost. That insult seems to amp up kale’s sweet and peppery qualities.
But really, you can make a decent salad with any old kale. I delivered a quick history of kale salad and a recipe for it here, during the height of the boom. Essentially, make (or buy) a flavorful dressing, shred or chop your kale, combine it all in a bowl, and give it a good massage with your bare hands, for less than a minute. If you’re too delicate to lay hands on shredded greens and vinaigrette, no worries. Just toss it thoroughly and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours or overnight— the oil in the dressing will break down the kale into something delicious.
All of that said, it’s perfectly wise to leave salad to delicate greens like lettuces and arugula, and reserve kale for quick braising. That’s where it really shines. Properly cooking kale is a lot like properly cooking most vegetables. Here goes (more detailed recipe here): Sauté a thinly sliced or chopped onion in olive oil until it’s translucent. Add some minced garlic and crushed red chili flakes, let it sizzle a bit. Then add thinly sliced kale and a splash of water or stock. Cover, and let simmer until you find it pleasantly tender, stirring occasionally. When it’s done to your liking—which will take a mere 10-20 minutes—remove the lid and let the excess liquid cook off. Season with salt and pepper, and you’ve got a wonderful, fairly simple dish.
From here, you can go in multiple directions. Add a splash of acid—lemon juice or vinegar—and hit it with a drizzle of olive oil, and dig into a great side dish. Fancy it up by transforming it into a rich gratin. Make it into a meal by incorporating it into a fast-and-simple fried rice. One of my go-to fast dinners is to toss a big batch of braised kale with whole wheat spaghetti and a can of chickpeas or white beans, and garnish with Parmesan cheese, toasted walnuts, and more olive oil.
So, sure: Maybe America never really did love kale, despite the boom, because people were cooking it wrong en masse. But cooking it right is neither difficult nor time-consuming. And done right, it’s really good. Just ask Helen Rosner. She actually fuckin loves the stuff.

On Sunday night, Trump paraphrased Robert Jeffress, a baptist-preacher-turned-Fox-News-pundit, tweeting: “If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.”

The online reactions to the tweet were far ranging. #CivilWar2 started trending. A Harvard Law professor claimed the tweet itself was grounds for impeachment. A Republican representative disavowed the tweet as “beyond repugnant.”
Meanwhile, a right-wing militia group called the Oath Keepers weighed in to agree with Trump.

The Oath Keepers describe themselves as an anti-government “patriot” group whose members pledge to uphold the constitution if a tyrannical president declares martial law. The group believes that day is imminent, and is constantly looking for evidence of a Deep state conspiracy to back their ideology. As Mother Jones reported back in 2010, the group consists largely of soldiers, police, and veterans, like Lee Pray, who runs training drills with fellow Oath Keepers to prepare for when that day inevitably comes:
With Trump in the Oval Office, the group’s longstanding antagonism toward the presidency appears to have waned; they’ve pivoted to viewing the president not as the perpetrator of Deep state collusion, but the victim.

But like so many others in the Trump era, this week is not normal.
The New York Times reported Monday afternoon that President Donald Trump pushed Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison “during a recent telephone call” to help prosecute his political vendetta against the people he thinks started the Trump-Russia investigation. That’s a big deal. Trump and other US officials, including Attorney General William Barr, appear to be trying to recruit all sorts of governments (Italy, the UK, and, of course, Ukraine) to do the same—and in some cases, they are covering their tracks by stashing unsavory conversations in a super-classified White House server.
Watchers of the far-right conspiracy machine know Australia plays a special role in sparking Trump’s anger. You might recall it was an Australian official, Alexander Downer, who sort of put this whole thing in motion. During a “night of heavy drinking” with Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos in a London bar in May 2016, Downer, Australia’s top diplomat in Britain at the time, learned some juicy gossip that the Aussies eventually passed onto the US: Papadopoulos had been told that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of her emails. That bar-chatter, when it reached Washington in July 2016, sparked the FBI investigation of the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia, which the following year morphed into the Mueller inquiry.
For some time now, Trump-defending conspiracy-mongers have assailed Downer as some kind of Clinton stooge, doing the bidding of dark, anti-Trump forces. That is, Downer, in cahoots with the Deep State, passed along this information to orchestrate the Russia probe in order prevent Trump from becoming president.
For Australians, this is hilarious: Downer is a lifelong soldier of conservative Australia, and happily so. He’s a former foreign minister in Australia’s conservative party, confusingly called the Liberal Party, and once led the party when it was in opposition. The thought of Downer in league with some kind of liberal, global deep state is fantastical enough to be instantly discounted. Nonetheless, in one example of how this disinformation was concocted and spread, The Hill ran a story in March 2018—co-bylined by John Solomon of whistleblower-complaint fame—highlighting Downer’s work to help end the scourge of HIV in the region. This effort, it reported, included awarding taxpayer money to the Clinton Foundation in 2006, and was painted as nefarious. Fox News picked it up. Papadopoulos himself has waged a long Twitter war against Downer:

Now, Trump has come knocking.
Prime Minister Morrison just last week stood in front of the White House beaming as the president lavished him with the pomp and ceremony of a rare official state visit, only the second of Trump’s presidency. Morrison praised the “amity” between the two countries; Trump, the “unwavering friendship.” It was the kind of diplomatic theater any Aussie PM relishes: wall-to-wall coverage back home, with enough red meat to keep Rupert Murdoch happy.
And it now appears that jolly commitment extends to doing Trump’s dirty work. Not long after the Times broke its story about the Trump-Morrison phone call, Australian reporter Kerrie Yaxley confirmed Morrison was fully onboard with Trump’s hijinks—and published the letter written by the Australian ambassador to the US, Joe Hockey, to Barr, pledging that “Australia will use its best endeavours [sic] to support your efforts in this matter.” Important to note here is the date: May 28, 2019, long before the “recent” phone call reported in the Times on Monday.

“While Australia’s former high commissioner to the United Kingdom, the Hon. Alexander Downer, is no longer employed by the government, we stand ready to provide you with all the relevant information to support your inquiries,” the letter reads.
Could it be possible that the Australian government will throw its stalwart party veteran and ally, Alexander Downer, under the bus to please Trump? It’s difficult to imagine. But no doubt we’ll learn more about what this US-Australian cooperation actually entails as the House Democrats’ push to impeach gathers speed.
In the meantime, Australia’s dedicated political press gang is busy piecing this timeline together in real time, while extracting information from a likely very stunned prime minister’s office.
Two bits of interesting coverage to point out immediately: Don’t miss BuzzFeed‘s attempt to extract the original intel outlining what Downer got from Papadopoulos in that London bar. (TL;DR: They weren’t successful in prizing the full document from the government, showing just how far the Australians will go to protect their relationship with the US.)

And finally, check out the interview Downer was forced to do on Australian radio on Monday, just as this news was breaking. He happened to be pre-booked this morning. Give that producer a raise.

“I want to turn to this whistleblower complaint, Mr. Secretary,” ABC’s Martha Raddatz said. “What do you know about those conversations?”
“So, you just gave me a report about an IC whistleblower complaint, none of which I’ve seen,” Pompeo responded with a chuckle, sidestepping her question. Instead, he repeats one of Trump’s misleading talking points on the Ukraine scandal. “I remember the previous administration was begged by the Ukrainian people to deliver defensive arms so that they could protect themselves from Vladimir Putin and Russia—and they gave them blankets.”
But Raddatz wasn’t having it. Clearly sensing evasion, she interrupted: “You say you know nothing about this. Let me ask you this question…Do you think it’s ‘perfectly fine’ to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent?”
“I think I saw a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister yesterday say there was no pressure applied in the course of the conversation,” Pompeo said. He then launched into an attack against the Biden family.
Let’s contrast that to what we learned this week: According to the WSJ, “Pompeo was among the administration officials who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president, a senior State Department official”—a crucial detail the secretary of state conveniently fails to mention in his September 22 interview.
On Tuesday, Pompeo announced that he’ll block State Department officials from testifying to Congress about the Ukraine call.

But let’s start with Bill Clinton. In 1998 Republicans impeached him for perjury but failed to get more than a tiny handful of Democratic votes in the Senate. They were punished for this at the polls later in the year.
Why? Clinton did lie under oath, after all. Everyone agreed about that. But outside of the fever swamps, among ordinary people, it mattered a lot what he lied about. And these ordinary people figured that (a) it was about getting a little nookie on the side, (b) it had nothing to do with his performance of his office, and (c) come on, everyone gets a little on the side and everyone lies about it if they get caught. Get real.
Republicans were in such a lather over Clinton that they just couldn’t get this, and it’s the same mistake Democrats made with Kavanaugh. Did Kavanaugh lie under oath? Of course he did. But outside the lefty Twitter mob it mattered a lot what he lied about. Most people understood that Kavanaugh had (a) engaged in some crude sexual behavior and binge drinking 35 years ago as a teenager, (b) it had nothing to do with the performance of his office, and (c) come on, lots of people are a little wild as teenagers and they all lie about it if they get caught.
Now, I know the lefty rejoinder perfectly well. Crude sexual behavior??? It was assault! It was rape! He ruined Christine Blasey Ford’s life. And then the smarmy prick tried to pretend he was the victim.
In the precincts of modern left Twitter, this stuff is so obvious that it hardly bears saying. Outside those precincts, however, it sounds head-shakingly ridiculous. Among Republicans, even honest ones, the whole thing looked like a cynically calculated attempt to destroy a good man who was guilty of nothing more than a trivial bit of youthful horseplay three decades in the past and had had a sterling career ever since.
I guess this is a long way of saying that I hope progressives don’t try to use Kavanaugh as a way of rallying the Democratic base. Like it or not, it will backfire. If Kavanaugh becomes a campaign talking point, ordinary people will just shake their heads and committed Republicans will be far more fired up to vote than Democrats. They are massively pissed about the whole affair. As always in politics, know your audience.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

See more editions and sign up here.
In a city where nearly 1 in 4 people live below the poverty line, Memphis’ biggest nonprofit hospital network had filed more than 8,300 lawsuits in five years to collect from patients who couldn’t pay. It even garnished the wages of more than 70 hospital employees for their own treatment.
An investigation exposed the hard-line bill-collection efforts, prompting the hospital network to discontinue its court collection process—and, last week, to erase the unpaid medical debts of more than 6,500 patients. The move followed widespread criticism of Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare by medical professionals, elected officials, and the United Methodist Church, which is affiliated with the network.
The collection efforts stood out as particularly aggressive to other nonprofit hospitals, which generally do not have to pay taxes in return for significant charity care and financial assistance.
Among the patients relieved of medical debt is Carrie Barrett, whose $12,019 bill for a heart catherization had ballooned to $33,000 as the hospital system piled on its attorneys’ fees, added interest seven times, and garnished her wages 15 times. Barrett, who has a part-time supermarket job, would have had to pay a court-ordered $100 a month for her two nights in the hospital until she was 90 years old.
Barrett got the good news that her bill was wiped clean two weeks ago from a court administrator, she told MLK50 Memphis, the local news site that investigated with ProPublica. “He said, ‘The balance is zero…I said, ‘You don’t know how good that sounds to my ears.’”
Barrett later stood up and made the announcement to her church congregation, which knew of her long struggle with the hospital.
“I just want to thank God for blessings that he has brought to me,” she shouted. “I thank him for the victory!” (MLK50 Memphis)

Over multiple attacks, the pair gunned down more than a dozen innocent civilians—people pumping gas, mowing the lawn, shopping, or reading on a park bench—leaving 10 dead and wounding others.
The random nature of the shootings, known as the Beltway sniper attacks, fueled anxiety around the region. Pedestrians changed their walking patterns out of fear of being targeted, and gas stations put up tarps to shield drivers filling their tanks. Police officers eventually arrested the shooters while they were asleep in their car, where law enforcement found binoculars, walkie-talkies, and a hole cut in the trunk to fire bullets through. Investigators tied the pair to at least 11 prior shootings from Washington state to Alabama. Muhammad was later executed, and Malvo was ordered to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Today, Malvo is a 34-year-old living out his term at a remote supermax in Virginia. He has said that he hopes his victims and their families can someday forget about him. But 17 years after the rampage, his case will get renewed attention next month at the Supreme Court: The younger Beltway sniper is now at the center of a debate about the ways teenagers are punished for crimes, and the extent to which states must give juvenile lifers—even those who committed notoriously violent offenses—an opportunity to show they have changed since youth.
If the court rules in Malvo’s favor, Virginia could be forced to resentence him. It is unlikely that he will ever be allowed out of prison, since he’s serving a total of 10 life sentences. But his case could offer a chance of release for about a dozen other Virginians who committed murders as teenagers. And depending how broad the Supreme Court’s decision is, it could pave the way for juvenile lifers elsewhere to petition for shorter sentences too, says Jody Kent Lavy, the executive director of the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth, which filed a brief supporting Malvo.
Malvo was born in 1985 in Kingston, Jamaica. His father moved away five years later, and his mother beat him regularly, according to court documents. At the age of 15, while he and his mom were living in Antigua, he met John Allen Muhammad, an African American Army veteran from Washington state who knew his mom. Muhammad had recently lost custody of his three children, and had fled with them to the island, where he made a living selling forged US identification documents. When Malvo’s mom moved to Florida, Malvo stayed behind and grew closer with Muhammad, who began introducing the boy as his own son. In 2001, Muhammad returned to the United States with Malvo, who briefly joined his mom in Florida, and a court returned Muhammad’s three kids to his ex-wife.
Malvo soon fled to Washington state to be with Muhammad, and they lived in a homeless shelter. Muhammad, furious with the courts for barring him from his own kids, began plotting a harebrained scheme to get them back by gunning down random civilians in order to try and convince the government to give him millions of dollars to create a utopia for black children. He trained Malvo to carry out the attacks, with daily shooting lessons at a gun range that sometimes lasted 12 hours. Malvo was so distressed he attempted suicide.
But after the pair carried out the crimes and were arrested, Malvo remained loyal. He tried to protect Muhammad by exaggerating his own role in the Beltway killings, falsely claiming that he pulled the trigger every time. He showed little remorse, laughing and pointing to his head as he described to investigators where a bullet hit a woman at a Home Depot in Virginia.
The United States is the only country where minors can legally be imprisoned for life without parole. For decades, courts in some states were even required to hand down this punishment to young people who committed serious crimes like murder. But in 2012, citing research on brain development, the Supreme Court ruled that mandatory life-without-parole sentences were unconstitutional for teenagers, who were still growing and possessed so much capacity for change. Even if a kid was convicted of homicide, the court ruled in Miller v. Alabama, a judge had to consider factors such as their maturity level and home environment when deciding a punishment. Four years later, the Supreme Court clarified that its ruling was retroactive, and that states would need to consider granting more than 2,000 juvenile lifers around the country new sentences. Life without parole, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, should be reserved for only the “rarest of juvenile offenders…whose crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility.”
But the state of Virginia has resisted resentencing Malvo. His attorneys argue that because his lack of maturity and rough childhood played a key role in his crimes, and because a court never took these factors into account, his punishment should be revisited.
By 2012, when the Supreme Court made its landmark ruling outlawing mandatory life-without-parole sentences for teens, Malvo had been imprisoned for a decade, and he’d begun to express regret for the horrific crimes. “I was a monster,” he told the Washington Post in an interview that year. An investigator told reporters he had been under Muhammad’s spell and was now more mature. “The spell was starting to wear off at trial, and now that he’s in jail for his entire life he’s probably being more realistic about what Muhammad did and didn’t do,” retired FBI agent Brad Garrett, who had questioned Malvo after the arrest, told the Post in 2012. “He’s older, and he understands now how impressionable he was.”
Since the Supreme Court rulings, more than 1,700 juvenile lifers nationally have had their sentences shortened, either by lower courts or state legislatures. More than 500 juvenile lifers have been released. But the state of Virginia argues that Malvo and about a dozen other juvenile lifers should not be resentenced because, like several hundred juvenile lifers nationally, they are serving discretionary sentences, not mandatory ones.
At the time of Malvo’s trial, Virginia required juries to hand down one of two punishments to anyone over the age of 16 who committed capital murder: the death penalty, or life without parole. Malvo’s attorneys argue that because the jury could not offer a shorter sentence, it did not actually have much choice. And they add that in any case, even if Malvo’s punishment was technically discretionary, he should still be resentenced because the court did not consider his age, lack of maturity, and home environment the first time around, nor did it consider whether any of these factors might warrant a lesser punishment. “Such a life-without-parole sentence violates Miller whether it is ‘mandatory’ or not,” they wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court.
The case, which the court will hear on October 16, could help resolve a disagreement among states about how to treat lifers serving discretionary sentences. In Virginia, a federal appeals court sided with Malvo last year, prompting the state to appeal to the Supreme Court. The state’s highest court ruled in a similar case that people with discretionary sentences should not be resentenced. Elsewhere, while a majority of states have moved away from life-without-parole punishments for teens, 15 states have filed an amicus brief siding with the state of Virginia in Malvo’s case.
Some advocates worry the notoriety and severity of Malvo’s crimes will work against him, and that the court, now stacked with more conservative members, could use the case to buck earlier trends of granting more leniency to juvenile offenders. But Malvo’s attorneys emphasize that the issue in front of the Supreme Court next month is not whether Malvo should ever be released from prison, but whether lower courts should be required to at least consider age and maturity levels while sentencing people who committed killings as teens. “Whether life without parole is the appropriate punishment for Malvo—taking into account his youth at the time of the crimes, his vulnerability to Muhammad, whom he thought of as his father, and his capacity for change—is potentially a thorny question,” his attorneys wrote in a brief to the court. “But it is not the question presented here.”
One of the dozen or so Virginia lifers whose future hangs in the balance is Holly Landry, who was 16 in 1996 when she and four others beat a man to death with a hammer during a robbery. Landry, who had no prior criminal record, said her accomplices threatened to hurt her if she didn’t help. (Her 35-year-old co-defendant, who testified against her for a reduced sentence, according to her attorneys, is set to be released in 2027.) A forensic psychologist at the time concluded she was immature for her age, and that neglect as a child made her susceptible to being pressured by her older co-defendants.
In the two decades since, Landry has earned her GED in prison, held a job, and started a support group for young offenders, even after developing multiple sclerosis. “Far from ensuring that only the rare, irreparably depraved minor is sentenced to imprisonment for life without parole, Virginia’s sentencing scheme has imposed that penalty in every case of which we are aware involving a juvenile convicted of capital murder,” her attorneys, one of whom also represents Malvo, wrote in court documents in her case. Landry, they added, “was not one of the ‘rare’ juvenile offenders for whom rehabilitation was impossible.” If the Supreme Court sides with Malvo, she could have an opportunity for a shorter sentence.
“The children who commit crimes like this, children who commit first-degree homicide, are almost always severely damaged children,” says Kathleen Wach, an attorney representing Derek Ray Jackson Jr., another juvenile lifer in Virginia. “People who are severely damaged do not deserve to be locked up for the rest of their lives. We owe it to them to look at what happened, to look at what brought them to this place, and devise a sentence that takes into account their situation.” Wach, who was raising her own kids in the DC area during the Beltway sniper attacks, says the shootings are still “seared into my memory.” But Malvo didn’t act alone, she says, and he was still just a teenager.
Last year, the judge who sided with Malvo was less sympathetic. But he wrote that the Supreme Court’s prior rulings left little doubt that children should not be sentenced as harshly as adults. “To be clear, the crimes committed by Malvo and John Muhammad were the most heinous, random acts of premeditated violence conceivable, destroying lives and families and terrorizing the entire Washington, D.C. metropolitan area for over six weeks,” Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote, barely stifling his own opinions about the case. “But Malvo was 17 years old when he committed the murders, and he now has the retroactive benefit of new constitutional rules that treat juveniles differently for sentencing. We make this ruling not with any satisfaction, but to sustain the law,” he continued. “As for Malvo, who knows but God how he will bear the future.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

“We will have no choice,” she told CNN late Monday on the inevitability of an impeachment investigation, as contemporaneous reports revealed the top Democrat spent the weekend discussing the issue with caucus leaders, including House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler.
The shift follows growing calls among Democrats, including moderate and first-term lawmakers once reluctant to throw in their lot with the “impeach this motherfucker” caucus, to begin the process after numerous reports revealed the president’s efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating debunked accusations of corruption into his 2020 rival, Joe Biden. Those efforts are reportedly the basis of a whistleblower’s complaint now at the center of a bitter showdown between Democrats and the Trump administration, as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has so far refused to reveal more information into the explosive complaint.
“If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense,” seven freshman Democrats wrote in the Washington Post on Monday. “We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and we call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of “inherent contempt” and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security.”
Trump has openly admitted to a July phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, during which the two leaders discussed Biden. After insisting that there was “no quid quo pro” raised in their conversation, Trump on Monday appeared to reverse course, hinting that he indeed may have threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine over his demands for a Biden probe.  “Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?” he told reporters at the United Nations General Assembly. Hours later, the Washington Post reported that the president directed his staff to withhold $391 million in the lead up to the now-infamous July phone call.
House Democrats are scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss impeachment.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), should be arrested for “treason.” The incendiary comment came amidst a flood of irate tweets by Trump Monday morning and as the president escalates his war with Schiff, who over the weekend signaled that testimony from the whistleblower whose complaint triggered impeachment proceedings against the president could be imminent.

Why is Trump floating the notion of Schiff getting arrested? Because in Schiff’s opening statement at last week’s hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, he parodied Trump’s efforts to push the Ukrainian president into launching an investigation into Joe Biden. “Shorn of its rambling character, and in not so many words, this is the essence of what the president communicates,” Schiff had noted at the top of the opening remarks, before going on to accurately characterize Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian leader.
In recent days, Trump has openly flirted with retaliating against his political enemies, including the whistleblower at the center of the Ukraine scandal. During one furious thread late Sunday, the president demanded to meet the whistleblower face to face and again suggested that the individual had improperly spied on him. The attack on the whistleblower came just days after Trump all but suggested that they should be executed.


Shortly after, Trump promoted a Fox News appearance from Texas megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress, during which Jeffress warned of a “civil war fracture” if Democrats successfully removed Trump from office. “This is beyond repugnant,” Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger responded on Twitter, yet another sign of dissent growing among Republicans over the president’s actions and behavior. Together, the late-night tweets offered a preview of the chaos that’s likely in store for the week ahead. His tweets Monday morning confirmed that yes, we’re in for a bumpy ride.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

John Bolton Says That Will “Never” Happen.,Dan Spinelli,MotherJones,Politics,"Twenty days after his firing as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton re-emerged onto the public stage, delivering remarks about North Korea that directly contradict his former boss’s pursuit of a grand bargain under which the Hermit Kingdom would give up its nuclear weapons. “The strategic decision Kim Jong Un is operating through is that he will do whatever he can to keep a deliverable nuclear weapons capability and to develop and enhance it further,” Bolton said.
This assessment contrasts markedly with Trump’s stated belief that Kim’s “great and beautiful vision for his country” will lead to a promising deal in which the North dismantles its nuclear weapons in exchange for relief from economic sanctions and closer diplomatic ties to the United States. Bolton, who once advocated preemptively bombing the rogue state, has viewed negotiations between the longtime adversaries skeptically.
The disparity between Bolton’s views and Trump’s was on sharp display during Bolton’s appearance Monday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. At the event, co-hosted by a South Korean newspaper, he spoke at length about the Korean Peninsula conflict, alluding at times to his reputation for holding views that are far more hawkish than those of the president. “I am delighted to be here today,” he said. “I’m also sure the leadership of North Korea is delighted that I’m here today in a private capacity.”
Bolton has long been a popular punching bag in the North Korean state press, which once referred to him as a “human defect.” Trump, too, ultimately grew tired of Bolton’s approach— specifically Bolton’s suggestion last year that US policy toward North Korea mirror the so-called “Libyan model,” a reference to dictator Moammar Qaddafi’s decision to relinquish Libya’s nuclear weapons program nearly two decades ago. In Bolton’s view, the credible threat of regime change following the 2003 US invasion of Iraq convinced Qaddafi to disarm. (Bolton helped craft the case for the invasion while working in the Bush State Department and still supports the Iraq war.) Kim did not appreciate that comparison—Qaddafi, of course, was later overthrown and killed during an Arab Spring revolution supported by the US—and the comment nearly sunk Trump’s early diplomacy with the North last year.
After joining Trump’s negotiating team for two summits with Kim last year, Bolton was banished to Mongolia on diplomatic business when Trump convened with Kim for a third meeting in late June. Two months later, Bolton was fired by tweet.
After his exit, Bolton assured reporters that he would “have my say in due course.” Monday’s event did not provide the Trump-specific details that Washington national security watchers might have been hoping for, but Bolton’s displeasure with his former boss was clear. When moderator Victor Cha, a former George W. Bush administration official, asked Bolton if “romance diplomacy” was the best way to get the North to denuclearize—a clear dig at Trump’s eyebrow-raising claim that he and Kim “fell in love,” Bolton didn’t take the bait. “I’m not going to comment on that,” he said. “Nice try.”
If his policy differences with Trump were not already apparent, Bolton left no doubt at other points in the discussion that he did not think Trump would ever be able to convince Kim to dismantle his nuclear program, which is now far more developed than Libya’s was when Qaddafi gave it up. Kim “may make some concessions, but under current circumstances, he will never give up the nuclear weapons voluntarily,” Bolton said.
Instead, Bolton argued, the Libya model—which Trump called a “disaster” after firing Bolton—could still bear fruit if the US produced the same variables that led to Qaddafi giving up his weapons: mainly, the threat of military action. “At that period, we saw Moammar Qaddafi make an unambiguous decision that he and Libya would be better off without developing nuclear weapons,” Bolton said, noting that the Libyan dictator arrived at that decision after seeing the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime and his capture by US forces. “Not only have we seen nothing like that from North Korea, we’ve seen the opposite.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Gavin Newsom on Friday.
Professional athletes such as LeBron James have supported the bill, saying professional endorsements fairly compensate college players for their work, the Los Angeles Times reported. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) however, has argued that the bill will unfairly benefit athletes in California over those in other states.
“It’s going to change college sports for the better by having now the interest finally of the athletes on par with the interests of the institution,” Newsom said on an episode of UNINTERRUPTED’S talk show The Shop, which was filmed on Friday and aired on Monday, according to the Los Angeles Times. “Now we are rebalancing that power.”
NCAA athletes are currently prohibited from profiting from their sports. Beginning in 2023, the bill, which was passed unanimously by California’s state legislature, will prohibit the NCAA from barring universities from competition if their players make money through endorsements.
The bill is a victory for college athletes who have been fighting for compensation despite pushback from the NCAA. The athletes affected by the bill include players for some of the wealthiest teams in the Pac-12 Conference: University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, Berkeley; Stanford University; and University of Southern California.

Ukrainian lawmakers said their government took these steps out of fear of upsetting Trump and jeopardizing a deal that would supply Ukraine Javelin anti-tank missiles for its ongoing conflict with Russia, which occupied portions of the country. In response to that story, several US senators, wondering if the investigations had been sidelined as an act of Trump-Ukraine collusion, requested information from the Ukrainian prosecutor. He did not cooperate and blew off their request. This is the same prosecutor who now happens to be in the middle of the latest scandal.
The Times article naturally raised suspicions. The four Ukrainian investigations that were frozen concerned Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chair, who had made millions in Ukraine as a consultant for the corrupt and ousted President Viktor Yanukovych and his political party. (Manafort is now in federal prison, convicted of tax fraud, money laundering, and other charges related to his endeavors in Ukraine.) And Ukrainian officials also let a key potential witness for Mueller—a Russian Ukrainian business partner of Manafort named Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI concluded was associated with Russian intelligence—leave Ukraine before Mueller’s investigators could question him. The reason for all this was obvious: “In every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials,” a member of Ukraine’s parliament told the Times. “We shouldn’t spoil relations with the administration.”
Three Democratic senators—Patrick Leahy, Dick Durbin, and Robert Menendez—quickly fired off a letter to Yuri Lutsenko, then Ukraine’s general prosecutor, expressing their “great concern about reports that your office has taken steps to impede cooperation” with Muller’s investigation. The letter asked Lutsenko to explain these moves. It also raised the issue of whether Trump and his crew had pushed the Ukrainians to quash these probes. “Did any individual from the Trump Administration, or anyone acting on its behalf, encourage Ukrainian government or law enforcement officials not to cooperate with the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller?” the lawmakers inquired. They also asked if there had been any discussion of the Mueller probe between Ukrainian and US officials when Trump met then-President Petro Poroshenko the previous year.
This was a serious matter. The senators were asking if there had been some underhanded collusion, a quid pro quo: missiles for blocking Mueller. Lutsenko did not answer their questions, according to a Menendez spokesperson.
Lutsenko has since gone on to become a key player in the Trump-Ukraine scandal. After meeting with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, early this year, Lutsenko began making allegations about the activities of Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine—unproven accusations that were seized upon by conservative media in the United States and that Trump and his defenders have used to distract from the July 25 phone call during which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked about buying more Javelin missiles and Trump leaned on him to produce negative information that Trump could use to discredit the Trump-Russia investigation and Biden. Lutsenko subsequently walked backed his claims. He recently told the Los Angeles Times that he has repeatedly rebuffed demands from Giuliani to provide dirt on the Bidens and that Lutsenko had seen no evidence that they engaged in any wrongdoing.
The unanswered letter sent by the senators to Lutsenko leaves a big hanging question: Did Trump in any way try to pressure the Ukraine government to impede Mueller a year before Trump phoned Zelensky and asked for this favor? No doubt, Lutsenko is already on a list of potential witnesses for the House Intelligence Committee investigation of Trump and Giuliani’s actions in Ukraine. If House investigators question him, the 2018 episode would be a natural topic in addition to his more recent interactions with Giuliani.
Meanwhile, Trump, in his up-is-down fashion, has tried to turn the senator’s letter into evidence that exonerates him. In a press conference last week, Trump declared it was really Democrats who had improperly threatened Zelensky. “They threatened him if he didn’t do things,” Trump said. He was apparently referring to a line in the note from the Democratic senators pointing out that blocking cooperation with Mueller “sends a worrying signal—to the Ukrainian people as well as the international community—about your government’s commitment broadly to support justice and the rule of law.”
Trump’s claim about the Democrats and the letter was false. He overlooked the key fact that Democrats sent this letter in May 2018, long before Zelensky’s defeat of Poroshenko in April 2019. They were not pressuring Zelensky. Nor was there any threat in the letter—just an obvious reminder that impeding these investigations would cause the international community to question the government’s commitment to lessening corruption, a critical issue for Ukraine, as it sought aid from Western nations.
But by referring to this letter, Trump did highlight an aspect of the Ukraine scandal that has not received much notice. In the complaint filed with the intelligence community’s inspector general, the whistleblower who kicked off this scandal contended that Trump’s call with Zelensky was part of a larger pattern of the president improperly bullying the former Soviet state. With Trump’s pressure on Zelensky now exposed, whether Trump and his allies also pushed Poroshenko for political help a year earlier is a more pressing matter.
“The Ukrainians were justifiably concerned that Trump would exact revenge by blocking security assistance if they did not act in his political favor,” Durbin, Menendez, and Leahy said in a statement last week. “It turns out that was truer than any of us could have imagined. Yes, we were worried that the President of the United States would abuse his office and leverage U.S. security assistance for his own personal agenda back in 2018. It looks like we were right then and we are right now.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Prosecutors allege her actions violate the state’s lewdness law; her lawyer argues the law unconstitutionally discriminates against women who are punished for going topless while men are not.
Tilli Buchanan and her husband were installing insulation in their garage when they shed their itchy clothing and stripped down to their underwear, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. When Buchanan’s stepchildren came into the garage and saw her topless, she said that they shouldn’t be embarrassed, because her husband—the children’s father—wasn’t wearing a shirt either.
The timing of the incident is unclear. Buchanan says it happened in fall 2016, but prosecutors say it was in November 2017 or January 2018.
The children’s mother, who was not present during the incident, reported it to authorities after the Division of Child and Family Services began an investigation about the children that was unrelated to Buchanan. As Jessica Miller writes for the Salt Lake Tribune:
Even though Buchanan was topless in the privacy of her own home, she is now facing potentially very serious consequences: three counts of lewdness involving a child, a class A misdemeanor which could land her in jail and place her on the sex offender registry for 10 years. Utah’s ordinance about lewdness involving a child prohibits the exposure of “the female breast below the top of the areola,” either in public or “in a private place under circumstances the person should know will likely cause affront or alarm or with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of the actor or the child.”
“Because Tilli Buchanan is a woman—and only because she is a woman—the state now seeks to condemn her as a child sex offender for engaging in the exact same non-sexual conduct as her lawfully faultless husband,” Buchanan’s attorney, Randy Richards, wrote in a motion to find the lewdness law unconstitutional, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. “Tilli Buchanan is being singled out for prosecution solely on the basis of sex.”
A 2019 Fort Collins, Colorado, ruling in the 10th US Circuit Court, which includes Utah, allows women to  bare their breasts in public. West Valley prosecutors say the court’s ruling does not override Utah’s state ordinance.
Buchanan is expected to appear in court on November 19.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) was expected to plead guilty to insider trading charges, the Daily Beast broke the news that Collins had resigned his seat on Monday. Several other outlets, including the Washington Post, confirmed that the four-term congressman had stepped down.
Collins’ departure from the House marks an inglorious end to his congressional tenure after three-and-a-half-terms representing a deep-red district in upstate New York. As one of the safest incumbents in the country, Collins drew notoriety in 2016 when he became one of the first sitting lawmakers—along with Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), another congressman facing a federal indictment—to endorse Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The early vote of confidence in the eventual Republican nominee won him loyalty and appreciation from Trump, who tweeted, “Chris, thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down!”
Within two years, Collins was fighting for his political life. In August 2018, he was indicted as part of an insider trading scheme involving an Australian drug company. As Mother Jones reported at the time:
He originally pleaded not guilty to charges of securities fraud and lying to the FBI, but the indictment all but halted donations to his campaign, halved his congressional staff, and made the race for New York’s deep-red 27th district suddenly competitive. (The Republican primary had already taken place, and New York’s arcane election rules made it close to impossible for the party to remove Collins.)
Collins defeated Nate McMurray, the little-known Democrat who ran against him, by less than 1,500 votes, ensuring he would return to the House as a pariah. Republican leaders stripped him of committee assignments and a coterie of primary opponents gathered to dethrone him. Even McMurray launched a second challenge last month, trashing Collins’ “many ethical and legal failures” in his announcement.
Within hours of the news that Collins had resigned, McMurray’s campaign released a statement reflecting the new political reality. “The real victims of Collins’ crimes are the people of his district that he repeatedly lied to about his guilt,” McMurray said. “Collins and Republican party insiders robbed his constituents of the representation they need on important issues like the rising cost of healthcare, the opioid epidemic, and the fight for good paying jobs.”
When Collins was arrested by the FBI last August, he called the charges against him “meritless” and vowed to “mount a vigorous defense in court to clear my name.” Thirteen months later, Collins “is expected to plead guilty to felony charges of insider trading,” the Daily Beast reported. On Monday, Collins notified Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) of his resignation “effective immediately.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

All true, I’m sure, but it misses perhaps the most important factor: Kool-Aid.
For the past 20 years Republicans have been drinking their own Kool-Aid. They believe that Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt politician of our era. They believe that Barack Obama engaged in a calculated campaign of illegal executive orders throughout his entire second term. They believe that Democrats secretly—or not so secretly—favor open borders with Mexico as a cynical ruse to increase the number of Democratic voters. They believe that progressives, if given power, will make it all but illegal to practice the Christian faith.
Against that backdrop, ask yourself this: is it really that big a deal to ask the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden? I mean, sure, maybe Trump shouldn’t have done it. But compared to everything Democrats have done—IRS targeting, Benghazi, emails, killing the filibuster, Kavanaugh, DACA, the list is just endless—it maybe rates a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10. It’s a trivial molehill that Democrats and their media enablers are trying to turn into a mountain.
And besides, even if Trump was a little over his skis in his conversation with Ukraine’s president, there really is a huge scandal surrounding Joe Biden. Right? Clearly the guy tried to call off the Ukrainian dogs in order to help his son make a ton of money, and used a billion dollars in taxpayer money to make his threat good.
Don’t just shake your head at this. Lots of Republicans believe it. And frankly, a lot of you probably believe equally crazy things about them. The big difference is that while some liberals may watch more MSNBC than is good for them, they also ingest other news that prevents them from going entirely over the edge. A great many conservatives don’t. It’s just Fox and Hannity and Breitbart 24/7.
So they stick with Trump. Some of them do it because they’re cynical and just want to hold onto power, but a lot of them do it because they aren’t cynical and truly believe Ukrainegate is a minor thing that wouldn’t rate a blurb on page A10 if a Democrat did it. They are entirely unaware that the narrative they hear on Fox is anything but the straight story. This is true of both Republican members of Congress as well as the rank and file.
The Kool-Aid is powerful. Don’t underestimate it. And don’t expect even smart Republicans to admit that it’s the real problem. Even the smart ones are afraid of it, after all.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Over at National Review, Charles Cooke says that while Ukrainegate may be bad, the Australia call is a nothingburger:
Come now indeed. The issue here isn’t that a legitimate investigation might just happen to produce findings favorable to Trump. That would be fine. But aside from the fact that this was never really a legitimate investigation to start with, we aren’t talking about Trump keeping himself at arm’s length and letting the chips fall where they may. We’re talking about Donald Trump explicitly getting on the phone to encourage an ally to help him.
By itself that may or may not be a big deal. But it sure shows a pattern of behavior, doesn’t it? If your goal is to make a case that Trump has been abusing the power and influence of the presidency to benefit himself personally, this is one more brick in the wall. Quite reasonably, I think that’s exactly how the public will see it.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The usual suspects are outraged:
I am terminally sick and tired of these groups. They have shown time and again that they simply don’t care about the evidence. All they seem to care about is that their reputations might suffer if they ever admitted that they had been wrong about something.
I date the start of the modern nutrition research frenzy to the Framingham study, which showed that saturated fat didn’t really have much effect on anything. However, in a portent of things to come, the public was somehow told exactly the opposite: that saturated fat was a deadly killer. It’s been downhill since: not just fat, but salt, cholesterol, eggs, palm oil, and nearly anything else you can think of spent the next 50 years in the barrel. It’s only in the last couple of decades that a few researchers have been brave enough to raise their hands and suggest that the evidence behind all this was crap.
In a way, there’s nothing wrong with that. Nutritional research is really hard, and it’s not surprising that a lot of it has turned out to be either wrong or at least questionable. But the nutrition community has never been satisfied to present their findings with the humility they deserve. They accept nothing less than the most apocalyptic interpretation of every study that even faintly supports their prior beliefs, and have shown virtually no willingness to accept new evidence that points in the other direction.
The plain fact is that we know squat about nutrition. Sure, you should eat a reasonably balanced diet and not do obviously stupid things—and for my money, I’d cut back on refined sugar.  Beyond that, listen to your doctor if you have a specific condition.
If you want to eliminate or cut back on meat for other reasons—animal welfare, climate change, etc.—that’s fine. It might even make you feel better. Who knows? But if you want to be healthier, I recommend brisk exercise daily and pretty much whatever diet you feel like stuffing into your gullet.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Farmers in the corn belt, the cluster of states centered on Iowa that produce the great bulk of corn and soybeans, supported Trump overwhelmingly in 2016, helping swing battleground states like Iowa and Wisconsin. But now many of them are furious, because the administration has been messing with one of the pillars of the region’s economy: the government-created market for corn-based ethanol. And that’s on top of a long-running trade war with China that has cut demand for the region’s two other main farm products, soybeans and pork.
The Renewable Fuels Standard, a policy passed into law under George W. Bush, compels oil refiners to mix 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol into the nation’s gasoline supply. Because of the law, ethanol makes up about 10 percent of the gas you pump into your car. For corn growers, who have been locked in a long cycle of chronic overproduction, the ethanol mandate is a lifeline: It provides a guaranteed market for about one-third of their annual corn crop.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump was happy to pander to farmers’ love of ethanol, even going so far as to declare the mandate should be raised above legislated levels. As recently as June, he visited an Iowa ethanol factory and effused about “clean, affordable, American ethanol” and claimed, falsely, that the zealously pro-ethanol Obama administration had “imposed radical restrictions on our farmers and ethanol production”:

But for oil refiners, the mandate is a headache: one that’s tolerable when oil prices are high, like they were in the aughts, but cumbersome when oil prices flounder, as they have been over the past decade. Of course, Trump is also quite tight with the oil industry. So the Trump administration has been playing a delicate game, trying to appease two powerful industries with conflicting aims.
Under the Renewable Fuels act, the EPA can waive the ethanol requirement for small oil refineries that can demonstrate that they’re in financial duress by having to add biofuel to the mix. While the refineries themselves must be small, the companies that own them don’t have to be. Exxon and Chevron have reportedly been among the oil firms that have sought exemptions. Last month, the EPA made a decision that favored Big Oil over Big Corn: it granted such waivers to 31 refineries, relieving them of the obligation to add biofuels like ethanol to their liquid fuel. According to Reuters, the Trump EPA has “more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refiners” compared to the Obama Administration.
Corn belt farmers have been furious with the administration ever since. In late August, Trump took to Twitter to suggest that he would make things right, promising goodies to both industries. “The Farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for Ethanol,” the president declared. “It will be a giant package, get ready!”

Since then, the administration has been silent about what the “giant package” will be, or when its details will be released, Jon Doggett, CEO of the National Corn Growers Association, told me. And as the wait draws out, farmers are losing patience with another burden imposed by the administration: the trade war with China.
While the trade war has caused grumbling since Trump launched it last year, the region’s growers endured it stoically, Doggett said. “While farmers were very concerned about the trade situation, they also wanted to see an improvement in how we trade with China,” he said. China had been a buyer of US soybeans for years, but it had generally avoided importing corn. “So a lot of farmers were saying, ‘let’s open up this market—we’re willing to take some tough times here,'” Doggett said. (It also probably didn’t hurt that Trump has lavished $28 billion in payments to farmers to offset trade-war losses—more than twice the price tag of the Obama administration’s 2009 auto-industry bailout.)
Then came the 31 waivers to oil refineries. “That was a game changer,” Doggett said. “I’m not seeing farmers suddenly turning on the president, but it certainly has made our discussions with farmers much different. As one of our board members said in our board meeting last week, ‘I’m willing to be a patriot; but I’m not willing to be a martyr.'”
Other industry players are venting in harsher terms. Kelly Nieuwenhuis, president of the board of Iowa ethanol maker Siouxland Energy, told Radio Iowa on Thursday that Trump’s “political future” in the state rides on his support for the corn-based car fuel. “When he made that call to grant those last 31 small refinery exemptions, you can’t believe how many upset farmers I was with that day that said they were done voting for President Trump,” Nieuwenhuis told the radio station. “That was the final straw.”
Meanwhile, the industry is still waiting to hear the details of that “giant package” promised by Trump. “The president just said that farmers are going to be ‘very happy,'” Doggett of the National Corn Growers Association said. “We’re definitely ready to hear more.” But the impeachment proceedings now embroiling the White House may delay the announcement indefinitely, he said. “Who knows when it will come out?  I’ve been around Washington a long enough time to learn to never try to forecast what an administration is going to do—particularly this one. “",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Miller called the whistleblower a “saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government” and invoked a far-right conspiracy line, saying that “this is a deep state operative, pure and simple.”
“A partisan hit job does not make you a whistleblower just because you go through the Whistleblower Protection Act,” Miller to host Chris Wallace said during a heated TV interview on Fox News Sunday.
Miller’s comments follow Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire’s testimony regarding the whistleblower complaint before the House Intelligence Committee last week.
In his testimony, Maguire defended his handling of the complaint. “I believe that the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout. I have every reason to believe that they have done everything by the book and follow the law,” he told lawmakers.
Miller’s accusations that the whistleblower is a member of the “deep state” echo popular conspiracy rhetoric on the internet that claims the entrenched careerist bureaucrats of America’s intelligence community are working to take down Trump.
The claim that there’s a cabal of so-called deep state actors across the federal government working to undermine the president has cropped repeatedly across the right-wing universe. Trump allies have casually used it as an excuse for difficulties Trump has had in advancing his agenda, and online conspiracy theorists have accused the deep state of helping to enable a supposed pedophile ring being run by liberal elites. There is no evidence to suggest any such group exists.
In the original complaint, the unnamed whistleblower said that in a July 25 call Trump tried to push Zelensky to launch an investigation into former Vice President and 2020 Presidential Candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

But Now It’s Under Threat.,Tom Philpott,MotherJones,Food,"A few weeks ago, I went back to school—literally, to the elementary school of my 1970s childhood in Austin, Texas. But I wasn’t (just) on a Proustian journey to recover the past. Instead, I went in search of something equally elusive: a free lunch. I had heard that Austin Independent School District’s Anneliese Tanner, the executive director of food services, was using administrative magic to serve high-quality, made-from-scratch meals to the district’s 80,000 kids, half of whom come from economically disadvantaged families. The kicker: At 82 of the district’s 129 schools—including my alma mater, Pecan Springs—the lunches are free for all children.
Take a trip to Pecan Springs, the elementary school Tom attended in the late 1970s, on the latest episode of Bite podcast:
When I arrived at the door of the midcentury brick building on a sunny Tuesday morning in early September, I was surprised to feel butterflies in my stomach—a throwback to my early-childhood terror of institutional settings that made the beginning of first grade a struggle. Then I had to check in at the principal’s office—where I was chastised in the fifth grade for participating in a conflict with the private school next door. More butterflies! All of that dissipated upon walking into the cafeteria. There, I was overcome, not with melancholic ruminations on my long-lost childhood, but rather by the joy and chaos of adorable first graders chowing down.
In a relatively quiet corner of the lunch room, I sat down with Tanner to try out the day’s fare: a toasty whole-wheat burrito featuring a mix of pureed beans and melted cheese; and a salad featuring crisp romaine, cherry tomatoes, black beans, corn, ground beef, and guacamole. The food was satisfying and fresh—nothing like the reheated square pizza chunks or pre-fab Salisbury steak I once wolfed down as fast as I could, so I could be excused to go roughhouse in the yard.
These days and in my childhood, the federal school lunch program confronts kids with a three-tiered price model based on family income level. Kids in households with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty line ($25,100 a year for a family of four) pay nothing; those in households with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of poverty pay $0.40; and all others pay $3.00. Not only does this form of lunch-room economic sorting risk embarrassing kids from low-income families; it also leads to mortifying cases of “lunch shaming,” where kids with past-due cafeteria bills can be stigmatized by being served off-menu cold cheese sandwiches and other punishments.
At Pecan Springs these days, all kids eat free—as is the case with about two-thirds of AISD schools, Tanner explained. Despite its status as a fast-growing, tech-centered city, Austin has pockets of hidden poverty, reflected in the high poverty rate of the student body. Using a little-discussed provision of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act—the school lunch reform law championed by then-First Lady Michelle Obama—Tanner made free lunch a reality for everyone in 82 of Austin’s 129 schools.
Under the provision, when at least 40 percent of students in a school qualify for free lunches, the school can claim “community eligibility”—meaning all students automatically have access to free lunches. The program eases the administrative burden for high-poverty districts, allowing them to shift resources from paperwork to better meals, Tanner said. She added that the community eligibility provision has been crucial to her push to ensure that every Austin school kid has access to a scratch-made healthy lunch.
Resources are tight—under federal reimbursement rates, Tanner has a little more than a dollar to spend on ingredients per meal. But in her schools with universal free lunch, she added, more kids queue up in the cafeteria and fewer kids opt to bring in bagged lunches. And higher participation rates mean more federal dollars and thus more buying power for high-quality ingredients.
The community eligibility provision is shaping up to be an underground path to providing universal free lunch for US school children, freeing them from the class humiliations of the three-tiered price model. Jennifer Gaddis, author of the soon-to-be-released The Labor of Lunch: Why We Need Real Food and Real Jobs in American Public Schools, argues that universally free, from-scratch lunches turns the school cafeteria into a vital community resource: one that helps kids develop healthy eating habits and provides skilled jobs for workers.
Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to deflate the community eligibility program. Back in 2016, a bill in the then-GOP controlled House of Representatives would have raised the poverty threshold from 40 percent of a school’s students to 60 percent, which would have forced 7,000 schools with nearly 3.4 million students to potentially fall out of the program.
That failed, but new Trump administration machinations could still damage the program. In July, the US Department of Agriculture proposed new rules that would knock 3 million people—including 500,000 kids—off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Kids whose families qualify for SNAP automatically qualify for free lunch, and count toward the 40 percent minimum needed for schools to qualify for universal free lunch. The administration is expected to release final rules in the coming weeks.
Pecan Springs, which has an economically disadvantaged rate of 94 percent, won’t likely see its free-lunch program imperiled if a few kids get booted from SNAP. But schools with rates near the 40 percent mark could, Crystal FitzSimons, director of school programs at the Food Research and Action Center, told me. She says it’s too early to tell how many schools, and how many kids, could be affected.
After sitting at my old school eating a flavorful, healthy lunch among first-graders, I’m convinced lunch should be free—from both price and stigma—for all kids.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Hill,MotherJones,Environment,"This story was originally published by The Bulletin of Atomic Sciences and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.
In advance of the UN Climate Summit this month, the Global Commission on Adaptation, chaired by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and former World Bank chief (now IMF chief) Kristalina Georgieva, released its first-ever report. Chock full of recommendations, the report urges increased action to accelerate adaption to climate change impacts. The Commission calls for what it termed “three revolutions for a better future”: improved understanding of climate risk, better planning, and rapid mobilization of finance.
But one thing is missing: any mention of judicial action as a means to accelerate adaptation. Courts can act as a powerful accelerant to flame the adaptation revolutions—particularly in the United States, with its robust independent court system based on precedent. Legal judgments can sharply motivate government agencies, business leaders, and professionals to rethink how they do business. A finding of criminal or civil liability can spur laggards in adaptive behavior to move more quickly. And improvements in the science of attribution—which focuses on determining how human-caused climate change alters the probability and magnitude of weather events—will add to the body of evidence supporting liability determinations. Given the law’s power to drive adaptation, climate litigation has the potential to advance the Commission’s goal of jump-starting the necessary transitions for change.
Recent surveys have identified climate-related lawsuits in at least 28 countries, with more than three-quarters of those filed in the United States. Up to now, lawsuits brought against fossil fuel companies have grabbed the lion’s share of media attention. To date, 14 cities, counties, as well as the state of Rhode Island have sued the fossil fuel giants in US courts. They claim the companies created what the law terms a “nuisance” by allowing the emission of greenhouse gases when they knew about the detrimental impacts of climate change.
Another set of cases catching the limelight were brought by children against the US government. The children claim that, by pursuing policies such as permitting drilling on public lands, the federal government has contributed to climate change. Those policies have, according to the children, denied their constitutional right to a safe climate. All of these cases have primarily focused on stopping future harm from carbon emissions; legal experts, scholars, and commentators have engaged in lively debates as to whether the lawsuits will prove successful.
So far, none has.
But another line of attack has begun to emerge, one that could drive greater adaptation. In those cases, litigants seek relief for the harm caused by failing to prepare for climate change impacts such as extreme precipitation, bigger wildfires, sea level rise, deeper droughts, and more extreme heat. And if those cases establish liability, they have the potential to drive even greater adaptation.
To determine liability involves the concept of negligence and the duty of care—one of the first lessons a law student learns. The basic idea is fairly straightforward: To help drive responsible behavior, the law imposes a duty of reasonable care to avoid foreseeable harm when performing acts that could injure others. When this duty is neglected, the law can require compensation for the harm caused. If the person acted recklessly, prosecuting authorities may even decide to treat it as a criminal matter. Under the common law system of precedent, a legal determination in one case can have a profound impact on future cases: It can shape, or even bind, future court decisions. In this manner, not only does an adverse judgment cause the defendants in the particular lawsuit to change their behavior, it can also motivate others to change their behavior as well, so as to avoid future liability. Consequently, legal findings of liability have the potential to influence future decisions on matters ranging from proper construction standards and land use practices to the protection of natural resources—in other words, the very choices that build climate resilience.
Growing harm from climate-fueled extreme weather will in all likelihood cause people to turn with greater frequency to the judicial system to seek recompense. Improvements in science may increase the likelihood of legal success. As scientists and others deepen their understanding of the contributions of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions to worsening climate impacts and enhance their ability to predict future extremes, what judges and juries find constitutes “reasonable care” will adjust. So too may the determination as to whether the harm caused was “foreseeable.” In this manner, litigation over liability can help drive adaptation like a bulldozer.
The principle that, as circumstances change, so does the standard of care is well-established under the law. A decision by Judge Learned Hand, one of the most celebrated jurists in the history of the United States, illustrates the point.
In March 1928, two tug boats set off from Norfolk, Virginia. They towed barges filled with coal bound for New York. When they left port, the weather was fair with no hint of a storm. Neither tug boat, however, carried a radio to receive weather reports. The tugs pulled the barges northward along the coast without incident. But, as they passed Atlantic City, the wind began to pick up. Not long after, gale force winds started to blow, making the barges unwieldy, and eventually they sank. A lawsuit followed, alleging that the owners of the tugboats and barges had failed to exercise reasonable care. When the defendants appealed, Judge Hand concluded that they had not.
Finding the barge owners liable was easy: The barges were not seaworthy, leaked badly, and could not withstand a coastal March gale. But the tug owners were a different matter. Their liability turned on the failure to carry a radio on board the tugs. With radios, the tug boat captains would have received weather warnings, warnings that would have caused them to seek shelter from the storm. The tug boat owners claimed that they had no duty to provide such radios because they were not standard equipment in the industry. Judge Hand rejected the argument. He observed that typically what is commonly done is reasonable—but, in some cases, a whole industry may have lagged in making changes. He said that standard practice alone cannot decide the duty of care. In some instances, “there are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission.” The principle that Judge Hand articulated close to a century ago may prove prescient for climate litigation.
As climate change impacts inflict more damage, governments, professionals, and business may find themselves liable for relying on historical standards of practice that fail to account for increasing risks.
A case in Chicago illustrates how this might unfold. Illinois Farmers Insurance Company filed a class-action lawsuit in 2014 on behalf of its policyholders after heavy rains led to wide-spread flooding. It sought damages from some 200 local agencies and municipalities, claiming that they had failed to take adequate precautions to manage storm water in the face of extreme precipitation from climate change. Illinois Farmers alleged that the defendants relied on obsolete rainfall frequency tables that did not reflect the increased risk. Although the company withdrew the case before it got to trial for reasons unrelated to the case’s merits, the legal action served as a warning shot of how widespread liability could be when alleging a breach of the duty of care to prepare for climate impacts. In the face of growing damage from new climate-driven extremes, future defendants could include not only the owners and operators of infrastructure, but also the contractors, sub-contractors, engineers, surveyors, architects, and anyone else a lawyer may think of.
Bottom line: Like the tug-boat owners, the argument that they followed standard practice may not prove an adequate defense.
Another emerging area of civil liability focuses on the duty of care owed by officers and directors to their companies and shareholders. In 2018, the insurance giant AIG predicted that directors and officers of a company may face liability for breaching the duty of care or failing to meet due diligence requirements if they fail to properly consider and disclose foreseeable climate risk. The consulting and accounting firm of EY published a report for its clients, warning of the risk of director liability for failing to consider climate risks. The report carried the provocative title, “Do you understand your duty of care and diligence when it comes to climate-related risks?”
And in August of this year, shareholders of Exxon Mobil Corp sued the officers and directors of the company claiming, among other things, that they had breached their fiduciary duty when they failed to accurately assess the risk that climate change posed to the company.
Further support for expanding officer and director liability came earlier this summer, when the Delaware Supreme Court—one of the most influential courts in the United States for corporate law—found that the directors of a company could be liable for failing to have in place a reasonable board-level system of monitoring and reporting risk. The decision spurred corporate lawyers to recommend that boards of directors review carefully their processes and procedures with regard to monitoring significant risks. Directors who fail to fulfill this duty may be found personally liable.
In addition to civil liability, some defendants could face criminal liability for failing to plan for climate risks. In Florida, inadequate backup power in the wake of Hurricane Irma in 2017 led to the filing of criminal charges in August 2019 when 12 patients died at a nursing home. At the conclusion of the most extensive criminal investigation ever conducted in Broward County’s history, prosecutors brought murder charges against four staff members of the Rehabilitation Center of Hollywood Hills nursing home. Extensive power outages had caused air conditioning to fail and temperatures to soar in the facility. Patients began to die in the oppressive heat; some had temperatures as high as 109.9 degrees. An administrative law judge recommended revoking the facility’s license, finding that because the nursing home lacked sufficient backup cooling capacity to deal with the loss of power, it had failed to provide a safe environment. He wrote in his opinion that “ultimately the patients were dependent on Hollywood Hills to recognize the danger and keep them safe.”
One of the questions that arises in climate litigation is whether anthropogenic climate change contributed to the severity of particular events, events like extreme flooding in Houston or deeper droughts in California. The science of attribution can provide answers to these questions. The field has grown over the last several decades with climate scientists have conducting numerous studies to determine whether climate change contributed to various extreme events. For example, scientists have concluded that Hurricane Maria was almost five times more likely to happen in the climate of 2017 than in the climate of 1956. As the science improves, legal experts have opined that it may alter the duty of care by changing the foreseeability of future climate-exacerbated extremes. Attribution science could support a determination that a corporation, a professional, or a government agency breached their duty of care to avoid foreseeable harm. According to the Grantham Institute, litigants have already reportedly drawn on this science in cases against governments for failure to adapt or adequately prepare for extreme events.
Courts can assist in creating the necessary revolutions envisioned by the Global Commission on Adaptation. Judicial findings of negligence have the potential to drive professionals, business leaders, and government agencies to make better decisions about preparing for climate risks. Adverse judgments can motivate them to consider more closely anticipated climate change impacts in their decision-making. Court dockets have already begun to bulge with cases seeking relief from harm caused by climate change. The use of climate change litigation as a tool to drive climate action will continue.
And, as the impacts accelerate, the advice of one climate expert may prove particularly apt: “If I were to advise my children about what career to go into related to climate change, I would say: ‘Be a lawyer.’ ”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Smith,MotherJones,Environment,"This story was originally published by High Country News and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.
This summer, the Yurok Tribe declared rights of personhood for the Klamath River—likely the first to do so for a river in North America. A concept previously restricted to humans (and corporations), “rights of personhood” means, most simply, that an individual or entity has rights, and they’re now being extended to nonhumans. The Yurok’s resolution, passed by the tribal council in May, comes during another difficult season for the Klamath; over the past few years, low water flows have caused high rates of disease in salmon, and cancelled fishing seasons.
With the declaration, the Yurok Tribe joins other Indigenous communities in a growing Rights of Nature movement aimed at protecting the environment. Last year, the White Earth Band of Ojibwe adopted the Rights of Manoomin to protect wild rice—manoomin—and the freshwater sources it needs to survive in Minnesota. And in 2017, the New Zealand government adopted the Rights of the Whanganui River, stemming from a treaty process with Māori iwis, or tribes, that gives the river its own legal standing in court. “By granting the rights of personhood to the Klamath River, not only does it create laws and legal advocacy routes, but it’s also an expression of Yurok values,” says Geneva Thompson, associate general counsel for the tribe and citizen of the Cherokee Nation, who worked on the resolution. “The idea is that the laws of a nation are an expression of the nation’s values.”
The Yurok resolution draws inspiration from the Rights of Manoomin, as well as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, which enshrines the right of Indigenous people to conserve and protect their lands and resources. Legal personhood provides a different framework for dealing with problems like pollution, drought and climate change, though no case has yet been brought to put the Whanganui, Manoomin or Klamath rights to the test in court. The crucial aspect to establishing these legal frameworks, Indigenous lawyers say, involves shifting relationships and codifying Indigenous knowledge—in other words, recognizing non-human entities not as resources, but as rights-holders.
“From New Zealand to Colombia, the powerful idea that nature has rights is taking root in legal systems,” says David Boyd, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, of the Yurok Tribe’s resolution. “We must no longer view the natural world as a mere warehouse of commodities for humans to exploit, but rather a remarkable community to which we belong and to whom we owe responsibilities.”
In essence, the Yurok resolution means that if the river is harmed, a case can be made in Yurok tribal court to remedy the problem. Currently, says Yurok Tribe General Counsel Amy Cordalis, laws like the Clean Water or Endangered Species acts can be used to protect rivers by addressing symptoms of problems like diseased fish or pollution. But the Yurok resolution seeks to address the river’s problems directly and holistically, including the impacts of climate change. “You’re working towards making the river whole again,” Cordalis says.
In December 2018, the White Earth Band of Ojibwe and the 1855 Treaty Authority, an organization that upholds treaty rights for Chippewa bands, established legal personhood for wild rice. The resolution draws from the Rights of Nature—an international concept that argues that nature should have the same rights as humans—and is the first law to recognize legal rights of plant species. The rights spell out that within White Earth and other Chippewa ceded territories, wild rice has “inherent rights to restoration, recovery and preservation,” including “the right to pure water and freshwater habitat,” the right to a healthy climate and “a natural environment free from human cause global warming.” Frank Bibeau, executive director of the 1855 Treaty Authority and a White Earth tribal member, says the rights are an extension of Ojibwe treaty rights both on and off the reservation. And they may soon be put to the test—the proposed crude oil Enbridge Line 3 pipeline, which requires state approval, would cross into off-reservation areas where manoomin and freshwater sources are.
The resolutions give tribal nations new legal strategies for use in court, especially in regards to climate change: “The idea of having legal avenues to address the harms of climate change is an important next step as legal systems adapt to the climate crisis,” says Thompson at the Yurok Tribe. And they also encourage a change in mindset, says Maia Wikaira, an environmental law attorney who worked with the Yurok Tribe’s legal team, and a member of the Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Te Rarawa and Ngāpuhi tribes of New Zealand. As tribal nations establish rights for nonhumans, it creates an opportunity for states to follow suit, and incorporate the concept into their own court systems. “It’s another example of where long-held Indigenous perspectives and association with the natural world are not only being embedded within our legal system—they’re being seen in popular environmental movements as an innovative way forward and a necessary step,” Wikaira says. “So, old is new again.”
Rights of nature have already been established in Colombia, Ecuador and India, with varying success, and have also appeared in non-Native communities in the U.S. In Ohio this February, voters passed a law—which is already being challenged—granting Lake Erie personhood rights. An attempt in 2017 by Coloradoans to force the state to grant the Colorado River rights of personhood collapsed after the state threatened possible sanctions against the lawyer behind the case.
Now, Thompson says, the relationship between the Yurok Tribe and the Klamath River is reflected in the tribe’s law. “It shifts the conversation, and it shifts the value system, because you see the environment has a right to be clean and protected for the environments sake.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The poll, which was published on Sunday morning, found that 55 percent of the survey participants supported an impeachment inquiry. Of those, 35 percent said they strongly support it and 20 percent said they somewhat approve. Forty-five percent disapproved of an inquiry; 31 percent of which said they strongly disapprove and 14 percent said they somewhat disapprove.
The results are largely split along party affiliation. The survey found that 87 percent of Democratic respondents approve of starting an impeachment inquiry, while 77 percent of Republican respondents disapprove
Forty-two percent, a plurality of the survey’s respondents, believed that Trump deserves to be impeached over what’s already been revealed about his dealing with Ukraine. Thirty-six percent disagree and 22 percent believe its too early to say. The survey polled 2,059 participants on Sept. 26 and 27 and had a 2.3 percent margin of error, according to CBS and YouGov.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, following a growing tide of Democrats warming to pursuing impeachment— a pursuit that more progressive lawmakers have long advocated for.
Trump has faced increased scrutiny over the past week due to whistleblower allegations that in the president’s July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump used his position to “solicit interference from a foreign government in the 2020 U.S. election,” when Trump asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","Joe Biden’s presidential campaign is reportedly asking television news executives to not book Rudy Guiliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, on their channels.
The Biden campaign sent out an unusual letter on Sunday morning addressed to top TV news executives and prominent anchors. The letter, written by two top Biden advisers, said Guiliani’s repeated spread of disinformation about Biden and his son Hunter should disqualify him from appearing on their networks, according to The Daily Beast.
“We are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump. While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,” the letter reportedly says.
“We write to demand that in service to the facts, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative,” they added.
The letter goes on to make the case that Guiliani “is not a public official, and holds no public office that would entitle him to opine on the nation’s airwaves.” The campaign also requested that “an equivalent amount of time … to a surrogate for the Biden campaign” in segments where Guiliani is scheduled to appear.
Guiliani disparaged the letter as “ left-wing censorship,” in a comment to The Daily Beast.
Brian Stelter, a media reporter at CNN, tweeted that ABC’s “This Week” and “Face the Nation” on CBS were offered a Biden campaign surrogate today, though according to a Biden campaign source,  both shows declined. Still, Stelter pointed out that the Biden campaign has been largely unavailable in the run-up to primary season compared to other campaigns.

The Daily Beast reported that the letter was sent to all major network heads including NBC President Noah Oppenheim, CBS News President Susan Zirinsky and CNN President Jeff Zucker, along with hosts like CNN’s Jake Tapper, NBC’s Chuck Todd, and Fox News’ Chris Wallace.
In recent days, Guiliani has consistently repeated debunked claims about the work of Biden’s son, Hunter, in Ukraine and Joe Biden’s efforts to remove a prosecutor there. Trump’s personal lawyer has tried to position Biden’s criticisms of the Ukranian prosecutor as a corrupt attempt to protect his son. Meanwhile, Guiliani has failed to mention that the prosecutor was facing global pressure to step down and was not handling the then-dormant case in the country that involved Biden’s son.
“Your obligation is to provide the American people with an informed, fact-based and responsible,“ the Biden campaign letter reads. “Rudy Giuliani has made very clear that his only obligation is to protect Donald Trump, and that he will willingly lie to do so.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In a new report, The New York Times investigated how technology companies and the government are failing to keep what it calls a “criminal underworld” of disturbing, explicit child pornography from spiraling out of control. Last year, tech companies reported finding a record 45 million online photos and videos of the abuse more than twice the volume of what they found the year prior.
As the internet has expanded, so has the availability of content that depicts children, some of whom are only three or four years old, being tortured and abused.
Similar content has always been a problem online, just not on this level; a decade ago, the reported number of photos and videos found in a year was only around one million.
Law enforcement agencies assigned to tackle the problem say they are understaffed and underfunded, but technology companies that have done more to enable the spread of horrific and tragic content than they have to stop it are at the heart of the problem.
Hany Farid, a professor of digital analytics at the University of California-Berkeley, worked with Microsoft to develop technology in 2009 to detect child sexual abuse material. Farid told the Times that tech companies have been hesitant to dig into the issue.
The story is a familiar one for technology companies. Egregious, exploitative content proliferates on their platforms and the companies are often slow to take action. Versions of this have played out over the last several years with hate groups, terrorist groups and other types of abusive and damaging content. Often, if resolution comes, it’s only after public outcry.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Giuliani, who joined President Donald Trump’s legal team a few weeks later, was at this gathering because, Giuliani says, his security firm agreed in 2017 to help the city improve its emergency services and seek foreign investment.
But the deal had a murkier element. Giuliani later conceded that he wasn’t just working for Kharkiv and that for at least some of the work he was paid by Pavel Fuks, a Kharkiv-born business executive who became a prominent real estate developer in Moscow in the 2000s and who has said that he negotiated directly with Trump between 2004 and 2010 about building a Trump-branded tower in Moscow. Fuks was one of several Ukrainians with Russian ties whose attendance at Trump’s presidential inauguration was investigated by former special counsel Robert Mueller. So at the start of Trump’s presidency, Giuliani was hobnobbing with at least one Ukrainian player who would be tainted by scandal.
Giuliani’s dealings in Ukraine exploded into public view this month, with the revelation that Trump pressured the country’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to work with Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and information to discredit Mueller’s probe. A complaint filed by an intelligence community whistleblower that triggered this new Trump scandal depicted Giuliani as a Trump henchman prowling Ukraine for negative material Trump could use against Biden. But the former New York mayor’s involvement in Ukraine and other former Soviet bloc countries has been more extensive and even more sketchy than these disclosures indicate.
The New York meeting and an earlier trip Giuliani trip took to Kharkiv in November 2017 were arranged by TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, the firm says on its website. TriGlobal, which claims to have offices in New York, Moscow, and Kiev, sells itself as an international business consultancy that does public relations work for clients in Russia and Ukraine. The firm also brags that it has worked with Giuliani since 2004, arranging trips for him to former Soviet states. Last October, Giuliani took a break from his work representing Trump to speak about cybersecurity at a conference TriGlobal organized in Armenia to promote a Russia-led economic bloc, the Eurasian Economic Union. Giuliani appeared at the event alongside a Russian official, Sergey Glazyev, who was sanctioned in March 2014 for his role in the annexation of Crimea and who has been accused of advancing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Ukraine, an accusation he’s denied. Giuliani was reportedly invited to a conference by Russian Armenian multimillionaire Ara Abramyan, a member of TriGlobal’s board, who reportedly suggested at the time that he expected Giuliani to deliver a message for him to Trump.
On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Giuliani planned to participate in a panel led by Glazyev at the same conference in Armenia this year. Giuliani canceled his plans to attend after the Post‘s report. He said he decided not to attend after learning that Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to go. “If Putin’s going it’s easy,” he said in a text.
These gigs form part of Giuliani’s lucrative post-mayoral career as a roving international security consultant and high-priced lawyer. That career has continued, even after Trump brought Giuliani onto his personal legal team with a mandate to take a combative approach against Mueller’s investigation. Giuliani provides not only pro-bono legal assistance for Trump, but, he says, political advice, and reportedly he acts as somewhat of a personal emissary for the president. All the while, Giuliani has shrugged off questions of whether clients, including foreign interests, are paying him and his firm as he functions as Trump’s consigliere. And he has refused to comprehensively identify his clients. He claims that he does not need to register as a foreign agent with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act—which would require him to disclose details of his work for overseas clients—because he does no lobbying in the United States for foreign entities and instead merely provides security advice to any client he has abroad.
But at least one former client disputes Giuliani’s claims about his work. “I would call him the lobbyist for Kharkiv and Ukraine—this is stated in the contract,” Fuks told the New York Times in March. “It is very important for me that such person as Giuliani tells people that we are a good country, that people can do business with us. That’s what we would like to bring to America’s leaders.” Neither Giuliani nor Fuks has made their contract public. Giuliani has declined to say what he and his firm were paid for the work.
Seven Senate Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), pressed the Justice Department this week to investigate whether Giuliani is violating foreign lobbying law. “Like any other American, Mr. Giuliani has legal obligations to report his work on behalf of foreign clients,” they wrote, “and the Department of Justice should not give him preferential treatment or exempt him from his obligation just because he is the President’s personal attorney.”
Giuliani conducted other business in Ukraine while working for Kharkiv and Fuks. In June 2017, Giuliani traveled to Kiev where he reportedly met with then-President Petro Poroshenko, Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko, and other government officials. Giuliani also spoke on “democracy” and the “rule of law” at a conference organized by the foundation of Ukrainian metals magnate, Victor Pinchuk—an oligarch whose 2016 payment of $150,000 to Trump’s charitable foundation drew scrutiny from Mueller. Giuliani, who in 2006 reported receiving up to $200,000 per speech, has declined to say how much he he was paid for that presentation. It’s unclear if these activities had any connection to Giuliani’s deal with Fuks and Kharkiv.
In a text message Thursday, Giuliani said his work in Ukraine in 2017 was unrelated to his recently revealed activity. “My business in Ukraine ended in Dec. 2017,” he wrote. But Giuliani’s involvement in the country continued after he became Trump’s lawyer in April 2018.
In May 2018, Ukrainian officials stopped investigating payments to Trump’s former campaign chair Paul Manafort and dropped an offer to assist with Mueller’s prosecution of him. Ukrainian officials told the New York Times they feared helping Mueller would anger Trump, potentially complicating their purchase from the United States of antitank weapons aimed at deterring Russian aggression. This week Giuliani insisted in a text message to me that he did “not know anything about” that move.
At some point in 2018—the exact date is unclear—Giuliani began working on Ukraine-related matters with two Soviet-born American business executives, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. Giuliani has said they’re his clients, though his work for them appears indistinguishable from his efforts on Trump’s behalf. In a text message on Monday, Giuliani declined to comment on this work, citing attorney-client privilege. Parnas and Fruman did not respond to inquiries.
According to a joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, it was Parnas and Fruman who first encouraged Giuliani’s effort to dig up dirt on Biden. Both Parnas and Fruman, who live in South Florida, became big GOP donors in 2018, giving at least $576,500 in combined donations over several months. They used the resulting access to powerful Republican figures to promote a plan to sell American liquified gas to Ukraine. In May 2018, the duo dined with the president at the Trump International Hotel and had breakfast in Beverly Hills with Donald Trump Jr. and Tommy Hicks Jr., who later became co-chair of the Republican National Committee, according Facebook posts by Parnas, which he later deleted. It is unclear if Giuliani was helped connect them with Trump.
According to the OCCRP/BuzzFeed News report, Parnas and Fruman organized a late 2018 Skype call between Giuliani and Viktor Shokin, the prosecutor whose firing was pushed by Biden and many European diplomats in 2016. Shokin was ousted for blocking anti-corruption probes, but Giuliani and Trump have asserted that Biden sought Shokin’s dismissal to protect his son, Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, from investigation. There is no evidence to support that claim.
But Shokin, not surprisingly, was apparently eager to help smear Biden. Parnas claims that he and Fruman put Giuliani in touch with Shokin’s replacement, Yuriy Lutsenko, late last year. Giuliani and Lutsenko met in New York in January 2018 and in Poland in February, according to the OCCRP/BuzzFeed News report. Giuliani told the Washington Post that he has met with five current and former Ukrainian prosecutors overall, including Shokin and Lutsenko, since last year.
Shortly after their get-togethers, Lutsenko and Giuliani began pushing allegations in the US media about Biden and claiming Ukrainian officials interfered in the 2016 election to help the Hillary Clinton campaign. Many of these claims ended up in articles written by Hill opinion writer John Solomon, whose reports were amplified by Fox News and other conservative media and by Trump—but his reports have largely been debunked. Ukrainian anti-corruption activists claim Shokin and Lutsenko were promoting phony accusations, and Lutsenko later withdrew many of his claims. Daria Kaleniuk, the head of a Ukrainian anti-corruption group, contends that Lutsenko issued allegations to please Trump in a bid to keep his job.
“I was investigating, going back to last year, complaints that the Ukrainian people, several people in Ukraine, knew about a tremendous amount of collusion between Ukrainian officials, and Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic National Committee,” Giuliani claimed last week on CNN. These accusations promoted by Giuliani have been embraced by Trump’s Justice Department and Attorney General William Barr. On Wednesday, the Justice Department said that a probe initiated by Barr and run by a US attorney, John Durham, is “exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.” (The nature of this probe is unclear. Ukraine was not involved in the initiation of the FBI’s investigation of the Russian attack on the 2016 election and the interactions between the Trump campaign and Russia.)
According to the Washington Post, since Zelensky took office in May, Giuliani has sidelined the State Department and helped force the firing of the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whom he accused, seemingly without evidence, of “collusion” and of “working for” liberal financier George Soros. Trump’s request that Zelensky help Giuliani unearth negative information on Biden has received lots of attention. Zelensky agreeing to do so has received less notice. According to the whistleblower’s complaint, Giuliani met with a Zelenksy adviser on August 2 in Madrid to follow up on “cases” discussed in the July 25 phone call.
Giuliani’s role, particularly his work in Ukraine in 2017 and 2018, has not been fully explained. The whistleblower complaint alleges that Giuliani has been “a central figure” in Trump’s covert effort to use his power to press Ukraine to help tilt the 2020 election in his favor. An unnamed US official quoted by the Post made a similar claim: “Rudy—he did all of this,” the official said. “This shitshow that we’re in—it’s him injecting himself into the process.”
Asked about his work in Ukraine, Giuliani, in a series of texts, called the issue “bull distraction.” Not enough is publicly known yet to back up Giuliani’s this-is-a-distraction defense, or to assess whether Giuliani’s actions in Ukraine will ultimately help Trump or cause him more difficulty in a scandal that has led to an impeachment inquiry.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

When a major new study on North American bird populations appeared in the journal Science last week, it included all the trappings of a typical scientific paper, along with one, less conventional addition: The study also came with its own hashtag, #BringBirdsBack.
Certainly, the central finding of the research team, led by Ken Rosenberg, a conservation scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, seemed likely to trigger strong public reaction, on and off social media. Since 1970, the researchers estimated, the North American bird population had declined by roughly 2.9 billion birds, a 29 percent drop. It was, the researchers wrote, “an overlooked biodiversity crisis.”
The finding received widespread media coverage. “Where Have All the Birds Gone?” a headline in The Seattle Times asked. A piece in Vox wondered whether the trend would end in a “bird apocalypse.” (Not necessarily, the piece conceded.) And the headline on a front-page story in The New York Times declared that “Birds Are Vanishing From North America.” The dramatic opening line of the piece: “The skies are emptying out.”
Researchers affiliated with the Cornell team even managed to land an accompanying op-ed essay in The Times the very same day. “The Crisis for Birds,” the headline opined, “Is a Crisis for Us All.”
The declines were certainly notable, but some ecologists have begun to question whether the calculus undertaken in the paper truly warranted this sort of language, and the ominous future it seemed to suggest. And those concerns have raised further questions among some scientists—and even some reflection among authors of the paper themselves—about how high-stakes research, the constraints of high-profile journal publishing, and sophisticated publicity can sometimes combine to drive a story into the news cycle while eclipsing important uncertainties, and perhaps even delivering an incomplete message to the public.
Rosenberg’s team analyzed bird population monitoring data for more than 500 species of birds in the continental United States and Canada. Ten years of data from sophisticated weather radars, which pick up the movements of migratory birds, offered additional support. The researchers found that many bird species had made significant gains in population over the past five decades. But many more had experienced losses, yielding a net population loss of between 2.7 and 3.1 billion birds, centered around an estimated total of 2.9 billion.
“It was kind of a shocking result to us,” Rosenberg told Undark.
The researchers recognized that their paper would draw considerable public attention, and they also began thinking about how to publicize the result. “You know, as scientists we don’t normally do that,” Rosenberg said. “But because the authors of the paper represented multiple organizations that were already active in bird conservation”—Rosenberg himself has a joint appointment with the American Bird Conservancy, a nonprofit organization based in Virginia — “this coalition formed right away.” The researchers, he said, realized “okay, this is going to be big, and we have to be ready for it. We have to use this as a springboard for messaging.”
The research team was able to develop an unusually sophisticated media strategy. “What’s different is that this time we had the professional communicators right there with the professional scientists, and just a phenomenal team of people who understand media and communication,” he said. “Plus, being lucky enough to publish this in Science, they have their own media machine.”
About a month before the paper was published, the American Bird Conservancy registered the webpage domain name 3billionbirds.org, using a memorable figure from the higher end of the study’s 2.7-3.1 billion-bird confidence interval. When the paper was published last Thursday, the website was ready, with a hashtag, a YouTube video, summaries of the paper, a media resource center, and a downloadable document outlining actions people can take to help birds. The site loads with a flashy, marquee animation of a western meadowlark disintegrating into thin air.
Cornell provided a media package that included b-roll for TV stations and formatted-for-Instagram illustrations of startling stats from the paper. The study’s title, “Decline of the North American Avifauna,” was chosen in part, Rosenberg said, because it echoes the phrase “decline of the Roman Empire.”
Some people have told Rosenberg that, upon seeing some of the graphics the team had prepared, they began to cry. “It’s pretty phenomenal,” Rosenberg said of the public response. “We’re a bunch of bird nerds. We don’t see this kind of global reaction to this kind of news.”
As public attention to the study has intensified, though, not all ecologists are convinced that the numbers in the news actually present such a clear-cut picture. In a post on the academic blog Dynamic Ecology, Brian McGill, a macroecologist at the University of Maine, praised the study, even as he questioned whether the data actually pointed to an impending bird apocalypse.
In the post, McGill observes that, of the 2.9 billion birds lost, many belong to species that are not native to North America. Just two of those species—the European Starling and the House Sparrow—account for close to 15 percent of the net population loss recorded by the researchers. “The irony is that land managers and conservation agencies have actually spent a lot of money to try to drive down or eliminate invasive species,” McGill said in an interview with Undark.
McGill also argues that, for many other species—especially those that thrive on farmland—population numbers may have actually been inflated in 1970, a result of generations of forest clearance and prairie destruction. By that reckoning, some of the decline may not be a catastrophic drop, but simply a return to an earlier baseline population that precedes the arrival of Europeans.
When I brought up these issues with Rosenberg, who had not yet read McGill’s post, he agreed that they were important considerations. “Those are very good points, and you can dive-in many, many different ways into nuances that we were not able to cover in the paper itself,” he said, adding that “we had to cut out 90 percent of what we wanted to say.”
The paper does briefly mention that it includes non-native species, and, Rosenberg said, the research team debated whether to include invasive species in the total.
In his Dynamic Ecology post, McGill also observes that the species that account for most of the 3 billion figure, whether native or not, are mostly among the most abundant bird species on the continent. While that loss in biomass is concerning, he argues, it does not necessarily suggest a looming extinction event.
Todd Arnold, a conservation biologist at the University of the Minnesota who studies bird population dynamics, made a similar point. “If you take away the 40 biggest decliners from the dataset, then what’s left behind is hundreds of birds, some of which are declining, some of which are increasing. But, on average, the increases outweigh the declines,” Arnold said.
Many of those birds in the top 40 decliners, he continued, should absolutely signal concern. But, he said, “that’s not apocalyptic. It’s saying that, you know, between 5 and 10 percent of our avifauna is in serious trouble,” he added. “That’s a serious message. It’s maybe not quite ‘Decline of the North American Avifauna.’”
A slightly different framing of the exact same data, Arnold continued, could have yielded an accurate, more nuanced story—but then it also would have been less likely to earn a place in what is arguably the world’s most prominent science journal, and all the predictable publicity that came with it. “I’m pretty sure if I tried with the same analysis, and focused on the fact that I could do a really cool and sophisticated analysis based on 500-plus species, that would never get past the editor’s eye,” he said. “It would have ended up somewhere. But certainly not in Science.”
When they set out to publish a paper, researchers have to balance competing demands. Along with the desire to publish good science, they are often vying for a coveted slot in a top journal. And when placing a paper in a top journal, such as Nature or Science, some scientists have complained, it helps to have a paper that will garner media attention. It also tends to come with some space limitations, McGill suggested. “They were in a Science magazine format, which gives you about three pages, and so not a lot of room to get into nuance,” he said of the Cornell researchers. “And I think they did acknowledge and raise several of the issues that I raised.
“I mean, we could go back and have a conversation about scientists, whether it serves our careers well to get into high-profile journal like that … ” he added. “You can’t really have a nuanced conversation in those places.”
For researchers whose work has implications for policy and conservation, there are added considerations about how they should convey the urgency of their findings, and about how their work will reach the public and, perhaps, policymakers.
Rosenberg said that the research team had been divided on how exactly to convey their findings. Some members of the team, he said, had actually hesitated to use the word “crisis.” Others had objected to the word “collapse.” (The final paper does use the word “crisis,” and it refers to the “potential collapse” of bird populations.)
Certainly, some of the media package graphics produced as part of the study’s promotional roll-out seemed to emphasize drama over detail. In one graph, posted on a Cornell Lab of Ornithology blog, a population line plunges nearly to the x-axis, seeming to imply a coming mass extinction—a finding that is not supported by this dataset, and that does not reflect the actual claims of the paper.
To some, these kinds of images may represent a clear, internet-friendly way to communicate a serious conservation issue. To others, they may run the risk of appearing sensationalist—or of helping to feed coverage that takes on apocalyptic overtones. McGill said the reception of the avifauna paper reminded him of “insectageddon”—a series of high-profile studies on insect population decline that sparked headlines worldwide, but that also came under scrutiny from biologists who argued that the findings had been dramatically overstated.
Manu Saunders, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of New England in Australia who studies ecology and insect populations, and a prominent critic of the insect armageddon narrative, made a similar point. “I think that the bird apocalypse wouldn’t have been such a big deal in the media if the insect apocalypse hadn’t happened,” she said. Much of the hype around an impending insect disaster, Saunders said, grew from media relations professionals at universities who took otherwise solid studies and misrepresented their conclusions in press releases. She’s concerned that the insect collapse hype has built a sensationalized “framing narrative” that is shaping the way both scientists and the media report on population changes in a variety of species.
McGill said he fears that this sort of dramatic coverage can, in time, lead the public to trust scientists less. “The scientists never claimed that it’s leading to a mass extinction, the scientists never claimed that it’s leading to a complete depopulation of birds,” he said of last week’s Science study, “but that’s what [people will] remember the scientists saying, 15 or 20 years from now.”
“That’s not what’s really happening,” he added. “I think it hurts the credibility of scientists.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

A crowd of several dozen people, many of them teenagers, converged at the oil giant’s global headquarters, heeding a call from local student group Youth vs. Apocalypse to rally against the company for contributing to climate change and allegedly polluting low-income communities of color in the region.
Bearing signs with slogans like “The Dinosaurs Thought They Had Time Too,” young people participating in the latest Friday climate strike led adults in chants imploring Chevron to defund fossil fuels and expand its investments in renewable energy. At some point, their message reached the ears of some of Chevron’s higher-ups, who came out of their offices to meet four students from Youth vs. Apocalypse on a patch of grass just inside the gate.

First opened in 1902, the Chevron Richmond Refinery, not far from San Ramon, has had a number of major accidents in the last few decades. A “huge explosion” in 1999 sent hundreds of local residents rushing to hospitals as the facility emitted noxious fumes. Another major fire in 2012 caused 11,000 people in the wider East Bay region to seek treatment, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Activists claim that the oil refining process emits airborne toxins year round, while Chevron and some local legislators maintain that the facility is safe. The Richmond refinery has been fined twice in recent years for air quality violations.
Cemre Gonen, a seventeen-year-old San Ramon resident, felt some anxiety as she approached the suits, but the feeling soon dissolved because “I know what I’m talking about and who I’m fighting for,” Gonen tells Mother Jones. “We agreed on some things, like that climate change was real and renewable energy is what we need to focus on.” Yet Gonen says they disagreed on the point of whether nearby communities, such as those living near the refinery in Richmond—a city where 20 percent of residents are African American and 40 percent are Latino—were being harmed by the company’s activities.
In 2012, Scientific American, drawing on California Department of Health statistics and a study by the University of California–Santa Cruz, reported that Richmond residents had higher rates of cancer than people in nearby cities, and were 1.5 times more likely to go to the emergency room for asthma attacks compared to their county’s average. According to Gonen, the Chevron reps said that these health disparities were purely a result of socioeconomic reasons with no proof the refinery was to blame. Gonen said their response “perpetuates environmental racism and classism.”
Mari Rose Taruc, an Oakland resident who’s worked with groups like the Clean Energy Alliance for twenty-five years, said she came to support youth in taking aim at the “world headquarters of destruction.” She cited not only her fears about the refinery, but also Chevron’s outsize contributions to greenhouse gas emissions, and its sustained lobbying against state regulations. Asked what Chevron could do to improve, Taruc replied, “there is no room in the future for fossil fuel companies like Chevron.”
In a statement, Chevron said it supports “open and honest dialogue,” is actively considering “energy transition and climate issues,” and is already investing in “low carbon business opportunities.” The statement added that the Richmond refinery recently underwent a modernization project that continues to reduce its emissions.
A 2017 report by the Carbon Disclosure Project ranked Chevron and its products as one of the world’s top 20 contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. This year, the Sacramento Bee reported that the company spent more on lobbying in California than any other group, particularly targeting a bill that aimed to require all cars sold in the state to be emissions-free by 2040.
Youth vs. Apocalypse had an even bolder vision, demanding that Chevron completely cease its use of fossil fuels by 2025. Gonen says that the corporate representatives “agreed that things need to change,” but told her that “historically, change happens slowly, and we need time”—but “we don’t have time,” says Gonen. “They need to be changing right now.” She was not convinced by their appeal to oil’s economic benefits. “If we don’t have a planet, who cares about profit?”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Donald Trump’s was terrible. His envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, stepped down. Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada became the first Republican member of Congress to come out in support of an impeachment inquiry. And the Washington Post reported on another bombshell meeting with a head of state—a 2017 meeting in which Trump told two senior Russian officials “that he was unconcerned” with their country’s interference in the 2016 election.
So, as he prepared for a nice soothing round of golf on Saturday morning with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, the leader of the most powerful country on Earth sent three tweets in quick succession—”PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!” (8:34 a.m.); “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” (8:35 a.m.); “KEEP AMERICA GREAT!” (8:35 a.m.). You can always count on him to play the hits.
But first, he typed out this:

That’s the president of the United States referring to his political opponents—including four women of color he’s previously suggested don’t belong in this country—as “savages.” Trump has spent most of his presidency deploying dehumanizing language against people, or groups of people, he wants his political base to hate: Mexicans, Muslims, residents of Baltimore, homeless people. So at a certain point the phrase “this isn’t normal” starts to lose meaning. This is disturbingly normal; it’s maybe the last song he still plays.

You’ve heard about this meeting before, because it was a big deal at the time—that’s the same one where he revealed classified information to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. As with many weird and scandalous things the president does, it momentarily dominated the political discussion and then sort of faded away.
But the meeting has taken on new significance in the wake of the whistleblower complaint about Trump’s phone call with the president of Ukraine. The complaint alleged—and the administration subsequently confirmed—that the White House had taken unusual steps afterward to “lock down” the details of the call, by storing it on a separate classified server and restricting access. (Another Friday report by CNN shed more light on the White House’s attempts to shield several of Trump’s sensitive calls from the public’s eye.)
Per the Post:
As with seemingly everything having to do with Trump, there are really two different layers of scandal here. One is the suppression of records. That’s not a small deal—it is a subject of the impeachment investigation, after all. But the other is a very large one: The Post story catches the president explicitly telling the hostile power that attacked his political rival and interfered with the cornerstone of American democracy that is was all totally fine with him.

	Politics","This story was originally published by Newsweek and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.
The vast majority of scientists agree climate change is an existing, growing, and human-made threat to our planet. And yet the topic is a divisive issue in the US—not least among people of faith.
White evangelical Christians in particular are, on average, more likely to question whether human activity contributed to the Earth’s warming, with research by Pew suggesting 28 percent accept this view, compared with 64 percent of those without a religious affiliation, 56 percent of black Protestants and 41 percent of mainline Protestants. Over a third of evangelical Christians say there is “no solid evidence” that climate change is happening.
Some evangelicals argue that global warming is of little concern when the end times are approaching. Indeed, it could even be proof of it.
Bible verses are also pointed to as evidence humans are required to subdue Earth, that God is in control, and global warming is part of His plan. Others see it as liberal hoax and a means to push folks away from religion towards the government.
But that’s not the whole picture. As author Katharine K. Wilkinson explores in her book Between God & Green: How Evangelicals Are Cultivating a Middle Ground on Climate Change, a subset of evangelicals are concerned about the environment, and are actively campaigning to protect it. By looking at the intersection of religion and politics, Wilkinson, found members of what is known as the ‘care movement’ believe humans are custodians of the planet—and it is our duty to protect God’s creation.
Wilkinson was inspired by the 2006 Evangelical Climate Initiative campaign, where American evangelical church leaders called for a market based approach to tackling climate change. Between 2007 and 2009, she spoke to leaders and grassroots members of the movement, held focus groups, and sat down with a range of congregations.
Due to be released in October, academic Robin Veldman offers a sequel to Wilkinson’s work in her book The Gospel of Climate Skepticism: Why Evangelical Christians Oppose Action on Climate Change. Using a similar approach to Wilkinson in her research, the assistant professor of Religious Studies at Texas A&M University charts how the movement evolved since 2011.
Newsweek spoke to the researchers about what their work suggests shapes the Evangelical view on climate change, the risk involved with speaking out, and how attitudes have evolved.
Can you briefly define what you mean by evangelicals in this context?
There’s a lot of debate over what the term means and how best to measure it. My book focuses on traditionalist evangelicals, who are a subset of the broader evangelical community, one that is mostly white and both theologically and politically conservative. When defining evangelicalism more broadly, I use the same definition that Katherine uses, and it’s the same one that the National Association of Evangelicals uses.
Katharine Wilkinson: We’re talking about theologically conservative Christians. There’s often a lot of overlap with politically conservative folks. But those two things are different. There is so much difference between theologically conservative white Christians and other theologically conservative Christians, oftentimes.
I totally agree. There are groups like Jehovah’s Witnesses that are theologically conservative, but they’re not evangelicals. So yeah, evangelicalism is being theologically conservative, but also there’s an evangelical subculture and certain cultural winds blow through that community that don’t touch other theologically conservative communities.
What are the most important factors which shape how evangelicals view climate change? For instance, those who believe it’s their duty to protect protect God’s creation, those who think humans can do with the Earth as they please, and those who don’t think protecting the environment matters because the end times are approaching.
KW: Often, I found that there was kind of a much larger group of people who would say things like, “we agree, we’re called to care for God’s creation,” or “we’re called to be stewards of the planet.” But that didn’t necessarily map directly on to: “And so we should do something about climate change.”
Even where you had a theological or religiously grounded support for the idea of being a good steward of creation or the environment, there’s a lot of other stuff that surrounds the topic of climate in particular. In my experience, the biggest thing that would otherwise chop kind of good ecological theology off at the neck was generally political ideology.
I was doing these focus groups shortly after An Inconvenient Truth (2006) came out. There were a lot of Al Gore associations with climate change and the sense that this is part of a part of a broader progressive agenda. Even at that time, I think the sort of partisan baggage around and around the climate was already quite strong.
RV: I did mine in 2011, 2012. So, five years later. It’s funny that Al Gore did come up a lot in my focus groups as well. He’s a polarizing figure.
What I traced out in the book is how politics and religion became sort of fused together. And that starting around probably 2007 and 2008, there was this campaign that leaders in the Christian Right initiated to portray scepticism that the climate is changing due to human activities as the more biblical position on climate change.
Evangelical Christians uniformly believe that they should care for the environment and be good stewards. But for them that was really disconnected from concern about climate change. And I think that politics has a lot to do with it. When you look at how the surveys change over time, Evangelicals—from the earliest surveys I can find were [from 2004]—already more skeptical than the general public. But that gap started increasing, and that may be due to the efforts to portray skepticism as the more Biblically sound approach to climate change.
Since you brought up end times, the question that inspired my research was whether end time beliefs were responsible for environmental apathy, because a lot of environmentalists bring that up. And I concluded—and some evangelical environmentalists I’ve seen quoted saying the same thing, like [reverend] Jim Ball does—that end time beliefs are certainly powerful within the evangelical world, but there hasn’t really been a conscious effort to connect them to environmental issues.
So it’s not a driver of apathy—except for maybe among a small segment, but these people also tend to be very politically disengaged anyway, because if you think the world’s going to end, then you’re not going to go out and be politically involved.
What I saw at least was the tension between theological conservatism and political conservatism that’s been developing over time, especially taking off in the 1980s and into the present.
That drive for Christians to get out to vote, return to public life, and reclaim America. A lot of the people that I talked believe that America used to be a Christian nation, or should be a Christian nation. So they feel that becoming politically active is part of their mission to reclaim what was lost. And that was, from what I saw, a more powerful driver than end time beliefs.
KW: I agree. Somehow that trope became really popular among progressives and environmentalists.
RN: It was [journalist and political commentator] Bill Moyers. I think.
KW: I think it’s incredibly unhelpful, not just because it does not seem to be the primary driver, but also, where do you go from there? I think it’s a dangerous oversimplification.
Because climate change has become so entwined with politics, is it dangerous or socially risky for some evangelicals to speak about climate change?
RV: I saw a lot of evidence of that. Part of being a part of the evangelical community is showing that you keep good theologically conservative company, and environmentalism is associated with being liberal. In America, theological liberalism and political liberalism are kind of viewed as the same thing. So it does raise questions if you become interested in the environment.
It’s not to say that people never can, because there’s totally examples like the Young Evangelicals for Climate Action. It’s not you’re going to be excommunicated. In my context, people talked about global warming as more of a punchline. It was like, “oh, haha, that’s what liberals believe in.” If you hear people making those kinds of statements, then you’re not likely to bring it up in a serious context, because it just subtly communicates that this isn’t a serious issue.
KW: I think that’s an interesting way to put it: that there is a social risk. This is not just a set of beliefs that you are holding as an individual. Oftentimes, it’s a set of a set of beliefs that you’re holding, and practicing in a community. Whether that’s in a church community or beyond.
I think there were certainly leaders in the evangelical community who I wrote about in Between God and Green who had some very real backlash from the power brokers on the evangelical right.
Robin makes a good point about Young Evangelicals for Climate Action. If you look at self-identified Democrats or self-identified progressives in the US, there’s not much of an age gap around climate change. Twenty somethings and 60 somethings look very similar. But if you look at folks who are self-identified Republicans, or politically conservative, there is a distinct age gap between 20 somethings and 60 somethings. And this is where Young Evangelicals for Climate Action is playing strategically. We also have some good research that shows that people’s children are the most effective messengers on climate change, especially daughters of conservative fathers. So they’re going right for that age gap with the most powerful messenger, and leveraging: “Look you taught us X, Y, and Z, in church, growing up and from the Bible, thus this what we think about climate change,” which I think is really fascinating.
The other thing I thought was interesting … Megan Mayhew Bergman, who writes for The Guardian, did a series of pieces about the South and climate change, and she found some interesting kind of gender gap stuff. You’re talking about male leadership, often patriarchal leadership in a lot of evangelical churches, and women not feeling like they necessarily have the space to speak up and say something that might contradict their pastor.
RV: There is a paper called Cool Dudes that talks about why climate change scepticism is such a white male phenomenon. I was just trying to think back over my focus group: I had a lot of outspoken women. But I’m not sure about about gender dynamics. I heard them being sceptical as well.
When you talk about the backlash, what do you mean?
KW: When I was looking at this topic, there was more high profile evangelical leadership engaged visibly and loudly on the topic. I think it was quite significant when Richard Cizik was ousted from the National Association of Evangelicals. He was the chief lobbyist for the National Association of Evangelicals in DC. He did an interview with Terry Gross on NPR. He insinuated that he had voted for Obama, and he said something to the effect of “I’m coming around on gay marriage.”
RV: Picking up on what Katherine said, in 2006, the Evangelical Climate Initiative came out. And one of the reasons people were really excited about it was because at that time there was a lot of concern about climate change at the grass tops, but there wasn’t a grassroots movement.
The idea was that evangelicals were going to add to the momentum that was already building. Since they were politically conservative, they were going to make it undeniable that action needed to be taken.
Evangelicals were like this political prize to be won. People who were affiliated with The Evangelical Environmental Network—one of the main evangelical organizations working at the national level—had been slowly trying to move climate change from the left to the centre. They wanted to shift it to the middle, to become a centrist concern.
This was of concern to people in what I call the Christian Right, or the evangelical right, who are a group of leaders, usually heads of major media ministries—a lot of them have been active in politically conservative circles. One of their complaints was that: this is dividing evangelicals’ political clout. And if evangelicals break in half, then we won’t be able to make progress on the issues that we’re more concerned about, like religious liberty, and sexual morality. And that was one reason why they criticize Richards Cizik for taking a stand on climate change.
There’s an interesting report from Lydia Bean and Steve Teles in the New America Foundationthat talks about how they were closely in touch with economic conservatives and the Republican party. At the same time as much as environmentalists were super excited that evangelicals might be coming on board, the other side had this whole group of people opposing action on climate change pushing as hard as they could against it.
Moving on to 2006, 2007, there’s this growing concern from the conservative side [saying] we have to stop this push for action on climate change. Then in 2008, the Southern Baptist Environment Climate Initiative came out. Southern Baptists in the US are the largest conservative Protestant denomination and they’re known to be politically conservative. We were heading into election year, so it’s going to be a major political shift, potentially. That ramped up concern. Without the Southern Baptists Environment and Climate Initiative perhaps it would have just kind of slowly fizzled. But that really suggested this movement was not going to go away.
I believe leaders on the Christian Right decided: “Okay, well, this issue is not going to go away. And we need to make sure that people know that what Biblically sound position on climate change is.” So they decided to get involved in this issue of climate change, which really has nothing to do with their core issues, most of the time. People like James Dobson, Dr. James Kennedy, who died in 2007, Jerry Falwell: the environment was not a big deal to them. And so it was unusual that they [leaders on the Christian Right] decide, you know, we’re really going to tackle this issue.
If you look at surveys over time—you can see the numbers between 2006 and 2014—there’s something like a 14 point increase in scepticism. And for many evangelicals, if they are politically conservative, then they’re getting a lot of politically conservative scepticism coming from venues like the media. But they were also getting it in radio programmes and TV programs directed towards Christian audiences. Back in 2000, i don’t think the idea that climate change was a liberal issue had solidified—that if you’re a good theologically conservative Christian you’re not going to be someone who accepts the human causes [because] that’s denying that God’s in control.
Why did they choose to go in that direction and not in the direction of supporting action against climate change?
RV: Basically, the evangelicals who have become involved in politics on the politically conservative side, you kind of make a bargain when you do that, which is that you’re going to work to integrate politically conservative ideas into your own ideology.
They were getting pressure from their coalition partners in the Republican party, who were saying, this is your field. Evangelicals are getting taken from us, this is a big issue for us, and you need to deal with that problem.
What do evangelicals who want to tackle climate change cite? Scientific studies? The Bible?
RV: Going back to the Environment Climate Initiative, it was grounded in theology, the need to care for “the least of these [Bible verse Matthew 25:40, 45, NIV].” It’s theology and science.
KW: My sense is—and I think this is true of most folks who are advocating on climate in some way particularly when they’re going to be coming up against sceptics—is they want to dot the i’s and cross their t’s in terms of science. When I was looking at the Evangelical Climate Initiative, they were also engaged in policy conversation at that time, they were pushing for cap and trade legislation. Not just creation care and stewardship and ecological theology, but also bringing in theological perspectives around how the impacts of climate change hit the most vulnerable people first and worst.
In some ways from that group at that time, theology may have been leveraged more often.That was part trying to pull this issue out of the left, out of the environmental movement, and into a more kind of centrist concern.
And you hear similar things from folks like [professor] Katharine Hayhoe [climate scientist and married to evangelical pastor]. She’s been a really fantastic communicator at the intersection of Christianity and climate. And that sense of, “because we care about people we need, we need to care about climate change” is definitely one of the core themes she talks about.
Katharine, in your book you wrote that the environmental movement was “dominated by tedious science and dry policy.” Obviously we need science to know climate change is happening, but what can scientists and evangelicals learn from one another when it comes to spreading the message?
KW: Certainly, the research that I did left me with some criticism of the mainstream, secular environmental movement or climate movement. To some extent, there’s been improvement since then.
What we’re talking about is a question of what it means to be human, and to be human on a planet that’s changing. And what our sense of responsibility is to this place and to one another. I think there are a lot of things that evangelicals do well, in terms of openly talking about values and beliefs in terms of storytelling, and in terms of taking issues that can feel really big and abstract and making them personal in some way.
RV: I agree. Listen to Richard Cizik and the story of his conversion to concern about climate change. I believe his faith really sustained that decision, so there is a power there. I do think that evangelicals are better talking to the common man and understanding basic concerns that people have, and environmentalists, unfortunately, have not been very good at doing that. Most people care about the environment, no matter who you are. And that’s how sceptics were able to get in there and kind of carve out a space for themselves even among people who care about the environment.
Secondly, there’s this thing called the evangelical mass media, which is radio TV, and digital communication specifically directed towards Christian audiences. I think it was really effective [at] creating some uncertainty and suspicion about climate change.
Environmentalists have relied on the secular media to convey their message. I think that they don’t have that direct grassroots connection. The way that their [evangelical] communities are structured, they have to stay close to the grassroots, because there’s no hierarchy. So they are constantly doing this nimble dance between what is my congregation believes, and where can I take leadership.
But they can’t go too far. They always have to stay really close to the grassroots. And I think that the structure of environmental communities is a little different, and maybe has made perhaps too much space to move away from basic communities and their concerns.
Do you think evangelicals have the power to save the planet? If enough see climate change as an issue, might Republicans see policies to tackle climate change as a way to win votes? Are they the key to tackling climate change?
KW: [laughs] I don’t know that evangelicals will save us. I do think it’s the youth movement that is the most likely to save us. I think the way that young people are changing the story opening up the cultural space that makes political action possible. And so I think young people are the most powerful kind of culture change agents that we’re seeing right now.
Are evangelicals who are very concerned about climate change a small minority, and is that minority made up of young people? And so, will young people from a range of different communities across society have to come together in order to tackle climate change?
RV: I kind of think it’s an open question. I have never seen [evangelicals concerns about climate change] broken down by age. We know that young evangelicals are more liberal on gay marriage homosexuality, and that kind of thing.
One of the things that could become an issue…I remember the people’s Climate March, I remember seeing somebody had a sign that the next flood won’t be Biblical. And there are these weird undercurrents of tension. Other people who look at religion and environmental activism have found that oftentimes evangelicals find themselves marginalized. Environmentalists want their political clout, but sometimes are suspicious of them as well. The main issue is that small disparate groups need to find ways to suppress their disagreements and join to a common cause.
That’s never easy, is it.
RV: It’s extremely difficult.
Based on your research, do you predict evangelicals as a whole will be convinced we need action on climate change?
KW: My anecdotal sense is that, yes, among younger evangelicals.
RV: Some people think that theology prohibits or makes it impossible for evangelicals to become concerned. I don’t think that’s true at all. I think theology is incredibly flexible.
People find ways to stay true to scripture while also bringing it to bear on present day concerns. I don’t think we need to worry about theology itself being some kind of barrier. But I think the grassroots effort can be slow. I don’t know whether, at least on the evangelical side, it’s going to gain momentum fast enough.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The Trump administration announced the final set of rules last month—a move decried by environmental activists as “illegal,” “dangerous,” and a “careless disregard for our nation’s public lands and wildlife.”
As with several of the administration’s policies in this realm, the regulations are largely seen by environmentalists as a blow to vulnerable species and a boon to industry. Activists and lawmakers have already sprung into action: Environmental groups promptly sued the Trump administration after the new rules were announced last month. On Wednesday, a coalition of state attorneys general led by California, Maryland, and Massachusetts also sued the administration over the changes. And earlier this month, the US Senate and House of Representatives introduced bills to block the rollbacks.
While we wait for the courts and Congress sort out the legality of the new rules, they will start to alter the way the Endangered Species Act is enforced in ways both big and small—immediately putting plants and animals already at risk in new danger. Some major changes include:
Overall, the new rules are so far-reaching that most species listed under the act or waiting to be listed will be affected in one way or another, experts say. Others may be affected if and when they are listed or petitioned to be listed. Here are nine examples of animals that will likely be made even more vulnerable by Trump’s changes:
In the past two decades, the monarch has declined by nearly 90 percent, according to the Center for Biological Diversity, which petitioned for it to be listed under the Endangered Species Act in 2014. It’s threatened by climate change, pesticides, and habitat loss.
“[P]opulations of this magnificent seabird in the three states, as well as in Japan, are in trouble, as lack of prey, climate change, fishing, oil spills, and other dangers take their toll,” the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote in 2014, the year the organization petitioned for the puffin’s protection under the Endangered Species Act. Tufted puffins, named for the fluff of yellow hair atop their heads, can be found in California, Oregon, and Washington.
Some moose populations in the Midwest—Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin—are under consideration for listing. Things are particularly bad for the moose in Minnesota, where only a few thousand of these massive mammals still roam, the Center for Biological Diversity estimated in 2016. The species is threatened by climate change, habitat loss, and other factors.
“This tiny toad is already threatened by invasive species, disease, climate change, groundwater extraction, and livestock grazing,” according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Native to Nevada, the toad was already “imperiled” by the time researchers first identified it in 2017.
The Pacific walrus, whose habitat includes sea ice, is likewise threatened by climate change. And “when the Fish and Wildlife Service evaluates whether it should be listed as threatened, they will need to look at climate data,” Rebecca Riley, legal director of the NRDC’s Nature Program, tells Mother Jones. “And the rule changes will make it harder for them to do so.”
“The wolverine is really a winter animal. They den in areas where there’s persistent spring snowpack,” Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity, tells Mother Jones. “And obviously, with climate change, we’re losing that spring snowpack.” Even if the wolverine gets listed as threatened, says Greenwald, the new regulations will make it harder to protect its habitat. “The whole idea that something that’s threatened by climate change doesn’t need habitat protection is just absurd. If they’re going to have any chance to survive, you have to protect more habitat, not less.”
The grizzly bear has been at the center of a legal battle lasting more than a decade between the Fish and Wildlife Service, which has moved to de-list the species, and environmental groups, which have sued to maintain its threatened status. Now, if the bear is de-listed, activists worry getting it re-listed under the new rules would be harder than ever before, as the species is threatened by climate change, according to Nicholas Arrivo, a staff attorney at the Humane Society of the United States. “They are losing staple food sources like the whitebark pine because of climate change. And so indirectly, they are becoming threatened by the loss of a climate-sensitive food source.”
In 2018, the Fish and Wildlife completed a scientific review of the Canadian lynx in the United States and found that the species had recovered and “may no longer warrant protection under the Endangered Species Act.” It recommended the species should be considered for de-listing. But Greenwald says the service didn’t consider the long-term impacts of climate change in its assessment, based on the now-codified definition of what “foreseeable future” means. The species will be “functionally extirpated,” or functionally extinct, in some areas by 2100, but “somehow, it’s ‘recovered’ and ‘de-listed,'” he says, “And that’s all under how far they look into the ‘foreseeable future.'”
Under the new regulations, the Fish and Wildlife Service may play less of a role in overseeing federal activities on endangered and threatened species’ habitat, like the gray wolf’s, Arrivo says. “Gray wolves are listed species in western states that are near potential sites for mineral exploration, mining, oil drilling, ranching, all the kind of consumptive industrial uses of federal lands that are in competition, in some sense, with the conservation of the species.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Hackers Broke Into Every Single One.,AJ Vicens,MotherJones,Politics,"A report issued Thursday by some of the country’s leading election security experts found that voting machines used in dozens of state remain vulnerable to hacks and manipulations, warning that that without continued efforts to increase funding, upgrade technology, and adopt of voter-marked paper ballot systems, “we fear that the 2020 presidential elections will realize the worst fears only hinted at during the 2016 elections: insecure, attacked, and ultimately distrusted.”
The 47-page report is the product of researchers who organized a shakedown of voting machines at the annual DefCon conference, one of world’s biggest information security gatherings frequented by hackers, government officials, and industry workers. First incorporated into DefCon in 2017 with the aim of improving voting machine security, this year’s version of the now-annual “Voting Machine Hacking Village” assembled over 100 machines and let hackers loose to find and exploit their vulnerabilities. While election officials have criticized the effort’s utility as a testing ground, deriding it as a “pseudo environment,” some have seen value in letting machines’ flaws become more known and potentially lead to security improvements.
“Once again, Voting Village participants were able to find new ways, or replicate previously published methods, of compromising every one of the devices in the room,” the authors wrote, pointing out that every piece of assembled equipment is certified for use in at least one US jurisdiction. The report’s authors, some of whom have been involved with election machine security research going back more than a decade, noted that in most cases the participants tested voting equipment “they had no prior knowledge of or experience” in a “challenging setting ” with less time and resources than attackers would be assumed to marshal.
The report urges election officials to use machines relying on voter-marked paper ballots and pair those with “statistically rigorous post-election audits” to verify the outcome of elections reflects the will of voters. The authors also warn that supply chain issues “continue to pose significant security risks,” including cases where machines include hardware components of foreign origin, or where election administrators deploy foreign-based software, cloud, or other remote services. The report lands as officials in several states are working to upgrade election equipment, and as lawmakers in Washington, D.C. debate federal election security legislation and funding.
Ultimately, the report notes flaws that have been acknowledged for years.
“As disturbing as this outcome is, we note that it is at this point an unsurprising result,” the authors conclude. “However, it is notable—and especially disappointing—that many of the specific vulnerabilities reported over a decade earlier…are still present in these systems today.”

Follow along below.
6:54 p.m. ET: Dan Friedman on Kurt Volker’s resignation:

6:47 p.m. ET: Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada became the first Republican House member to support the impeachment inquiry. “Let’s put it through the process and see what happens,” he told the Nevada Independent. Amodei even leaned into it a bit and said, if an inquiry showed someone using government agencies to try to tip an election, “there’s a problem.”
5:24 p.m. ET: The New York Times reports that President Trump met with Wayne LaPierre to “discuss how the NRA could provide financial support for the president’s defense” during the impeachment inquiry. LaPierre, head of the NRA, has been trying to make sure Trump doesn’t enact any gun control in the wake of mass shootings, according to the report. You may recall that earlier today, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) released an investigation calling the NRA a “foreign asset” during the 2016 election for Russia.

4:48 p.m. ET: The House issued its first subpoena. It requested a slew of documents related to the Ukrainian scandal from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo by October 4. And, in the accompanying letter, it also laid out a slew of Rudy Guliani’s public statements they say raise “troubling questions.”

2:08 p.m. ET: The only thing more delightfully dumb, impeachable, and insidious than a president of the United States calling an apostrophe a “hyphen” and nitpicking over CNN’s nitpicking over Trump’s nitpicking over grammar and spelling on Twitter, all in the past few hours, is a nation that takes the bait and more than a minute to talk about it. So I’ll write this in under a minute, and hope you read it in less.
At the doorstep of impeachment, shifting gears to rattle copy editors’ cages and stir up a grammar investigation is like Tactic 2 in Trump’s misdirection playbook, but petty begets petty, so our talent for obliging him was on full display this morning, when I awoke to a copy editor friend’s email titled “Trump became a copy editor overnight?” Every news outlet on the planet was asking the same. I would explain, but that would put us over a minute. Read more here. But don’t. ‹59 seconds› —Daniel King, Mother Jones copy editor
1:46 p.m. ET: Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would like to remind you—lest you’d forgotten—that Trump is a liar. Read analysis from David Corn, Mother Jones’ Washington, DC, bureau chief, here.
12:51 p.m. ET: Presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is finally on board with the impeachment inquiry.

12:18 p.m. ET:

10:40 a.m. ET: The White House confirms, for the first time, a major allegation in the whistleblower complaint, that the transcript of Trump’s phone call with Ukraine’s president was moved to a separate classified server. (Yes, a server.) A senior official told CNN that the decision for the highly unusual move came at the direction of lawyers for the National Security Council.
8:15 a.m. ET: Gabriel Sherman reports on the existential crisis hitting Fox News this week, with even Sean Hannity acknowledging that the whistleblower complaint at the center of Trump’s Ukraine scandal is “really bad” for the president. Meanwhile, White House aides are quickly realizing there is no roadmap.
7:50 a.m. ET: “This is no cause for any joy,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says on impeachment during an appearance on Morning Joe. “This is a very sad time for our country.” Pelosi also blasts Attorney General William Barr for going “rogue” in his unprecedented efforts to shield the president.

7:30 a.m. ET: Trump calls on House Intelligence chair Rep. Adam Schiff to resign.

7:00 a.m. ET: The president emerges Friday morning laser-focused and ready for battle. We won’t insult you by pointing out the obvious errors in this one.

Exciting! First off, here’s the Wall Street Journal explanation of what happened:
Did you get that? Inflation slowed, with core inflation of 0.14 percent in August. This is well below the target rate of 2 percent, which is not surprising since it’s a one-month number and the target rate is an annual number. You can’t compare them. Then we learn that core inflation actually stood at 1.77 percent year-over-year, its highest level since January. But 0.14 percent in a month is the same at 1.77 percent in a year. So why is the former “sluggish” while the latter is “the highest level since January”? They’re the same thing!
Does this make any sense to you? It doesn’t to me. Instead, how about if we stick with one measure—PCE core inflation on an annual basis—and see how it’s doing:
The answer is: not much. There’s a slight upward trend since the end of the Great Recession along with a lot of noise. We’ve seen three consecutive months of rising core inflation, but that’s obviously meaningless noise at the point.
So that’s the analysis: we’ve seen a slight increase over the past three months, but overall core inflation remains well under control and well under the Fed’s 2 percent target. End of story.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

So that’s the Biden side of the story. Your Foxbot friends will never hear any of this, so I figure it’s useful for you to have it all in one place. I assure you that there is no partisan slant to any of this. This is pure conventional wisdom, agreed to by virtually everyone outside the Trump orbit.

Because there was no making-an-offer-you-can’t-refuse quid pro quo in the memo reconstructing the conversation, Trump believed he could spin this document into a defense. The truth was that this account contained an extremely quid-pro-quo-ish exchange. When Zelensky said Ukraine wanted more US anti-tank weapons, Trump immediately replied with a request for a “favor”: that is, Ukrainian-made dirt he could use against Joe Biden and the Robert Mueller investigation. Even though GOPers and conservative pundits did cite the document in echoing Trump’s claims of innocence, its release did not help the president and his crew. But there was one head of state it did indeed help: Vladimir Putin.
The memo included remarks from Zelensky that made the new and inexperienced Ukrainian leader—he was previously a television comedian—look pretty damn bad. In the conversation, he slavishly kowtows to Trump’s improper requests. He sucks up to the American president by noting he stayed in one of his properties on a trip to New York City. More significantly, he diminishes the assistance Ukraine has received in its fight against Russia from President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. “They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine,” Zelensky is quoted in the White House account. And Zelensky reportedly agreed to the release of the reconstructed transcript because he had the impression that Trump would only be putting out Trump’s side of the chat—not Zelensky’s. So it appears the Ukrainian leader got played.
Trump’s decision to disclose the conversation has not led to a crisis in Ukraine for Zelensky—this spring he won the presidency with nearly three-quarters of the vote—but it has strengthened the hand of Ukraine’s biggest foe: Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 and remains in control of portions of eastern Ukraine that were seized by Russian and Russia-backed forces. This controversy has provided Moscow with a load of ammo for the disinformation campaign it has been waging against Ukraine and its government for years. Moscow, as Yevhen Fedchenko puts it, has “weaponized” Trump’s Ukraine scandal.
Fedchenko is the director of the Mohyla School of Journalism at National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy and a founder of the StopFake.org fact-checking website, which combats Russian disinformation about Ukraine. (The site recently posted a video debunking Russian news reports that claimed Ukrainian grandmothers were being armed with machine guns so they can defend themselves against Russia, that Ukraine is facing a second Chernobyl, and that several Ukrainian cities have been appropriated by Poland.) On Friday, Fedchenko explained to me how this recent episode is a gift for Moscow.
As Russia has continued its occupation of Ukraine, it has mounted an extensive disinformation campaign aimed at forcing Ukraine to accept Russian control of the territories it holds. And this effort has relied on several major themes: Ukraine is a failed state; Ukraine has diminished standing in the world and is not truly of concern to Western nations; Ukraine is a pawn in larger geostrategic conflicts; and the Ukrainian government is soaked in corruption (even though corruption has been on the decline). The so-called transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call reinforces these sentiments.
This memo, Fedchenko notes, can be cited by pro-Russia propagandists to show that “Trump won’t really do anything to protect Ukraine,” and Zelensky’s remarks about Germany and France can be used by pro-Russia elements to contend that Europe won’t be a stalwart defender of Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. “This material is useful for Russia propaganda,” Fedchenko says. “You can recycle it and say that now Ukraine is corrupting the US system and portray the Ukrainian government as an incompetent state and deny the agency of Ukraine. You can say it’s completely dependent on the US position.”
Fedchenko points out that in recent days the television networks, news agencies, and websites of Russia’s mainstream media—which are essentially controlled by Putin’s government—has pounced on the Ukraine scandal, devoting hours to the story, in order to advance Moscow’s interests. On the major networks in Russia, talking heads have advanced the messaging that Ukraine is not truly its own state and that other nations will not fully support it. This message is then spread into Ukraine through social media. The Russian propaganda push has also largely praised Trump for his handling of the situation and criticized the Ukrainian government for supposedly trying to influence politics in the United States. (Yes, you read that right.) “There are a lot of contradictions,” Fedchenko says. “Ukraine is a failed state that no one cares about, but Ukraine is manipulating US elections and politics.” That is, the disinformationists of Russia are mounting a classic play: Throw whatever you can at the wall and see what sticks.
The overarching goal for Russia is to get Ukrainians to believe that they are largely on their own. “There’s just Russia and Ukraine and no international coalition supporting Ukraine,” Fedchenko says, “and Ukraine is left without reliable military or political back-up.” And Zelensky’s remarks can be used—even if in somewhat of a tortured way—to push that point. As Fedchenko notes, “Russia wants there to be direct negotiations between the two countries, with Ukrainians believing no one cares about you. So let’s discuss peace, but on Russia’s conditions.” And this is a dangerous moment, he adds. Zelensky is inexperienced in diplomacy and governance, and he is not surrounded by a team of well-seasoned advisers and aides. (“Oh, Putin is loving this. It makes the Americans look unreliable and strengthens the hand of the Russians and the pro-Russians in the east,” Alex Crowther of the National Defense University told Foreign Policy. “By withholding aid, you are injecting instability into an already unstable situation and strengthening the Russians.”)
Fedchenko admits that he cannot quantify the ongoing Russian disinformation campaign now exploiting the White House memo. But he senses Moscow has revved up its propaganda efforts this week. “It’s intensified,” he remarks. “This case is certainly in progress. Russia is using this to try to corner Ukraine into one-on-one negotiations.”
By disclosing the quasi-transcript, Trump didn’t do himself any favors, and he certainly undermined Zelensky to Moscow’s advantage. But the same day Trump put out the memo, he went even further in screwing Zelensky. During a meeting with the Ukrainian president on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Trump said, “I believe President Putin would like to do something. I really hope you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem.”
It was a double whammy. First Trump provided Moscow a set of highly useful talking points for its disinformation war against a nation it has partially occupied; then he endorsed Putin’s strategic aim. Trump hurt himself this week, and he hurt Ukraine—but somehow he managed to hand Putin a beautiful gift.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The public release comes one day after lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees reviewed the complaint. Democrats have described it as nothing short of damning. “What this courageous individual has done has exposed serious wrongdoing,” Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters after reading the complaint on Wednesday. “I think it a travesty that this complaint was withheld as long as it was because it was an urgent matter. It is an urgent matter.” Some Republicans, including Sens. Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse, have also expressed concern.
Since reports of the whistleblower complaint surfaced earlier this month, Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in his communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. “When you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you’ll see at some point, you’ll understand that call was perfect,” he insisted on Tuesday.
Instead, when the White House released a non-verbatim transcript of the call on Wednesday, it showed Trump leaning on Zelensky to do him a “favor” and investigate matters related to the origins of Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia probe and probe Biden. Among other troubling details, the memo confirmed that Trump suggested Zelensky get in touch with Attorney General William Barr and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani about launching a Biden probe.

Follow along with us.
5:03 p.m. ET: A few polls are making the rounds showing increasing support for impeachment proceedings. After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed formal proceedings, Morning Consult showed a 7 percent jump in voters who support and a 13 percent jump among Democrats. Perhaps it’s the damning tick-tock news of the past few days, as Americans delve into the details of the call, or perhaps it boils down to Democratic voters falling in line with party leadership.

4:03 p.m. ET: Trump’s comments are always better on tape. The Los Angeles Times released audio of the president making menacing comments about the whistleblower at a private event. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart?” Trump said. “The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”
Listen to the audio below.

3:41 p.m. ET: In 2004, Mother Jones wrote about the personal and professional struggles Bush-era whistleblower Jesselyn Radack faced after disclosing that “American Taliban” John Walker Lindh had been interviewed by the FBI in Afghanistan without a lawyer. It also takes a look at the psychological forces that push people to become whistleblowers. Now is the perfect time to give the story a read—especially given the New York Times’ decision to release information about the whistleblower’s identity despite his lawyer’s assertions that doing so would be dangerous.

2:11 p.m. ET: We finally have some information on the identity of the whistleblower. He is a CIA officer with sophisticated knowledge of US foreign policy in Europe, the New York Times reports.
1:10 p.m. ET: Trump, attempting to divert attention from himself, all but threatens to execute the whistleblower. This is a very weird sentence to type, but how else do you interpret this?

1:04 p.m. ET: Here’s your Sergeant Schultz caucus:

12:58 p.m. ET:

12:05 p.m. ET: That “not the first time”  in the whistleblower’s complaint is still ringing in my ears. On Wednesday word trickled out that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wanted her impeachment served neat, no chaser—a “quick, narrow Trump impeachment probe focused on Ukraine,” as the Washington Post put it. This was in keeping with the wishes of many moderate Democrats in her caucus, who want the case for impeachment to be made narrowly, on national security grounds. That “not the first time” should blow up the whole conceit. Trump just doesn’t do narrow.—Tommy Craggs
11:32 a.m. ET: Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd is an interesting talisman for this whole process. Democrats may not technically need any Republican votes for impeachment (at the most recent count they have exactly the 218 votes they would hypothetically need, plus Republican-turned-independent Justin Amash of Michigan.) But Hurd has already announced he’s retiring, he’s criticized Trump in the past, and as a former CIA officer, the nature of this scandal seems developed in a lab to irk him. If Republicans ever do start to break ranks, it could start with him. (And conversely, if even Hurd stays on board, it’s going to be a one-party show.)—Tim Murphy
11:14 a.m. ET: The whistleblower complaint suggests that the White House attempted to cover up other politically sensitive information, in addition to the transcript of the phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Our colleague Pema Levy explains:
10:57 a.m. ET: Maguire hasn’t always seen eye-to-eye with Trump. Last month, Mother Jones reporter Dan Spinelli wrote about disagreements between the acting director of national intelligence and the president.
10:41 a.m. ET: Democrats are letting a critical opportunity slip away to explain the scandal that has triggered an impeachment inquiry. Intelligence Committee Dems are focusing their questions on the process by which the Acting DNI Maguire withheld the whistleblower complaint until yesterday. This seems geared at trying to show that the White House tried to block its release. But an hour and a half into the hearing, they have failed to address the meat of the complaint itself, which includes potential crimes and cover-ups and is far more explosive and damaging to the president than the ins and outs of Maguire’s decision-making on how to handle the complaint.—Pema Levy
10:15 a.m. ET: Maguire won’t say if he ever discussed the whistleblower complaint with the president:

9:45 a.m. ET: Some key moments from Maguire’s testimony so far:


9:25 a.m. ET: It’s about nude Trump pics, Devin Nunes says. (What is he talking about? Julia Ioffe can explain.)

9:20 a.m. ET: Rep. Will Hurd, who is not seeking reelection, joins a handful of Republicans expressing concern over the contents in the whistleblower complaint:

8:45 a.m. ET: The president sounds upset.

Worse, the whistleblower says he was told this was “not the first time” the system had been abused under Trump to hide politically sensitive information. The allegation, along with other emerging information, suggests fallout from the developing scandal could reach deep into the White House, its counsel’s office, and the national security apparatus.
According to the complaint, White House lawyers ordered that the transcript, which records Trump pressuring President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to conduct investigations that would benefit his political messaging, be stored in a special classified database managed by the National Security Council. Even though the transcript did not contain the kind of classified information usually held in that system, the move ensured many fewer officials would have access to this word-for-word record, which the whistleblower viewed as an acknowledgement that officials knew it documented an abuse of power that needed to be covered up. The president’s actions are likely a crime.
The whistleblower complaint explains the situation:
The complaint’s annex includes the whistleblower’s accusation that the decision to put the July call’s transcript into the classified system was only the latest instance in which it had been used to avoid scrutiny. “According to White House officials I spoke with, this was ‘not the first time’ under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive—rather than national security sensitive—information,” the complaint states.
The revelation raises serious questions that go beyond the central core of the still-developing Ukraine scandal, and threatens to envelop multiple White House officials and lawyers. Not only could such officials face repercussions for abusing the classification system, the documents they improperly filed, if revealed, could contain a wealth of information on embarrassing or illegal administration actions.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The fact that Trump suspended that aid shortly before personally asking Zelensky during a July 25 phone call to investigate Biden, the White House insists, isn’t evidence of wrongdoing.
Trump’s defense of his statements on the call is dubious at best. But a whistleblower complaint filed with the inspector general of the intelligence committee and released Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee makes clear that the scandal extends beyond that single phone conversation. What the whistleblower alleges is a far more complicated and extensive exchange of favors that Trump and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, sought to engage in with Ukrainian officials.
Between May and July, “multiple U.S. officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the President and President [Zelensky] would depend on whether [Zelensky] showed willingness to ‘play ball’ on the issues that had been publicly aired by [Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine’s prosecutor general until late last month] and Mr. Giuliani,” the unidentified whistleblower says in the complaint.
Those issues already publicly aired by Giuliani and Lutsenko included questions about the August 2016 release in Ukraine of the information that Paul Manafort, then Trump’s campaign chairman, had received millions of dollars in secret payments from the pro-Russia political party of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Manafort, who had been a consultant for Yanukovych, was booted from the Trump campaign due to those reports. Manafort claimed all the money he got from Ukraine was above board, but he was later convicted of crimes related to these payments.
Giuliani has asserted that the release of the Manafort information was not merely the exposure of corruption but actually represented nefarious “collusion between Ukrainian officials and Hillary Clinton.” Giuliani and Lutsenko have also attacked former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who criticized Lutsenko’s reluctance to combat corruption. Giuliani and Lutsenko alleged, among other unsupported claims, that Yovanovitch had worked to undermine Trump’s agenda in Ukraine. The State Department has denied these allegations and no evidence substantiating them has emerged.
As the whistleblower notes, Giuliani and Trump wanted Ukrainian assistance not just in smearing Biden but also in bolstering Trump’s claims that the Mueller investigation of the Trump campaign’s Russia contacts—which included the Manafort case—was launched on questionable pretenses. According to the whistleblower’s complaint, Trump’s emissaries indicated to Ukraine that in order to secure a personal meeting with Trump, Zelensky would need to provide such help. Trump’s delay of military aide to Ukraine may have gotten the attention of Zelensky’s government. Then, during the July 25 call, Trump asked Zelensky for a “favor”—that Ukraine work with Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate the origins of the Mueller probe. Trump said that “a lot” of the Russia scandal “started with Ukraine,” adding, “Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.” What’s more, Trump made this request for a “favor” immediately after Zelensky mentioned that he hoped to buy Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States, which sure sounds like a suggestion of a quid pro quo.
And there are plenty of indications such cooperation was under way. During his call with Trump, Zelensky seemed eager to give the US president what he wanted. “We are open for any future cooperation,” he said after Trump asked him to help Barr. Zelensky also said that one of his aides had already recently spoken with Giuliani and that “we will meet once he comes to Ukraine.”
Giuliani did not go to Ukraine. But according to the whistleblower, Giuliani did meet with one of Zelensky’s advisers on August 2 in Madrid. The complaint notes that US officials characterized this meeting, which was not publicly reported, as a “direct follow-up” to the “cases” Trump’s brought up in his call with Zelensky. Zelensky got his sit-down this week, when he and Trump met at the United Nations in New York.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

There was already damning public information thanks to a memo, released Wednesday, detailing what was said during Trump’s July 25 call with the leader of Ukraine, but the whistleblower’s complaint hints at other, similarly troubling conversations and a sprawling White House effort to cover it up. After Trump’s call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky , the whistleblower, a member of the intelligence community whose identity has not been revealed, claims that White House officials moved to “lock down” records of the call and improperly store them in an electronic system reserved for classified information. Crucially, the whistleblower added that this was “not the first time” Trump’s advisers have had to abuse this system to shield evidence of his calls with foreign leaders for political, not security, reasons.
The allegations were deemed “credible” by acting national intelligence director Joseph Maguire and intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson, both Trump appointees, but unsurprisingly, its findings were immediately challenged by Trump and his most rabid supporters. Trump fired the first volley Thursday morning from his Twitter feed with an all-caps message that said Democrats were trying to destroy the Republican Party “AND ALL THAT IT STANDS FOR.” He later deleted the tweet.
White House officials have already attempted to paint the whistleblower as a politically-motivated leaker, despite Maguire’s contention to House Intelligence Committee members during a Thursday hearing that he does not know the person’s identity. Fox News reported Tuesday that “the administration will release a document showing” the whistleblower “had indications of ‘political bias’ in favor of ‘a rival candidate’ of the president.” Atkinson also acknowledged to the Justice Department that the whistleblower has “some indicia of an arguable political bias,” but said the complaint nonetheless raises “urgent concern.” (The Office of the Director of National Intelligence also indicated in a letter to the whistleblower’s attorney that ODNI believes the complainant “has acted in good faith and fully complied with the law.”)
But the Trump administration is disregarding the assessment of the intelligence community. Their alternative line of reasoning was reflected in a set of White House talking points, which the administration inadvertently sent to House Democrats on Wednesday. “This case,” the White House statement said, “just shows another example of the ‘Deep State,’ the media, and Democrats in Congress damaging out national security by leaking confidential information in an attempt to seek political gain.”
During a private speech Thursday morning to American staffers at the United Nations, Trump said whoever provided information to the whistleblower was “close to a spy” and alluded to severe punishments for spies “in the old days,” according to reports in the New York Times and Los Angeles Times.
On Twitter, Trump’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., attacked “the media and their bosses at the DNC” for pushing the whistleblower’s narrative, which—it’s worth emphasizing—emerged from within Trump’s White House.

The whistleblower’s politics dominated pro-Trump Twitter, where the still-unknown intelligence official was painted as a liberal Trump critic.



Other Trump defenders, including former administration official Fred Fleitz, stuck with the narrative of an anti-Trump conspiracy. Fleitz, who served as chief of staff to national security adviser John Bolton and was under consideration to be Trump’s director of national intelligence, wrote in a tweet that the complaint was “too convenient and too perfect to come from a typical whistleblower.”

Fleitz’s hunch, which he floated online without evidence, is that Democratic House Intelligence Committee staff might have helped “orchestrate” the complaint. “It is therefore important that Congress find out where this complaint came from,” he wrote.
Not all Republicans were so easily persuaded that the complaint was a nothing burger. “There is a lot in the whistleblower complaint that is concerning,” Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), who is not seeking reelection, tweeted Thursday morning. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the complaint “troubling” and said “Republicans ought not just circle the wagons” to protect Trump just yet.
Not one House Republican has indicated support yet for Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to formally launch an impeachment inquiry. More than half of all House members—218 Democrats and one independent per the New York Times—do support the inquiry.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

This never-ending fusillade makes it is easy to lose sight of his individual acts of lowering (or demolishing) standards. Yet on Thursday morning, Trump’s top intelligence official presented a stunning reminder that Trump has violated what ought to be an important principle: A president should not brazenly lie and make shit up.
Yes, I know, Trump does this All The Time. And everyone—the media, Democratic and Republican lawmakers, and citizens throughout the land—have become inured to his audacious prevarications. Often, his false claims are directly contradicted by his own hirelings. (Case in point: Virtually all of Trump’s top national security appointees have stated they accept the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia covertly intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump, though Trump has repeatedly discounted or dismissed this finding.) Yet it still is important to push the pause button when one of Trump’s senior advisers publicly undermines Trump’s demagoguery and offers evidence that Trump is a doesn’t-give-a-damn-about-the-truth deceiver-in-chief. And that’s what happened when acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire appeared before the House Intelligence Committee for a fiery hearing focused on Trump’s latest scandal: the president’s alleged attempt to muscle the Ukrainian president to produce dirt he could use to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and to harm Joe Biden.
The subject, of course, was Maguire’s handling of a complaint sent by an unidentified intelligence official to the inspector general for the intelligence community that accused the president of abusing his office for political purposes and that claimed White House officials tried to bury evidence of this misconduct. It’s this controversy that has finally pushed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to declare that House Democrats were transforming their multiple investigations of Trump into an impeachment inquiry. Since this story emerged days ago, Trump has been fighting back in his usual manner of denying reality and disseminating false narratives and charges—that is, gaslighting. And a key component of his counter-attack has been denigrating the anonymous whistleblower.
Trump has brutally gone after the whistleblower in a series of tweets. He questioned his or her loyalty, asking, “Is he on our Country’s side”? He called this member of the intelligence community “highly partisan” and suggested this person was part of a conspiracy mounted against Trump by Democrats and the media. In a tweet citing a Fox News analyst, Trump accused the whistleblower of spying on him by secretly listening to his conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. (Trump was suggesting the whistleblower had committed a criminal act.) In another tweet citing another right-wing commentator, Trump essentially said the whistleblower was part of a cabal mounting a malicious and seditious effort against him. And Trump retweeted a conservative activist who claimed that the intelligence community’s inspector general had concluded the whistleblower had a “political bias” against Trump. (The IG found “some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate” but nevertheless determined that the whistleblower was credible.)
That is, before the whistleblower’s complaint was released on Thursday morning, Trump had mounted a robust smear campaign against this unknown person, pronouncing him or her a rat-fink and a traitor who was out to get Trump—a person whose complaint could not be taken seriously.
At the Maguire hearing, the acting DNI was asked about the whistleblower—whose identity remained a secret. Is the whistleblower a “political hack,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the committee queried. Maguire replied, “I believer the whistleblower is acting in good faith.” Schiff followed up: “You don’t have any reason to accuse them of disloyalty to our country?” Maguire provided an unequivocal response: “Absolutely not…I think the whistleblower did the right thing.”
In other words, there was no basis for Trump’s denunciations of the whistleblower.
Later in the hearing, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) returned to this subject. She asked Maguire, “Do you believe the whistleblower was spying…on the president?” Maguire answered, “I believe the whistleblower complied with the law and did everything they thought, he or she thought was responsible under the Intelligence Community Whistleblowers Protection Act.” Referring to one of Trump’s tweets, Speier continued: “Do you believe the whistleblower is on our country’s side?” Maguire replied, “I believe that the whistleblower and all employees who come forward to the [intelligence community] IG to raise concerns of fraud, waste, and abuse are doing what they perceive to be the right thing.” That was a careful answer, but surely no endorsement of Trump’s claim that the whistleblower was engaged in treasonous action.
Speier then asked Maguire if Trump had asked him to share the identity of the whistleblower. “I can tell you emphatically no,” he said. And had anyone else in the White House or Justice Department done so? “No,” he said.
So if Trump and the White House did not know the whistleblower’s identity, how could Trump question this person’s loyalty, blast him or her as a partisan plotter, and accuse the whistleblower of spying? You know the answer: Trump doesn’t need facts to mount a smear campaign. (Did Roy Cohn?) Trump concocts phony conspiracies and misleading narratives all the time. (Remember birtherism?) When caught in a misdeed, his first instinct is to attack and vilify, the truth be damned. After all, when has Trump been held accountable for such malfeasance?
The Ukraine scandal is yet another indication that Trump places his private interests over public service and recognizes few restraints when it comes to abusing the power of his office. And this instance of his lies being revealed by the man who runs the intelligence community for Trump signals yet again that Trump is a serial fabulist. In days past, a president caught in such blatant lying might actual suffer consequences—at least, a few pokes in the media and perhaps even within his own party for besmirching a US government official. These days, this Trump lie is just another piece of straw in one huge haystack. Trump’s intelligence chief tells us that Trump is a liar—and though the contradiction has drawn media attention, Trump’s action is hardly covered as outrageous. That’s a sign of Trump’s victory in his war against the norm of honesty.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

“The Federal Government consults with State and local governments not only to identify the best environments for refugees, but also to be respectful of those communities that may not be able to accommodate refugee resettlement,” the executive order states.
The new policies are in line with Trump’s ongoing efforts to severely limit legal immigration. For comparison, the “refugee ceiling” for 2019—previously the lowest in American history—was 30,000 people; in 2017, the last year the limit was set by the Obama administration, it was 110,000.
As Buzzfeed News originally reported, that ceiling is broken down further into categories; 5,000 slots are “dedicated to those suffering religious persecution, 4,000 to Iraqis who assisted the US government, 1,500 to refugees from the Central American countries known as the “Northern Triangle,” and 7,500 for others. The official determination for refugees will be submitted by Trump after a consultation period with Congress.”
In the decades before Trump’s election, the United States admitted more refugees each year than all other countries combined. According to a Pew Research Study, refugee admissions into the US have dropped significantly under the Trump administration, but the number of refugees worldwide is at its highest threshold since World War II.

As details of the crime were reported—two grad students on bikes had spotted Turner on top of the unconscious Miller behind a dumpster; when he ran, they chased him down—she remained publicly anonymous. Yet in the months afterward, Miller writes in her memoir, Know My Name, one of the only people she wanted to share her experience with was a hometown friend who had survived something similar, only to be informed there was not enough evidence to pursue a criminal case. When Miller told her friend that prosecutors in Santa Clara County, California, had decided to charge Turner with sexual assault, her friend leaned over and held her. Then she sat back, looked Miller in the eye, and said, “This is your opportunity.”
Miller seized it. Driven in part by the knowledge that most sexual assault survivors never get a chance to hold their assailants accountable in court, Miller spent the next year cooperating with police and prosecutors, sticking with the criminal legal process, despite the pain, embarrassment, and retraumatization that came along with it. After intense media attention and a 16-day trial, a jury convicted Turner of three counts of felony sexual assault. Judge Aaron Persky sentenced Turner to six months in county jail, probation, and sex offender registration, rationalizing that anything tougher would have a “severe impact” on the Olympic swimming hopeful. Miller, then known only as Emily Doe, wrote a victim impact statement that went viral after it was published by BuzzFeed. California changed its laws to impose mandatory prison sentences for sexual assault perpetrators whose victims are unconscious or intoxicated, and voters recalled Persky from the bench.
In Know My Name, Miller, now 27, tells the story of her life—and her attempts to piece it back together—following the now-notorious attack. It begins with the evening before the fraternity party that preceded the assault and continues through Turner’s sentencing and the years since, which saw the cultural changes of Donald Trump’s election and the #MeToo movement. While Miller’s victim impact statement sparked outrage about Turner’s brief jail sentence and the deference he received as a white Stanford athlete, the outrage that builds over the course of her book is not directed at Turner, or even Persky, but at a justice system that requires victims to go through hell all over again.
Miller’s experience is largely a story of the system working exactly as well as it was designed to. The detective who handled her case did not bungle or neglect the investigation. The prosector did not decline to file charges. Their jobs were made easier by abundant evidence: eyewitnesses, phone records, and a rape kit that was tested, not destroyed, in addition to Miller’s own testimony. And unlike the perpetrators of 98 percent of all sexual assaults reported to law enforcement, Turner was convicted and sent to jail. Miller, meanwhile, had a solid support system—a victim advocate, access to therapy, and a small circle of encouraging family and friends.
Yet this best-possible outcome did not provide Miller with a sense of justice or solace. Just the opposite: From the moment she woke up in the hospital following her attack, her decision to pursue a criminal case inflicted additional harm on her. There was the discomfort and humiliation of the rape kit exam, which Miller would describe viscerally in her victim impact statement as “long, pointed beaks inside me” and “a Nikon pointed right into my spread legs.” It took months before she learned whether she technically had been raped because her kit was stuck in the crime lab’s backlog of DNA evidence. Court dates were repeatedly pushed off, adding to her anticipation and dread. In part because of the unpredictability of the schedule, she gave up working full-time. (Miller was not a student at the time of the assault.)
Participating in the trial exacted a deeper toll. She writes that her character became “an asset my DA would need,” and that she had to be on her best behavior, because Turner may have hired a private investigator to watch her and gather potentially discrediting material. While preparing for trial and cross-examination, she became terrified of making any choice, no matter how small, that Turner’s defense attorney might use to impugn her character. Posting a smiling picture online, or having a drink, could be seized on to argue she had never really suffered from the assault.
Finally, there was the sentencing. After Turner was convicted, she received a call from a probation department officer to interview her as a routine part of a sentencing recommendation. According to Miller’s account, she told the officer that she wanted Turner to own up to what he’d done and get therapy while incarcerated. Miller later discovered the officer had interpreted her comments to mean that Turner should be given a “moderate” county jail sentence. To add insult to injury, the officer checked off Miller’s race as white without asking. Miller, who is half Chinese, felt that mistake reflected the indifference with which she had been treated.
After learning about the sentencing recommendation, Miller poured her rage into the 12-page, single-spaced victim impact statement that would later be read into the Congressional record and on broadcast news, turning “Emily Doe” into an avatar for the pain and anger of survivors everywhere. But it didn’t appear to make much difference. Persky limited the amount of time she had to read her letter, and then he chose to follow the probation department’s recommendation based on her misconstrued wishes.
At first, it didn’t occur to Miller that the system she was enmeshed in could be changed, much less challenged. But the successful campaign to recall Persky—the first successful judicial recall in California in 86 years—helped shift her perception of the possible. Over time, she came to regard the harms the system inflicted on her as fixable, not inevitable. It helped to see her experience as a test case. “I could convert my pain into ideas, could begin brainstorming alternate futures for victims,” she writes.
Know My Name never quite reaches the point of envisioning that different reality for survivors. But by its end, Miller makes a powerful case for overhauling a system that retraumatizes victims of sexual violence even in successful cases, perpetuating the feedback loop that discourages victims from coming forward to seek justice. “You ask us to sacrifice our sanity to fight outdated structures that were designed to keep us down,” she writes, defending survivors who choose not to report sexual assaults to law enforcement, and calling out the expectation that survivors must endure the unbearable in order to hold their perpetrators accountable.
The point of challenging the institutions that put Miller through hell isn’t to make the legal system more therapeutic for victims. Healing and recovery are part of an ongoing process outside the courtroom: Miller writes about finding comfort in small kindnesses—a winking court reporter, the cheerful nurses who administered her rape kit—and in revisiting her memories as part of writing this book. But the courtroom is the place to send a message to the Brock Turners of the world. “I know better than to think my peace arrives when the gavel hits, when the handcuffs clink shut,” Miller writes. “We don’t fight for our own happy endings. We fight to say you can’t.”

Above: On Tuesday, Miller’s publisher, Viking Books, published a short video illustrated and narrated by Miller, with her story and a message of support for other survivors. “Speak up when they try to silence you, stand up when they try to shove you down,” she says, drawing smiling cartoon figures on a blank, white wall. “No one gets to define you. You do.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In recent days, a growing number of Democrats have argued that Trump’s efforts to pressure Ukrainian leaders to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son could be grounds for removing the president from office.
“The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,” Pelosi said in televised remarks on Tuesday evening. “Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.”
Pelosi’s announcement, which came after she met with Democratic committee chairs and then with the full House Democratic Caucus, reflects a dramatic political shift resulting from Trump’s recent actions. Pelosi has previously opposed calls for the House to move toward impeaching Trump, arguing that it could backfire politically and harm efforts to defeat Trump next year.
But Trump’s apparently brazen effort to use US power for personal political gain has changed the equation. An impeachment trial has little hope of succeeding in the Republican-controlled Senate, but Democrats say Trump’s conduct leaves them no choice. The Trump administration, backed by the Justice Department, has also enraged Democrats by refusing to share with Congress a whistleblower complaint believed to relate at least in part to Trump’s pressure on Ukraine, despite a law that requires them to turn over such a complaint to the House and Senate intelligence committees. “This is a violation of law,” Pelosi said.
Listen to Mother Jones Washington Bureau Chief David Corn explain what happens next, in this special impeachment edition of the Mother Jones Podcast:
Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller reported in April that Trump’s campaign had extensive contacts with Russia and expected to benefit from Russia interference in the 2016 election. Mueller also found that Trump had taken various actions to thwart the special counsel’s probe that meet criteria for obstruction of justice. But Mueller concluded that he could not establish that the Trump campaign engaged in a conspiracy with the Kremlin, and he decided, based partly on Justice Department policy, not to recommend charging Trump with obstruction. That left Democrats divided over the politics of impeachment.
Caught between Pelosi’s trepidation and pressure from progressives, the House Judiciary Committee previously launched a tortuously defined investigation that Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the panel’s chairman, argues is effectively already an impeachment inquiry, though the full House has never voted to launch such a probe.
Trump’s conduct toward Ukraine has blown away such hang-wringing, uniting Democrats. More than a dozen additional Democrats—including several who won in hotly contested swing districts last year—have called for impeachment or an impeachment inquiry since Monday.
Trump has publicly admitted to pressing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky for information about Biden, effectively daring Democrats to stop him. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump urged Zelensky roughly eight times to work with Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on an investigation into the Bidens. Democrats say they have an obligation to act to stop such conduct.
“Any attempt by a President to use the office of the presidency of the United States for personal political gain—rather than the national interest—fundamentally undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution,” Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who chair key congressional committees, wrote in a letter Tuesday to White House counsel Pat Cipollone. “If the recent reports are accurate, it means the President raised with a foreign leader pursuing investigations related to a political opponent in an upcoming US election. That is the very definition of corrupt abuse of power.”
The Democrats demanded that Cipollone turn over documents related to Trump’s contacts with Zelensky by Thursday.
Trump and Giuliani have tried to make an issue of Biden’s push in 2016 for Ukrainian leaders to fire the country’s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, over his reluctance to investigate corruption in the country. Biden’s actions were part of an international effort to oust the prosecutor. Trump has asserted, without evidence, that Biden acted to protect his son, Hunter Biden—who had a board seat on a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings—from an investigation by prosecutors there. But Shokin was not actively investigating the company at the time of his ouster. This was reportedly part of the reason he was removed.

But in August, the Trump administration instituted a “domestic gag rule” that blocked the nearly 4,000 health care facilities receiving a total of $286 Million in Title X funds from performing or even referring patients for abortions. The effects of that rule are already being felt, especially in states where Planned Parenthood has few options to make up for the lost funds.
As my colleague Marisa Endicott wrote in August when the gag rule first went into effect:
Planned Parenthood resigned from the program, arguing that it would no longer be able to provide their patients with a full spectrum of care if it remained. Since then, the nation’s largest single provider of reproductive healthcare for women has been scrambling to make up the difference. In some places like California, the state government has stepped in to fill the void, ensuring Title X patients are able to receive the full range of care they need. But in states like Iowa and Minnesota, whose state legislatures are dominated by Republican lawmakers, clinics receive no additional state funding and are unable make up the $4 million budget difference.
“This is an attack on the freedom of women to make decisions about their own lives,” says Sarah Stoesz President and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, which includes Iowa and Minnesota. “But it is not an attack on all women’s freedom, it is only an attack based on how poor they are.”
Since its creation, the Title X program has provided grants from Health and Human Services to a network of providers including state health departments, family planning clinics, and universities. These providers then channel money to a much larger list of sub-grantees across the country. Before Trump changed the rule, patients who qualified for the Title X program would receive services at clinics and then pay along a sliding scale. Individuals with incomes at or below the poverty line who went to Planned Parenthood clinics would pay nothing for reproductive health services, and those with incomes between 100 and 250 percent of the federal poverty level were charged on a needs-based scale.
While, this is still the case, patients who go to a Planned Parenthood in Iowa and Minnesota who may have previously been paying nothing for services such as as contraceptive care, STI screenings, and cervical cancer screenings, are now having to pay out of pocket. “Women who have commercial insurance, women who have money, aren’t going to feel this at all because they will still be able to go to whatever provider they want including Planned Parenthood and they will be able to ask any question they want to about abortion,” says Stoez. “It is only the poorest of the poor who are being attacked this way.”
As a nurse practitioner at the Minneapolis Planned Parenthood, Kaitlyn Vaske-Wright has seen the effect of losing Title X firsthand. “We’ve seen a pretty big increase in folks leaving the clinic due to cost,” says Vaske-Wright. The clinic has been working to help cover some of the costs, but many patients who have been coming there for years expecting certain prices are now unable to get the services they need.
“The most emotional conversations are typically around their birth control or their emergency contraceptives,” explains Vaske-Wright. She says that some patients have even passed up emergency contraceptives, which have a very narrow time period in which they can be taken, once they learn how much it would cost without Title X. “Despite all my medical training I’m not able to get patients the care they need,” she says. “It is happening daily, multiple times a day and I’m not sure what else I can do to help my patients more than I already am—and that’s very difficult to swallow right now.”
Many clinics are scrambling to figure out ways to offer services at reduced fees for their most vulnerable patients. Others are exploring the creation of  patient assistance fund through private donations, but none of this would be sufficient to cover the loss of Title X funds. “Suddenly our reliable partner in the federal government has disappeared,” says Stoez. “And it is very difficult for private sector donors to step in and make up the difference between what the federal government used to provide and what they currently do not provide.”
For the majority of these patients finding another clinic isn’t an option. In Minnesota, Planned Parenthood served over 90% of all Title X patients and was the only network of family planning providers in the entire state. In general, roughly 60 percent of women who use Title X facilities say it’s their only source of health care at all. Which means some of the most vulnerable individuals in the state may now be going without medical care of any kind.
The battle to save the Title X program is still underway. On Monday, the Ninth Circuit Court heard oral arguments from a lawsuit filed by 21 states and the District of Columbia, several doctors, clinics, and Planned Parenthood. They are charging that the new rule violates a congressional rider that states all pregnancy counseling must be neutral, since it requires providers to refer patients for prenatal care and blocks them from referring patients for abortions, regardless of whether they have expressed a desire to terminate their pregnancy. The court will decide if preliminary injunctions halting the gag rule issued by federal trial judges in San Francisco, Washington, and Oregon can go into effect. No ruling has been made yet, but the same panel of judges voted 7-4 in July to keep the rule in place until after the appeals process is resolved.
Another option could be Congress that also has the ability to block the Trump administration from going forward with its plans to severely limit Title X. In June, the House of Representatives passed a spending package that included Title X protections, however it is doubtful the measure could pass the Republican held Senate.
“Four million dollars of free health care has been lost and that is a lot of money no matter how you slice and dice it,” says Stoez. “A lot of people were served by four million dollars.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In the last day, we’ve learned that Trump reportedly froze $391 million in military aid for Ukraine, suggesting the possibility of a quid pro quo that would give the president an edge over a potential competitor in the upcoming election. Trump also admitted to discussing Biden on a phone call with Zelensky. The scandal was set in motion by a whistleblower complaint, categorized by the intelligence community’s inspector general as being “of urgent concern,” which the White House has refused to turn over to Congress.
Here’s the latest. We’ll keep updating as the news unfolds.
10 p.m. ET: In a special breaking news episode of the Mother Jones Podcast, Washington DC bureau chief David Corn and foreign influence and national security reporter Dan Friedman join host Jamilah King to discuss how a secret whistleblower complaint against Donald Trump rapidly transformed from a trickle of news into a full-blown torrent that finally broke the impeachment dam.
7:58 p.m. ET: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supports Pelosi’s efforts—she told reporters that “what [President Trump] has already admitted to is an impeachable offense.” Sam Van Pykeren writes:

6:57 p.m. ET: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy responded to Pelosi’s announcement. “This election is over,” he said. “I realize 2016 did not turn out the way Speaker Pelosi wanted it to happen. But she cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide we’re in an impeachment inquiry.” He ended by saying, “It’s time to put the public before politics.” Sure!

6:40 p.m. ET: It continues.

5:20 p.m. ET: Trump has, predictably, begun melting down on Twitter.



5:08 p.m. ET: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi officially announces an impeachment inquiry. “The Trump administration’s actions undermine our national security and intelligence…the president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.”

Daniel Friedman writes:
Keep reading here.
4:47 p.m. ET: Our own Kara Voght has more on the intraparty maneuvering over impeachment proceedings. While Nancy Pelosi seems to have mollified anxious progressives who wanted the impeachment inquiry to remain under the purview of the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), there are apparently lingering concerns among House leadership about Nadler and his staff:
4:36 p.m. ET: The pressure is mounting for Trump to make the whistleblower’s complaint public. The Senate unanimously passed a non-binding resolution calling on Trump to release it, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) tweeted.

4:26 p.m. ET: Why impeach? One screamingly obvious reason is that it corners the GOP into defending an unpopular president. This is an unpleasant position to be in, particularly for a swing-state Republican. Here’s Sen. Cory Gardner, the vulnerable Colorado Republican, trying very much to find a desk to dive under:

3:45 p.m. ET: Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee has opened its own inquiry into the Ukraine matter. Yahoo News has a letter from the committee—signed by Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.)—to Andrew Bakaj, the lawyer who represents the whistleblower. “[W]e are writing to request that you make your client available for a closed bipartisan interview with Committee counsel no later than Friday, September 27, 2019, in a mutually agreeable secure location,” it reads.
The letter seems to have perked up a lot of people who are bleeding from the teeth for a Goldwater–Nixon moment. But remember that Burr was a national security adviser to Trump’s campaign in 2016, and as chair of the Senate intel panel, he has not exactly covered himself in glory.
3:36 p.m. ET: A little impeachment brings everyone together:

3:34 p.m. ET: Joe Biden went on TV and stood in front of some flags:

3:19 p.m. ET: Trump is fundraising off impeachment. Here’s the email that just went out to supporters, subject line “Impeachment Meeting: 4 PM EDT”:
3:08 p.m. ET: The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal back up the Washington Post’s reporting that Nancy Pelosi will announce a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.
2:52 p.m. ET: Do you care what James Comey thinks about impeachment? Of course you don’t, but here he is anyway, sanctimony spreading across your computer screen like an oil slick: “I think the American people would be let off the hook if Donald Trump were impeached and removed from office.”


2:46 p.m. ET:

2:38 p.m. ET: “The quid pro quo is not essential to an impeachable offense,” says Nancy Pelosi, speaking at The Atlantic Festival. She also says Trump “has made lawlessness a virtue in this country.”
2:34 p.m. ET: Three top congressional Democrats say they’re giving the White House three days to turn over documents related to the Ukraine affair.
2:24 p.m. ET: Trump with the modified limited hangout:

2 p.m. ET: Mother Jones’ Kara Voght and David Corn report:

The email contained several dubious promises, including the claim that immediate contributions would result in donors being added to an “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force.” The email also stated that donations would be “double matched”—which is unlikely to be true, due to federal campaign finance laws that impose strict limits on political donations.
The number of Democrats calling for impeachment has risen gradually over the summer, but as recently as last week this step was still opposed by the Democratic Party leadership. Following revelations that Trump pressed Ukraine’s president to investigate discredited allegations against Joe Biden and withheld military aid from the country to ramp up pressure, dozens of Democratic lawmakers joined the call to begin impeachment proceedings. Ahead of a 5 p.m. press conference Tuesday afternoon, at which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to publicly call for an impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign fired off its fundraising pitch:
The email also suggested that by donating to the campaign supporters would be defending the very integrity of America:
The fundraising appeal claimed that Trump had personally requested to see a list of people who had joined his “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force” and urged donors to send their money before 3:30 p.m., when the list would supposedly be sent to the president. Shortly after the deadline passed, Trump’s campaign sent a nearly identical email, this one saying the deadline was 4 p.m.
Campaigns have fairly wide latitude to make promises in campaign fundraising emails, so Team Trump’s claims of an official “Task Force” or that Trump would personally review the names of donors don’t have to be true. Another suspect claim: the email’s pledge that donations would be “double-matched.”
Donor match programs are common in the nonprofit fundraising world and are considered to be highly effective in encouraging donors who might be on the fence about giving. In the nonprofit world, a match program typically involves a one or several particularly generous donors, who are poised to write big checks if smaller donors start giving. However, in the political sphere, federal campaign finance laws make things a little more complicated, since individual donors are legally capped at giving no more than $5,400 to a campaign per election cycle. That means a single generous donor can’t match new small donations. If a campaign wants to raise money on any large scale, even a handful of generous matching donors won’t work—hundreds or thousands would be necessary. It’s unlikely that would really happen.
The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about its “Official Impeachment Defense Task Force,” how many donors had joined, or how it planned to “double-match” their contributions.

Now What?,Matt Cohen,MotherJones,Impeachment,"It’s happening: On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump following reports last week that Trump attempted to bully Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating former vice president and Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden’s son.
But the process for impeaching a president is neither quick nor easy. And it’s potentially risky—Pelosi has agonized over what would happen if the House didn’t have enough votes to start an impeachment inquiry—which is why the speaker and other House leaders have refused to move forward with impeachment proceedings despite a growing consensus among the House Democratic Caucus. Pelosi’s statement on Tuesday suggests we’ve reached a tipping point on the issue for House Democrats.
The impeachment of a president has only happened twice—to Andrew Johnson in the aftermath of the Civil War, and Bill Clinton for lying about and trying to cover up his sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. (Articles of impeachment were brought up against Richard Nixon in 1974 in response to the Watergate scandal, but he resigned before he was formally impeached.)
And with the 2020 election not far away, we are wading into relatively uncharted territory. So what happens next? What would the impeachment process look like? What would it take to actually have Trump removed from office? And what does this mean for all the ongoing House investigations into the many Trump scandals?
To get a better sense of what could be in store, I spoke with Michael Conway, an attorney who served as counsel for the US House Judiciary Committee in the impeachment inquiry of Nixon in 1974.
What is needed for the impeachment inquiry to begin? Will there be a vote?
There’s disagreement about whether you need a vote of the entire House. But, historically, the answer to that is yes. And that’s both in the Nixon impeachment and the Clinton impeachment. In the Nixon impeachment, the House voted 410-4 to start an impeachment inquiry, which I think underscores the fact that it was less politicized, but it also underscores the fact that starting an impeachment inquiry is not the equivalent of voting for impeachment. In fact, many Republicans who supported President Nixon voted to start an impeachment inquiry. And I think that’s going to be a continuing issue. But the traditional test has been a vote of the House. And if they did that they’d be on much more solid ground.
How have impeachment inquiries typically gone in the past? What was the process like when you served on the House impeachment inquiry committee for Nixon?
Traditionally, it’s gone to the House Judiciary Committee, but there’s no absolute requirement to do that. The House Judiciary Committee has done a little bit of this. For example, in Nixon’s case, the Committee set up a brand new independent inquiry staff, headed by John Doar as special counsel—that’s the staff I served on—instead of using their already pre-existing staff members. And part of that was because the Judiciary Committee has a lot of responsibilities in addition to impeachment. And so setting aside a group whose sole function was to investigate the grounds for impeachment was what happened there.
And in that case, the Committee got reports from our staff over time, but essentially the staff did an investigation—in large part based upon what the Senate Committee had done before and what the Grand Jury had sent us—and then presented the evidence to the Committee.
And how did the House decide on the articles of impeachment based on the reports you sent the Committee? How would it work for this impeachment inquiry?
The Committee heard a few witnesses, but not a tremendous number and not in public sessions, and then the Committee debated the articles of impeachment, which were actually rewritten once the evidence came in. In other words, every article that is authored by congressmen right now don’t have to be the articles voted on, the articles voted on can be conformed to whatever the evidence happens to be. So that would be the process that has worked before. Now, there’s no requirement to follow that process, but that’s the template.
Listen to Mother Jones Washington Bureau Chief David Corn explain what happens next, in this special impeachment edition of the Mother Jones Podcast:
What additional powers do House Democrats get by declaring a formal inquiry? Would they finally get access to some of those long-sought after documents, like Trump’s tax returns? Or witnesses who haven’t agreed to testify on obstruction, or other inquiries?
Yes, to a larger extent. A witness can always plead the Fifth Amendment, but for political reasons people don’t always want to do that. For example, Grand Jury material is typically secret, but there are few exceptions to when the court can release them. In the Nixon impeachment, the Grand Jury sent us the report and sent us some White House tapes that they had obtained. The judge, [former District judge John] Sirica, ruled that he had the authority to do that. That went up on appeal to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. And this is a critical point: It ruled that he had the authority to do that.
In April of this year, the DC Circuit, in a 2-1 vote where a historian was trying to obtain Grand Jury material, ruled that the court lacked the authority to release the Grand Jury material. And when the dissenting judge said, ‘Well, what about the Haldeman Case?’ He said, ‘Well that’s an impeachment.’ And so, the fact that it’s a formal impeachment would very much strengthen the Committee to get Grand Jury material, the same thing for compelling witnesses to testify overruling executive privilege and so forth. So, that would be an important legal step forward to strengthen the Committee’s ability to get information.
That could take a long time, though, right? And the Democrats seem to want to move quickly on this.
It takes a long time for the court, yeah. For example, the hearing on the Grand Jury release isn’t scheduled until Halloween. So I don’t think there would be a ruling on that—even if the Judge had it all certain, even if the Judge ruled on the actual day of the hearing—you’re talking about five or six weeks from now. But Congress has the ability to hold people in contempt. They don’t have to go to court. Congress itself has the power to compel, and if they’re stonewalled by the White House that actually is considered an interference with the investigation, which is in itself an impeachable offense. When President Nixon refused to comply with subpoenas and so forth, he was obstructing an impeachment investigation, which then becomes an impeachable offense. And it’s also a criminal offense.
There are already investigations into Trump’s obstruction of justice, so would those hearings be rolled into an impeachment investigation?
It could be. I’ll give you a historical example: In Nixon’s case, there were five articles of impeachment that were presented to the Committee for vote. Three were adopted and two were rejected. One of the rejected ones was about illegal bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. The other one was whether Nixon violated the emoluments clause and committed tax fraud. But the problem that the Committees have from a public opinion point of view is being sufficiently focused so that it doesn’t look like it’s a cafeteria-style impeachment; one of these and one of those. They need to focus and the Ukraine thing may be what becomes that focus.
Even with the House officially opening an impeachment inquiry and, let’s say the House ends up voting for impeachment, would this all be moot if Mitch McConnell refused to hold a trial?
He can’t refuse. If the House voted impeachment and set the resolutions, the Senate is supposed to set aside all other business and consider the impeachment. That’s what happened in Clinton’s case. Of course in Nixon’s case, he resigned before even the full House vote, before the Committee voted. Now, they can certainly vote down the impeachment, but there is no ability like there was with the judicial nominations to simply not call it up for consideration. It has to be called up.
If the Senate votes down impeachment, then it’s dead in the water?
Yes. But there have been lots of impeachments where the Senate has acquitted people—Bill Clinton is the example that comes to mind. Historically, the Secretary of War back in the 1870s was impeached. He resigned and then the Senate had the trial. They ended up acquitting him, but they had the impeachment. And, of course, the fact that he’s not actually removed from office doesn’t mean that the public isn’t then better informed about what the charges were presented against them. Same thing with Bill Clinton. Now, Bill Clinton was not convicted, but certainly the public got a better educational message about what was alleged to have happened. So, there’s a value in educating the public even if the Senate doesn’t vote to remove him. An impeachment is a charge, the trial is the center, the trial itself would be must-see TV, that’s for sure.
What would Chief Justice John Roberts’ role actually be when he’s presiding over an impeachment trial? Is it largely ceremonial, or does he make actual decisions that matter?
He would preside over the Senate trial, but when Chief Justice Rehnquist presided over the Clinton trial, he viewed himself as being largely ceremonial. For example, in a trial, a judge can rule whether evidence is admissible or not. But in the Senate, if there were some objection to admissibility of evidence, the Senate would vote on the objection. So, the judge in an impeachment trial doesn’t have the normal authority that a judge has in presiding over a regular trial and making rulings. The judge is simply the person who’s presiding over the proceeding but doesn’t really have the authority to make rulings in the proceedings.
What is the Department of Justice’s role in impeachment? What will William Barr do?
Nothing. They have no role. An impeachment is strictly a Congressional prerogative. If there’s a trial in the Senate, the House then elects the prosecutors, who could be—and typically have been—also House members, but they can be assisted by attorneys representing them. In the Nixon impeachment inquiry, and also in conformity with the rules that were adopted recently by the House Judiciary Committee, the president’s personal lawyer can participate and defend. In our circumstance, James St. Clair was Nixon’s personal lawyer, he was able to present evidence to the Committee, make arguments to the Judiciary Committee and so forth. So, it’s not as if the president is defenseless, but the Justice Department has no role whatsoever.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Whatever else you can say, none of this is their fault.
It’s the fault of a Republican Party that went over the edge of partisan rage and destruction long ago. They’re the ones who tried at every turn to prevent President Obama from rescuing the economy after he took office. They’re the ones who were willing to die on the hill of protecting tax cuts for the rich. They’re the ones who have relentlessly gerrymandered and suppressed the black vote because that’s good for Republicans. They’re the ones who spent years trying to tar Hillary Clinton over Benghazi. They’re the ones who stonewalled the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. They’re the ones who got so caught up in their own loathing of Hillary Clinton that they turned away from the pussy tape and voted for Trump anyway. They’re the ones who spent their first year in office desperately trying to take away health care for the poor and working classes.
Democrats don’t always cover themselves in glory. But Trump is in office because the Republican Party put him there, and he’s gotten away with everything so far because the Republican Party has let him. No one should ever forget that.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Trump repeatedly urged Volodymyr Zelensky, the newly elected Ukrainian president, to discuss the matter with Attorney General William Barr and Rudy Giuliani, who is Trump’s personal attorney.
“I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,” Trump told Zelensky, according to the memo, before suggesting that the Ukrainian government should investigate a series of matters related to Trump’s domestic political opponents. “Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”  He continued to repeatedly reference baseless allegations against Biden.
The release of the document comes one day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced plans to launch a formal impeachment inquiry.
Trump’s efforts to push for a Ukrainian investigation—which Democrats say amount to the president, yet again, encouraging foreign interference in a US election—first came to light earlier this month after reports surfaced of a whistleblower with knowledge of the phone conversation filed a complaint with the intelligence community’s inspector general. Trump has repeatedly dismissed allegations of malfeasance, claiming that the phone conversation was “perfect.” But the memo’s release on Wednesday appears to contradict that.

The memo released by the White House recounting the July 25 call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a bombshell. But Trump and his defenders in the GOP, FoxWorld, and conservative circles are trying to repeat the move he staged in the Russia scandal and claim this is no biggie because the memo does not depict Trump explicitly engaged in criminal activity. Don’t buy this baloney.
Throughout the Trump-Russia scandal, the president and his cultists have insisted that he did no wrong because there was no direct collusion between him and the Russian operatives who hacked his Democratic opponents and used WikiLeaks to disseminate the purloined documents. That was the standard that Trump set via his tweets and tantrums: no collusion, nothing to see. And he mostly succeeded with this tactic. When special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report concluded that Trump had not been part of the criminal conspiracy waged by Russia against the 2016 election (to help Trump), he declared vindication. And with that braying, Trump managed to sidestep being publicly branded as a scoundrel for having betrayed his nation by aiding and abetting the Russian attack. (During the campaign, Trump encouraged the Russian assault but publicly denied it was happening even as he sought to benefit from it, providing cover to a foreign adversary seeking to subvert an American election.) Trump made collusion the core issue—because he obviously did not directly plot with Moscow—and, consequently, his actual treachery, which was profound but not necessarily criminal, drew less attention.
That success is shaping how Trump is now confronting his latest scandal: the allegation that he leaned on Zelensky to produce dirt on Biden in exchange for US military aid. With this controversy pushing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch an impeachment inquiry, Trump and his gang have had to devise a strategy for containing this fire—which has been fueled by the revelations that a whistleblower filed a report with the intelligence community’s inspector general expressing concern about Trump’s interactions with Ukraine and that the acting director of national intelligence was ordered (probably by the White House) to violate the law and not share this report with Congress. The game plan for Trump and his gang, once again, is to distract from Trump’s clear-and-present wrongdoing by asserting he didn’t actually do something worse, such as break the law.
The memo the White House issued depicts Trump abusing his power, as he pressures Zelensky to investigate Biden, one of Trump’s key political rivals. It does not provide evidence of a quid pro quo. Trump does not outright say, “Hey, pal, if you want your $400 million in military aid, you will get me good shit on Biden and also stuff that clears Paul Manafort.” But this memo notes on the first page that it is not a “verbal transcript”—though it is structured as a transcript—and merely “records the notes and recollections” of officials who listened to the call. So there is no telling if a more damning phrase or sentence was uttered by Trump during the conversation. (And this one memo does not cover Trump’s other conversations about Ukraine, such as his chats with number-one henchman, Rudy Giuliani, who has been searching for oppo research in Ukraine.) But even without such a let’s-make-a-deal line, the memo is extraordinarily damning.
In this account, Trump congratulates Zelensky, a former television comedian, on his election victory and points out that the United States has been “very very good to Ukraine.” And when Zelensky tells Trump that Ukraine wants to purchase more Javelin antitank missiles from the United States, Trump responds in a quid-pro-quo-ish manner by saying, “I would like you to do us a favor though.” He goes on to suggest to Zelensky that the server of the Democratic Party that was hacked by the Russians somehow ended up in Ukraine, perhaps with a Ukrainian oligarch. And he asks Zelensky “to find out what happened.” (There is no basis for believing the DNC server wound up in Ukraine—and it never disappeared in the first place.) Trump notes that Mueller’s investigation recently ended but that “a lot of it started with Ukraine.” And he requests that Zelensky “get to the bottom of it.” Trump adds, “It’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.” This appears to be an attempt to push Zelensky to produce information that will somehow discredit the Mueller probe and counter the Trump-Russia scandal. And it could be an effort on Trump’s part to obtain information—or disinformation—that could be used to undermine the prosecution and conviction of Paul Manafort, his campaign chair, who ended up in prison on charges related to his lucrative dealings in Ukraine.
Trump then presents another ask to Zelensky. He cites the fact-free conspiracy theory that Biden, when vice president, urged the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor (who was widely seen as corrupt) to protect a Ukrainian company on whose board Biden’s son, Hunter, sat. (Biden did press for this prosecutor’s dismissal, representing the desire of many Western nations, and there is no evidence it had anything to do with his son’s connection to the Ukrainian firm.) Trump says, “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that.” He requests that Zelensky talk to Attorney General Bill Barr about this matter (which has no merit). And he also tells Zelensky to be in contact with Giuliani, his personal lawyer, in this regard: “Rudy very much knows what’s happening.” And while discussing all this, Trump predicts that Ukraine’s economy will “get better and better.” Several times, Trump reiterates his desire that Zelensky talk to Barr and, especially, to Giuliani, who had previously acknowledged in public that he aimed to uncover dirt on Biden in Ukraine. (The Justice Department claims Barr never spoke to Zelensky.)
Whether this memo reveals all or not, one picture is clear: Trump used his office in an attempt to obtain disparaging information on a political foe and seek material to undercut an official US government investigation. The tenor of the conversation is undeniable: If Zelensky wants a decent relationship with the Trump administration and more Javelin missiles, he should do this “favor” for Trump. And at the time of the call, the Trump administration was withholding that previously authorized $400 million in military assistance—and providing no explanation for this move. Trump was not asking Zelensky to assist an authorized Justice Department investigation that was underway. This was what political pros call ratfucking. Trump was exploiting his presidential power to gain assistance from a foreign government for his reelection. It was collusion.
Trump, though, in his black-is-white fashion, is claiming this memo as absolution, proclaiming it contains no indication of a quid pro quo.


Following Trump’s lead, on Capitol Hill, Republicans are squawking like parrots: “no quid pro quo.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) sniffed in a tweet: “Wow. Impeachment over this? What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger.” And talking points sent out by the White House insist the Trump-Zelensky conversation was “entirely proper,” that Trump was only asking Zelensky to investigate Ukraine’s possible interference in the 2016 election, and that Trump was making a legitimate suggestion that Zelensky speak to Giuliani about the Biden. The talking points purport to shoot down the “myths” that Trump explicitly made a “mysterious” promise to Zelensky and offered him a “quid pro quo”—as if that is the only possible misconduct. The White House messaging does not address the incriminating remark: Trump, in response to Zelensky’s request for more missiles, asking for a “favor” and noting this was “important.” And, as to be expected, the talking points claim this new scandal is yet another “Deep State” attack on Trump, a conspiracy assisted by the media and congressional Democrats.
All this noise from Trump and his minions is gaslighting. Trump is denying the reality of the memo. His handmaids within the GOP and the conservative media are marching in lockstep. They’re all on the same page: no direct quid pro quo in the conversation means no wrongdoing. It’s the same line as no collusion with Russia’s plot means no wrongdoing. Democrats and many reporters and media commentators got rolled by that spin during the Russia scandal. They and the citizenry of the United States should not fall for it again. Just as with the Russia affair, Trump has been caught red-handed. There is more to learn about the Ukraine scandal; it extends beyond this one phone call. But Trump himself has put his brazen misconduct on full public display. Now he is resorting to his familiar playbook: con the public. It has worked before. And as the House Democrats move ahead with impeachment, a critical question for the nation will be whether Trump and the Republicans can once again pull off this trickery.

What will today bring? Here are the latest developments in the impeachapalooza.
7:10 p.m. ET: A new report indicates that discussing Biden was a precondition for the call. An advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told ABC News that it “was clear that [President Donald] Trump will only have communications if they will discuss the Biden case.”

6:20 p.m. ET: NBC News is reporting that 218 of the 435 House members support some type of action regarding impeachment; 218 House votes are needed to impeach President Trump.

5:27 p.m. ET: The House Intelligence Committee has reviewed the whistleblower’s complaint, and its members say it’s as bad as everyone is making it out to be.


Now for the icing on the cake:

5:08 p.m. ET: “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged fellow Democratic leaders in a private meeting Wednesday to keep the impeachment investigation narrowly focused on President Trump and his dealings with the president of Ukraine,” the Washington Post reports, that word “narrowly” landing like the wettest of blankets.
This was probably inevitable, given the political anxieties of the quivering moderates who were instrumental in forcing Pelosi’s hand. These are the Democrats who want the case for impeachment to be mounted on cravenly value-neutral national security grounds. In The Nation, Jeet Heer makes the strategic argument for keeping impeachment clean and simple. But the narrow approach squanders the opportunity offered by impeachment for a fuller reckoning with the president’s crookedness. Ukraine isn’t a singular Trump corruption scandal; it’s the paradigmatic scandal, illuminating the venality running beneath so many of the others—his obstruction, his emoluments, his financial fraud and self-dealing. Earlier this month, before the Ukraine revelations, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) explained to the Post why the House Judiciary Committee was broadening its investigation into the president. Trump, he said, “has treated the office as an extended get-rich-quick scheme.” That’s the story impeachment can tell.
3:43 p.m. ET: Trump made some bizarre comments during a press conference with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. He repeated the incorrect claim that Crowdstrike, the cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Convention to determine whether it had been hacked in 2016, is owned by a Ukrainian. He can’t seem to drop the topic of Hillary Clinton’s emails, saying, “They had 33,000 emails about the wedding of her daughter and yoga. I don’t think so.”
Here’s a thread from our editor-in-chief:

3:06 p.m. ET: The House Intelligence Committee is expected to see the full whistleblower complaint at 4 p.m., according to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).

2:22 p.m. ET: Still confused about what’s going on and how we go here? Listen to a special, breaking news edition of the Mother Jones podcast to hear our Washington, D.C. bureau chief, David Corn, explain the series of events that caused “a tectonic shift on the part of Nancy Pelosi and the House leadership.”
12:53 p.m. ET: If you haven’t already, please take a moment to read this Washington Post story about the freelance Ukrainian diplomacy conducted by one Rudy Giuliani, who seems to be a Margaret Dumont shy of a Marx Brothers movie.
12:35 p.m. ET: It turns out the White House did not want House Democrats to see its talking points memo. See also: Talking Points Memo.

12:15 p.m. ET: Let’s talk talking points. The White House has a few.

11:20 a.m. ET: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has vocally supported impeachment since April 18, calls the White House transcript “worse than we thought.”

10:59 a.m. ET: Harking back to the language used to describe the tape that led to Richard Nixon’s resignation during the Watergate scandal in 1972, presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) calls the Trump memo a “smoking gun.”

10:55 a.m. ET: Our colleague Matt Cohen breaks down some of the complexities of the impeachment investigation in an interview with Michael Conway, an attorney who served as counsel for the US House Judiciary Committee in the impeachment inquiry of Nixon in 1974. One question that’s been on everyone’s mind: What’s the point of impeachment if a Republican-controlled Senate seems likely to acquit Trump of any charges? Here’s Conway’s answer:
10:40 a.m. ET: Hillary Clinton—remember her?—announces on Twitter that she supports impeachment.

But the bombshell memo of Trump’s call with Volodymyr Zelensky, released by the White House Wednesday morning, contained an overlooked comment by the Ukrainian leader that goes to the heart of how the line between the nation’s business and the president’s personal interests has increasingly blurred.
During their 30-minute call on July 25, Zelensky, eager for US military aid to help his country fend off Russian aggression, slavishly kissed up to Trump, praising him for his campaign tactics and saying that “I had an opportunity to learn from you.” As the conversation wound down, Zelensky brought up Trump’s favorite subject—his properties.
“I would like to tell you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United States. Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower,” Zelensky said, according to the non-verbatim memo of their call.
It’s not clear exactly which Trump property Zelensky was referring to—Trump Tower itself is located several blocks south of Central Park, but the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City is directly on the park. In an Instagram post from March 2018, Zelensky can be seen jogging through Central Park with the Trump hotel in the background.

Zelensky, who is speaking Russian in the video, praises the city and says he’s eager to return home but doesn’t mention Trump.
Trump’s properties are never far from his mind—he’s publicly named-dropped them more than 170 times since he became president and has visited Trump-branded properties at least 362 times. And he’s never been shy about trying to insert his properties into diplomatic situations. When Trump traveled to Ireland last year, he attempted to get the Irish prime minister to pose for photos with him at his resort in Doonbeg—the prime minister refused. Trump has also praised his properties at events with world leaders like Theresa May. At the most recent G7 conference in France, he promoted his own Florida resort as the best location for next year’s summit.
Trump’s Washington, DC, hotel has become a frequent destination for foreign diplomats seeking to curry favor with the White House—representatives of at least 28 countries have stayed at the hotel. Countries such as Saudi Arabia have spent lavishly at the property amid efforts to lobby the administration.
Despite warnings of the conflicts of interest that could result if Trump didn’t divest himself from his business empire, Trump refused to give up any ownership of his properties. The predictable outcome is the appearance—if not the reality—that Trump is profiting from the presidency.

https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/09/crowdstrike-ukraine/,2019-09-25,,,politics,"September 25, 2019",Beyond Biden: Trump Also Pushed Ukraine to Investigate Conspiracies About 2016 Hacking,AJ Vicens,MotherJones,Politics,"The White House released a memorandum memorializing a July phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday, hoping it would show that the president’s self-admitted effort to get the government of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden wasn’t nearly as bad as preliminary reporting based on a whistleblower complaint had made it sound.
While the document largely substantiated the whistleblower’s alleged complaint, it also revealed that Trump had pressed Zelensky to investigate CrowdStrike, a private cyber security firm that the Democratic National Committee hired in 2016 to probe whether it had been hacked, and that Trump incorrectly suggested is owned by a Ukrainian. The request was an outgrowth of his longstanding grievances over the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, and her emails.
Despite the US intelligence community’s 2017 finding that the Russian government orchestrated the infiltration of the Democratic National Committee, some of the president’s supporters have long claimed CrowdStrike’s founders, Shawn Henry and Dmitry Alperovitch, were involved in a plot to manufacture a fake Russian hack to divert attention from a Clinton loss or to strengthen public perceptions about Trump’s Russia connections. Proponents of the theory posit that the DNC and CrowdStrike never allowed the FBI to independently verify CrowdStrike’s findings about Russian hacking. In June, a senior Justice Department lawyer said the department had in fact done so.
“With regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI,” CrowdStrike said in a statement following the document’s release. “As we’ve stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community.”
The two leaders’ exchange about the company came not long after Trump had twice emphasized the US’s “very very good” support for Ukraine, and complained about a lack of reciprocity in the relationship, and immediately after Zelensky spoke about his country’s desire to purchase US made weapons. Trump then asked Zelensky for a favor:
Zelensky didn’t directly respond to the CrowdStrike reference, instead pivoting to an assurance that Ukraine would work to “open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine.”
Trump has previously discussed the company in public, associating it with supposed malfeasance by Clinton and the Democrats. He brought it up in an interview with the Associated Press in April 2017, falsely claiming it was based in Ukraine.
Jessie K. Liu, the Trump appointed US Attorney for the District of Columbia, shot down this notion in June of this year, asserting in court that the Department of Justice had “independently verified” CrowdStrike’s findings. It’s unclear where Trump may have gotten the notion the company is Ukrainian owned or based, or that a computer server relevant to its investigation could be in that country. While Alperovitch was born in Moscow, conspiracists have suggested his role as a fellow at the Atlantic Council and that think tank’s history of funding from Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk—who has also donated to the Clinton Foundation—represent significant connections between the California company and the Eastern European country.
On Wednesday, Trump was asked if he believed Hillary Clinton’s emails were specifically located in Ukraine, responding “I think they could be.”
CrowdStrike was founded in 2011, but first came to wide public attention in June 2016, after the DNC announced it had been hacked in a Washington Post story. CrowdStrike’s investigation into the breach, released that month, found two sophisticated Russian military or intelligence hacking operations within the DNC’s network, one lasting a matter of months, the other going back at least a year. The operations, which incorporated basic spear phishing attacks into a broader and more sophisticated operation, also targeted Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Emails and documents taken from all three were later publicized via WikiLeaks, on DCLeaks.com, and through the Guccifer 2.0 persona on Twitter and a WordPress blog.
The Russian hacking operation was central to question of whether Trump and his associates conspired with the Russian government and a key investigative focus of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose office indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers, charging them with carrying out the country’s operations targeting the 2016 elections.

Listen to Mother Jones Washington Bureau Chief David Corn explain what happens next in the Trump-Ukraine scandal in a special impeachment edition of the Mother Jones Podcast:
This article has been updated to include Trump’s Wednesday comments.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z
https://www.motherjones.com/sitemap-39.xml,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/09/4-bombshells-from-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president/,2019-09-25,,,politics,"September 25, 2019",4 Bombshells From Trump’s Call With Ukraine’s President,Dan Spinelli,MotherJones,Politics,"A five-page memo recounting President Donald Trump’s July 25 call with the leader of Ukraine was released by the White House Wednesday morning, adding new fuel to the scandal surrounding Trump’s efforts to pressure the eastern European country to launch an investigation into Joe Biden.
Trump, who is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, agreed Tuesday to release the memo. A disclaimer on the document notes that it is not necessarily a “verbatim transcript” but is based on “the notes and recollections” of staffers assigned to monitor the conversation. (The New York Times cited senior administration officials who “said voice recognition software was used in preparing the document.”)
Trump’s request to have Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, open an investigation into a political rival is reportedly the central component of a secret whistleblower complaint into his conduct. The administration has refused to turn over the complaint to Congress, apparently in violation of the law. The controversy has roiled the federal government in recent weeks and paved the way for House Democrats to formally launch an impeachment inquiry Tuesday.
Trump’s focus on Biden was not the only troubling aspect of the call, which also touched on arms sales, special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, and Zelensky’s decision to stay at a Trump property when visiting New York. Here are the four most explosive parts of their call:
During the call with Zelensky, which took place just one day after Mueller testified before Congress, Trump urged the Ukrainian president to coordinate with Attorney General Bill Barr and Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, to investigate Biden, one of the front-runners for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. More to the point, Trump did this just days after freezing $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. (The Justice Department said Wednesday that Trump had not asked Barr to contact Ukraine and that Barr had not done so.)
“There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,” Trump said. “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it…It sounds horrible to me.”
Trump was referencing a discredited theory, long promoted by Giuliani, that Biden in 2016 urged Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, because of a state-run investigation into an energy company where Biden’s son, Hunter, was a board member. That investigation did not turn up any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden and was dormant by the time Biden pushed for the prosecutor general’s ouster. As the Washington Post noted in May, Biden’s effort to remove the prosecutor “was part of a longer push by the United States, Western allies and nongovernmental organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank” intended to “promote reform in Ukraine and remove a prosecutor who allegedly was turning a blind eye to corruption.”
Despite the complete absence of evidence that Joe Biden acted improperly, Zelensky said on the call that Ukraine’s new prosecutor “will look into the situation, specifically to the company” mentioned by Trump.
Throughout the call, Trump frequently mentioned Giuliani, calling him a “highly respected man” and a “great mayor.” Giuliani has spent months urging journalists to look into Hunter Biden’s work in Ukraine and also recently spoke with one of Zelensky’s aides, according to the call memo released Wednesday. “One of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine,” Zelensky told Trump.
The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Giuliani has been “more directly involved at nearly every stage of the entanglement with Ukraine” than other Trump advisers. Much of Trump’s national security team has been effectively sidelined on Ukrainian policy. According to the Post, even then-national security adviser John Bolton was “outraged by the outsourcing of a relationship with a country struggling to survive Russian aggression, officials said.”
The role of Trump’s personal attorney in the highly sensitive Ukraine relationship is unusual enough, as was Zelensky’s boast during the call that he stayed at a Trump property while visiting New York. But perhaps even more remarkable was the revelation Wednesday that Trump asked Zelensky to discuss the politically motivated investigations with Barr. In essence, it suggests that Trump views the US attorney general as another one of his personal lawyers and the Justice Department as an extension of his political operation.
“I would like [Giuliani] to call you,” Trump told Zelensky. “I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy.”
Trump’s fixation on Biden betrays a fear of his own vulnerability in 2020, but the president’s other comments to Zelensky show he clearly has not gotten over the controversy surrounding the 2016 election, in which he benefited from a systematic Russian interference effort.
Near the start of the call, Trump asked Zelensky to “do us a favor” by working with Barr to find out “what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike…The server, they say Ukraine has it.” CrowdStrike is the cybersecurity firm that initially identified Russian hacker groups as the culprits behind the theft of emails from Democratic National Committee in 2016. Trump appeared to be referencing an elaborate conspiracy theory alleging, falsely, that CrowdStrike had fabricated evidence of the Russian hack. In other words, it appears that Trump may still be refusing to accept the US intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia hacked the DNC to benefit his campaign.
Trump also told Zelensky that “a lot” of Mueller’s investigation “started with Ukraine”—likely a reference to the case against former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, who was convicted on charges relating to his consulting work for Ukrainian politicians. “Whatever you can do,” Trump added to Zelensky, “it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”
Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama, wrote on Twitter that the exchange suggests Trump “and his team are still trying to relitigate/undermine the Mueller report and Russian interference in the 2016 election.”
Near the beginning of the call, the Ukrainian leader referred to his country’s purchase of US-made Javelin missiles. “We are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes,” Zelensky told Trump.
This statement is striking for two reasons: First, Trump has frequently commended countries such as Saudi Arabia and Vietnam for buying American weapon systems and has even suggested these defense purchases help mitigate unsavory actions like the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Zelensky evidently knows how important these commitments are to Trump.
Second, Ukraine is so dependent on these sophisticated missiles that last year, when the Trump administration was close to approving a previous sale of Javelins, Ukrainian officials halted several investigations relating to Manafort and withdrew an offer to participate in the Mueller investigation. “The cases are just too sensitive for a government deeply reliant on United States financial and military aid,” the New York Times reported at the time, citing Ukrainian lawmakers.
Given Trump’s knowledge of this situation, and his decision to block millions of dollars in military aid just days before the conversation with Zelensky, his next words were especially telling. After Zelensky mentioned the Javelins, Trump began his litany of requests regarding CrowdStrike and Mueller with these words: “I would like you to do us a favor though.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

How Did We Get Here?,Abigail Weinberg,MotherJones,Politics,"In a special, breaking-news edition of the Mother Jones podcast taped on Tuesday, our Washington, DC, bureau chief David Corn walks host Jamilah King through the series of events that led to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s historic decision Tuesday to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The move, Corn says, represents “a tectonic shift on the part of Nancy Pelosi and the House leadership.” Also on the podcast, national security reporter Dan Friedman breaks down what we know and what we don’t know about the whistleblower complaint that set the impeachment discussions in motion. Listen to the podcast below, or read a lightly edited transcript—not a memo—of the show.
Jamilah King: It’s happening: Impeachment hearings against the president of the United States.

How a secret whistleblower complaint against Donald Trump rapidly transformed from a trickle of news into a full blown torrent that finally broke the dam. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s historic announcement. Trump’s presidency heading into one hell of a storm. Why now and what’s next? Everything you need to know.
The spark that set this fire ablaze was an intelligence community whistleblower complaint that Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to open a corruption investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Congress still hasn’t seen that complaint. And Trump’s stonewalling appears to have pushed Pelosi to act. You’ll hear about the origins of the whistleblower complaint soon. But let’s get straight to this announcement.
Mother Jones’ Washington, DC, bureau chief David Corn is joining me right now from MSNBC, where he’s about to go live. David, I mean, where to start? What a day.
David Corn: What a day. It’s not a surprise for us to reach this point. It was not very pretty. How it got reached, a lot of infighting in the Democratic Party. A lot of concern among Democratic activists and commentators, among people concerned with the republic about what was the proper way to go in terms of impeachment, in terms of dealing with Donald Trump, and not just one, two, three, four or five scandals, but a multitude of scandals, beginning with the original sin of how he betrayed the country by basically encouraging the Russian attack and providing cover for the Russian attack on the election in 2016.
David, it sounds odd to say, given all that Trump has done almost dare Congress to impeach. But in this instance, this all seemed to happen pretty quickly?
Well, this is a pretty classic case of a tipping point. For a long time, from the beginning of the presidency, there were well-founded arguments for impeaching Donald Trump. There were well-founded political arguments for focusing on oversight and telling the story of his corruption rather than rushing ahead with impeachment, which would be kind of like going to DEFCON 1: It would make it harder to tell the story of Donald Trump’s corruptions and scandals and controversies if you’re fighting over the big issue of impeachment.
So, that’s been—there’s been a lot of back and forth for months, for over a year now. Yet we finally had the straw that broke the camel’s back, though I hate to use a cliché here: the whole Trump-Russia-Ukrainian scandal, which, according to what we know as of now, seems to have been a case of great brazen abuse of power, in which he leaned on the president of another country to produce opposition research that would be helpful to him in his campaign for re-election. It may or may not be a crime depending what happened. But it is certainly immoral and an abuse of power. And it seems as if it’s a pretty clear-cut case, and they are covering up by trying to keep an intelligence community report on this from Congress even though under the law it has to be produced to Congress. And at this stage of the game, when the Trump administration is stonewalling on so many other fronts and so many other investigations, including getting his tax returns, including emoluments, including obstruction of justice related to the Trump-Russia investigation, I think finally Nancy Pelosi saw that there’s no other remedy here; you know, they can take him to court only so many times, and try to force him to abide by the norms of U.S. government, and not get anything out of that before they have to go for the extreme remedy of an impeachment inquiry.
Now we have to remember, it’s an impeachment inquiry. It’s not a vote yet to impeach him. And then when it comes to that key issue of a vote, there are 177 Democrats now who basically voiced their support for impeachment. [Editor’s note: It’s up to 208 as of 2 p.m. Wednesday.] How many votes do you need to pass this? 218. So Nancy Pelosi right now is 41 votes short, at least in terms of public declarations. Now, what could be worse for the Democrats than to bring forward an impeachment vote and have it not succeed because you don’t have enough Democrats? There are 31 Democrats who come from districts, congressional districts, where Trump won the vote last time, and a lot of these members have been saying to Nancy Pelosi that they don’t want to be forced to vote on impeachment. That is to vote to toss out the guy who most of their constituents elected president. But there’s been some shifting in recent days there. So she still has a bit of a political task ahead of her if the impeachment inquiry leads to an impeachment vote—that is, a vote on articles of impeachment to send over to the Senate. She still needs 41 more Democrats than she currently has.
But you’re saying, there’s real momentum here to close the deal no matter what happens now?
There’s momentum to move ahead with what they are officially calling an impeachment inquiry. Now, how different is this going to be than what they were doing to begin with? Well, they already were investigating Trump on obstruction of justice. It was clear the Ukraine issue was going to be part of a congressional investigation. They’re investigating his tax returns, investigating the emoluments—that is basically institutionalized bribery or potential bribery of foreign governments and individuals giving money directly to Trump through his business. So all these things are being investigated over the course of six different committees. So these investigations will continue, now under the umbrella of an impeachment inquiry. And so ultimately I guess the process—we don’t have all the details yet—will be that these committees will come to some conclusions on the basis of their investigations and funnel those conclusions in terms of whether they have found what they believe are impeachable offenses to the House Judiciary Committee, which would be the committee in charge in most cases of moving forward with articles of impeachment. So there’s not a lot of change in terms of what is being done, but the name of all this changes, and that is indeed a tectonic shift on the part of Nancy Pelosi and the House leadership.
Pelosi said earlier on Tuesday that it doesn’t matter if Trump offered Ukraine anything in exchange for investigating former Vice President Joe Biden. I presume that may be Trump’s main defense here. Is that right?
They’ve already said that there was no quid pro quo explicitly offered in this phone call, which is why Trump is talking about releasing the transcript of the phone call. But we do know that he pressed the Ukrainians to deal with Rudy Giuliani to come up with dirt on Joe Biden. And it does seem as if Trump in some ways made a suggestion that that should be done in his phone call with the Ukrainian president. [Editor’s note: He did indeed, as notes of the phone call reveal.] We may learn more on this come tomorrow. But nevertheless, even if the president did not go through a direct quid pro quo, if he held up aid to Ukraine, which he did, Ukrainians know the aid is being held up. And then if he calls them and says, “I want you to produce dirt on a political opponent,” I mean, this is not too hard for them to see what’s going on!
And just asking a foreign government to give you opposition dirt on your opponent while you are holding up aid to them—this is not like it has to be spelled out! Michael Cohen told us when he testified that Trump doesn’t always tell you what to do, but he tells you what to do. It’s just not explicitly. Like, you know you have a good story to tell. Go tell that story. Well, Michael Cohen knew what that meant when Trump told him these things. So it may not explicitly say, “Listen, I will do this if you do that,” just in the same way that Trump did not explicitly collude with Russian hackers to break into the DNC servers. But when he’s saying publicly to Russia, “I hope you hacked Hillary Clinton,” and when his people are meeting with Russian emissaries secretly to get dirt from Moscow to help his campaign, all these things are sending a message to the other side: “I want your help. And we have a conspiracy here. We’re just not going to talk about it explicitly.”
Trump has just tweeted, David. Here’s what he says that backs up exactly what you are saying. “They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total witch hunt. Presidential harassment.” This is what Trump is saying. What do you make that?
Well, you know, nothing he says is true. Nothing he says is true. He called the Russian inquiry a total witch hunt and the Mueller report talked about how he lied about the Russian attack to cover up and start to benefit from it. So basically— Mueller was too polite to say this—Trump committed an act of betrayal against the United States while running for president. So this is the playbook. It unfortunately, in a lot of ways, worked on the Trump-Russia scandal. He made it seem messy. He got his people and Fox News and all the conservative commentary and Republicans to buy into this witch hunt, hoax, harassment BS. So he’s going to try that again. We don’t know what the transcript says, but we do know that there are other people to talk to. We do know that Chris Murphy, a senator from Connecticut, a Democratic senator, says that he spoke to the president of Ukraine, who said that he felt pressured by Trump.
Trump kept trying to say, “If there’s no evidence of direct collusion in the Trump-Russia scandal, there’s nothing wrong!” He’s going to try to do that here. And this time, I hope the media and Democrats don’t fall into that trap.
So are Republicans just going to keep following this Trump script or do you see any reason that they will finally break off?
I don’t know. Mitch McConnell, shortly before Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry, basically agreed to a Democratic initiative in the Senate to get a copy of the intelligence community report on this from the inspector general. I don’t know if this is Mitch McConnell being nervous or if he has something up his sleeve. They’ve announced a bipartisan investigation on the Senate side into the Trump-Ukraine controversy. Now, there has been a bipartisan intelligence committee investigation of the Trump-Russia scandal on the Senate and it’s produced nothing. I mean it basically was a stall job. So it’s hard to tell at this moment in time if there is a real shift or if McConnell and the Republicans are being a little bit crafty in some way here. We don’t know, but if I were in the Trump White House, I would look at all this and say, “You know what? There’s a possibility that Republicans may not stick with us on this.” Now am I Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber saying, “There’s a chance, there’s a chance!” because it’s a one-in-a-million chance? I don’t know, but maybe, it’s a three-, four-, or five-in-a-million chance.
Finally, David, the common concern I hear is that this will suck up oxygen from the 2020 campaign. Where do you stand on that?
You can judge candidates by how they deal with what’s happening in the real world. Now, there’s only a few months left—weeks almost—in this session of Congress before they break; they come back probably at the very start of the primaries. So there’ll be plenty of time for the Democrats still to fight amongst themselves. And they’re doing the hard work on the ground in the key states. So I don’t think this really will get in the way.
Joining me now is Dan Friedman, who covers foreign influence and national security for Mother Jones in our D.C. bureau. Dan, let’s go back to the beginning of this whole thing. What do we know about the whistleblower complaint and how it came to be?
Dan Friedman: So I believe it was the Friday before last, September 13th, which happened to be Constitution Day. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, announced that the DNI, the director of National Intelligence, the acting director of National Intelligence, was refusing to turn over to the Intelligence Committee a whistleblower complaint—despite, Schiff said, a very clear statute that said that he had to turn it over to the Intelligence Committee. And through a series of reports it has emerged that that whistleblower complaint relates, at least in part, to Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, and the new president of Ukraine, Zelensky. And specifically, to pressuring Zelensky to help Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, get information on Joe Biden and whether he nefariously tried to get a prosecutor there fired, because it had something allegedly to do with Biden’s son Hunter Biden.
We know that Rudy Giuliani has had a role in this whole bizarre affair including some spectacularly weird TV appearances.

How was the president’s lawyer involved?
Ever since Giuliani left the mayor’s office in New York, he has made a lot of money without a lot of public disclosure from various enterprises giving speeches, as well as providing security consulting and other kinds of legal advice to clients around the world, and one of the places that he’s done business is Ukraine. Giuliani had had some consulting business in Ukraine in 2017 and in 2018, shortly after becoming Trump’s lawyer. He signed on with these two Soviet-born Americans who now live in South Florida who are interested in publicizing information on Biden’s role in getting this prosecutor in Ukraine fired. And he had a bunch of meetings in Ukraine that he has never really shared much information on.
But a couple of things happened possibly as a result of those meetings: One thing is the Ukrainian prosecutors ceased cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller on turning over information about Paul Manafort to Mueller. The other thing that happened is that they—the same prosecutor’s office—announced that they were looking into whether in 2016, when information about Manafort’s secret payments that he was receiving from the Ukrainian government years ago came out in middle of the election, whether that had been improperly released as a way to influence the U.S. election. Both of these things were things that Trump wanted and Giuliani as his lawyer wanted. And Giuliani has said that he wasn’t particularly involved in these pieces of information coming out. But I think there’s reason to wonder if he was starting to try to get the Ukrainian government to understand that they would like—that it would be helpful for their relationship with Trump and the United States if they took these steps.
Once that previous government lost in the election back in the spring, Giuliani seemed to be seeking to convince the new government led by Zelensky to hand over information about Hunter Biden’s involvement with this company and whether Joe Biden had sought to help protect that company from prosecution. There is no evidence at all that any of that happened.
How much stock should listeners put into the kind of things Trump and Giuliani are trying to level at Biden his son right now?
No stock, I would say just about. One reason we shouldn’t put stock in anything that Trump and Giuliani say is because Trump has said repeatedly that Biden wanted this prosecutor fired because the prosecutor was investigating this company on which Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, was on the board. It’s not true that the prosecutor was investigating that company. That investigation was not ongoing at the time. So the sort of foundation of what they’re trying to smear Biden with is untrue. That that is very good reason to discount what they’re saying.
Another big part of this story: Trump reportedly halted a funding package to Ukraine ahead of talking to the president of Ukraine. But he denies there was any quid pro quo here. What’s that aid package?
There’s actually two different aid packages that total, I think, somewhere just short of 400 million dollars. But it’s for military aid and other aid to the Ukrainians so that they can resist or try to resist aggression from Russia, their neighbor to the east. That package was held up just days before Trump made these requests to Zelensky, the Ukrainian president. And really, whether or not the Ukrainians got an explicit request from Trump that if they gave up this information, if they took steps to investigate Biden they would get their money, there’s kind of an inherent coercive position that Trump has, a power that he wields when he has these conversations, that it doesn’t make much difference if he posited an explicit quid pro quo. I think it was pretty clear to the Ukrainians that he had the power to do this kind of thing. So when he was asking for help digging up dirt on Biden, they had great reason to understand that Trump could make life more difficult for them or easier depending on how they responded.
Trump has promised a transcript of the phone call between him and the Ukrainian president in which allegedly Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate Biden. But seeing that would not be the whole picture of what happened, right?
Yeah. The whistleblower complaint deals with more than just this one phone call is, at least as far as we’ve seen in the reporting. It’s a series of communications that he had. And again, Trump wants to say that there was no quid pro quo in this phone call, so therefore it’s all okay. Perfect phone call, he says. But again, the president of the United States has such power over this aid package, it doesn’t matter really if Trump said explicitly in this conversation, “You’re only getting your money if you give me this help.” The Ukrainians knew that that kind of deal was—that Trump could easily make that kind of thing happen or not happen, so they had reason to want to do what he said. So both for the reason that there’s a lot more communications than just this phone call, and because the explicit quid pro quo doesn’t matter, this is kind of a too-little-too-late offer by Trump.
Dan, what are you watching out for next?
I think next we’re gonna find out really soon what’s in this whistleblower complaint. The transcript of the call presumably is gonna be out soon. We shouldn’t necessarily believe Trump, but one way or another I think the details are gonna come out. And the whistleblower complaint: Already, the Senate just voted this evening in a non-binding resolution calling for the White House essentially to turn over the whistleblower complaint to the Senate Intelligence Committee. And given all the reporting that’s happened and how quickly things are happening, I think the whistleblower complaint or many of the details in the whistleblower complaint that we don’t know yet, as well as the transcript of this particular phone call between Trump and Zelensky, are gonna come out ,and we’re gonna know a lot more about the larger context in which this phone call came. And it sure seems like that’s going to happen sooner rather than later.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Why Did DOJ Decline to Investigate It?,Pema Levy,MotherJones,Politics,"As we all now know, the July 25 phone call between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky helped push a member of the intelligence community to file a whistleblower complaint, which now sits at the middle of the quickly evolving Trump-Ukraine scandal and Democrats’ formal impeachment inquiry. We also know that, as the New York Times reported this morning, the director of national intelligence and the inspector general of the intelligence community referred the complaint to the Department of Justice for a possible criminal investigation. At issue is Trump’s request that Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s role in the firing of a prosecutor in Ukraine. The non-verbatim memo of the call, which the White House released Wednesday, plainly shows this ask.
But as the Times reported, the Department of Justice did not move ahead with the complaint:
So the Justice Department, for undisclosed reasons, declined to investigate the issue, even though Trump’s request of Zelensky was likely a crime. Federal campaign finance law prohibits anyone from soliciting any “thing of value” from a foreign national. And while the Justice Department seems to disagree, many experts believe that dirt on a political rival counts as a thing of value.
“There’s very clear evidence, as reflected in the memo of the call, that President Trump specifically asked the president of Ukraine to help in the process of digging up dirt on Joe Biden,” says Elliot Mincberg, a former chief counsel for oversight and investigations of the House Judiciary Committee, who is now a senior fellow at a liberal advocacy group People for the American Way. “That is clearly asking a foreign national to provide something of value to his campaign and that’s illegal under federal law.”
This feels something like deja vu. Donald Trump Jr. also welcomed a “thing of value” from a foreign national in 2016. When he received an email from an acquaintance, Rob Goldstone, dangling that the “Crown prosecutor of Russia” had “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary,” Trump Jr. replied, “If it’s what you say I love it.” He subsequently met with the prosecutor in Trump Tower.
This episode presented special counsel Robert Mueller with the same question Justice Department lawyers just considered with President Trump. Mueller declined to bring campaign finance charges against Trump Jr. for multiple reasons, but unlike the Justice Department’s conclusions on President Trump’s ask of the Ukrainian president, Mueller did acknowledge that opposition research on a political opponent may be a “thing of value” under the law. “A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision of funds, but also by the provision of derogatory information about an opponent,” Mueller explained in his report. “Political campaigns frequently conduct and pay for opposition research.”
“The best legal argument is that Trump committed a campaign finance crime if he solicited dirt on Biden and his son, as appears to be the case, regardless of whether there was any quid pro quo,” election law expert Rick Hasen wrote at Slate. Still, Mueller’s refusal to prosecute the son may have emboldened the father to repeat the same campaign finance crime—and made it harder for the Justice Department to prosecute it.
The decision by the Justice Department to dismiss the referral will likely come under scrutiny from Congress as the scandal morphs into one featuring the Justice Department and Attorney General William Barr. On the July 25 call, Trump mentioned multiple times that he would have Barr personally call Zelensky about investigations Trump wanted Ukraine to undertake. Yet Barr has not recused himself from the possible criminal probe arising from this call, and it’s unknown at this point if he had anything to do with the decision not to investigate it. The Justice Department denies that Barr spoke with Zelensky. The Justice Department had also been instrumental in preventing the release of the whistleblower complaint underlying the current scandal to Congress, making Barr a major obstacle to shedding more light on what actually happened between the Trump administration, Trump’s allies, and the government of Ukraine. (The whistleblower complaint was finally released Wednesday to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.) While there are a lot of unknowns, the outlines of the problems for Barr are clear: His agency has kept the details of the scandal from Congress in likely violation of the law, and it declined to investigate a possible crime that Barr himself may be a witness to or implicated in.
There’s also another reason the Justice Department may have ditched its investigation: Even if it concluded that Trump had broken the law in his call with Zelensky, a sitting president cannot be indicted. But it’s important to remember Trump isn’t the only person possibly implicated in this potential crime. The memo about the July 25 call shows Rudy Giuliani’s involvement in helping Ukraine deliver dirt on Biden. Trump also noted on the call that Barr would get involved. “Rudy Giuliani could be prosecuted for any crimes he’s committed,” campaign finance expert Paul Ryan wrote this week at the legal blog Just Security. Anyone else involved in extracting opposition research from Ukraine in this scheme could as well. Don’t forget that Michael Cohen is currently serving jail time for campaign finance violations that allegedly involved the participation of the president.
Ultimately, the decision to impeach Trump does not turn on whether he violated federal law. The threshold for impeachment is “high crimes and misdemeanors”—a phrase that at the time the Constitution was written referred to, as Alexander Hamilton put it, “the abuse or violation of some public trust.” But as Trump and his allies launch a public relations campaign to exonerate the president in the Ukraine affair, stating that nothing improper occurred, lawmakers considering impeachment might find it helpful to remember that the law pretty clearly states otherwise.

That presidential campaign had included the most significant scandal in the history of the United States. A foreign adversary had covertly interfered to boost the chances of the underdog candidate who won—and that candidate had encouraged this attack; his campaign had secretly signaled to the adversary that it did not mind the intervention; and the candidate and his top aides had repeatedly denied in public that the assault was real, in essence providing cover for the foreign foe seeking to subvert American democracy. This was treachery and betrayal—the stuff that political parties can justifiably exploit, and wrongdoing that legislators have a duty to expose to safeguard the nation. Yet the Democrats have failed to shape a clear narrative regarding the Trump-Russia scandal, and that failure has landed them in the current mess marked by the party’s fierce internal debate over impeachment and its reaction to the latest Donald Trump scandal: his alleged attempt to muscle the Ukrainian president to produce dirt on Joe Biden.
After Hillary Clinton’s loss to Trump, shellshocked Democrats did nothing at first to highlight the critical fact that the election had been undermined by Vladimir Putin’s information warfare—a plot aided and abetted by Trump and his campaign’s brazenly false denials. (The Russian intervention indeed had an effect: In the last month of the race, the near-daily dumping by WikiLeaks of Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian hackers shaped the all-important media coverage of the contest.) Trump and the celebrating Republicans were not going to address this matter. It was up to the Democrats to raise a fuss. But they didn’t. It took weeks for President Barack Obama and the White House to impose sanctions on the Russians. And the leaders of the Capitol Hill Democrats said little about the Russian attack. Shortly after the election, I asked Nancy Pelosi, then the House minority leader, if she intended to push for an investigation. She responded as if the thought had not yet crossed her mind but said it would be a good idea. And it was only in response to questions I submitted to Sen. Chuck Schumer’s office that Schumer, the top Democrat in the upper body of Congress, issued a statement noting that he would support an investigation. Neither was leading a charge at this point—and that means they were not telling the story of Trump’s perfidy when those details and actions were fresh.
Not until two months after the campaign’s finish—following the intelligence community’s release of a report in early January 2017 confirming that Russia had attacked the election in part to benefit Trump, and the publication by BuzzFeed News of the so-called Steele dossier—did the Democrats make a concerted effort to force the Republicans then controlling both houses of Congress to launch investigations. Yet at this stage, the controversy was dominated by the salacious allegations of the Steele memos (blackmail! the pee tape!), not Trump’s treasonous conduct during the campaign. And that provided Trump and his cultists an opening to characterize the Russia scandal as a hoax based on unfounded wild allegations and dismiss the whole thing.
Congressional inquiries were initiated, but the GOPers in charge turned these probes into a circus (in the House) and a stall job (in the Senate). Democrats did voice outrage when Trump engaged in misconduct and spewed lies related to the Russia inquiries. They howled when he fired FBI chief James Comey. They howled when Trump publicly accepted Putin’s denials over the conclusions of the US intelligence community. Yet they did not consistently press the fundamental point: Trump had betrayed the nation during an election influenced by Russia’s clandestine attack. Perhaps fearful of being branded sore losers, they did not advance the theme that Trump’s presidency was tainted and, to some degree, less than fully legitimate.
Admittedly, advancing any theme in a political environment dominated by Trump’s chaos, demagoguery, and lies is a tough task. But there never seemed to be a concerted Democratic effort to cast a big picture of the Trump-Russia scandal and to stick with it. In his never-ending battles with House Republicans, Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, did attempt to keep the scandal alive, but he often seemed an outlier within his party leadership. On the other side of Capitol Hill, Sen. Mark Warner, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, mostly played nice with his fellow Republicans, as that investigation dragged along. And in the months before the midterm elections, according to one prominent House Democrat, Democrats were told that causing a stink about the Trump-Russia scandal was not likely to help Democratic candidates. The issue was kicked to the curb. Perhaps this was the right move, for the Democrats crushed the Republicans and took back the House. But discussion of Trump’s 2016 treachery receded. And the Democrats did not go ballistic when it was revealed that during the 2016 race, Trump, who was then claiming he had nothing to do with Russia, had been secretly pursuing a tower deal in Moscow that could reap him hundreds of millions and that his firm had contacted Putin’s office for help on the project. Of course, Trump continued to deny the scandal was a scandal, calling it “fake news” and denouncing journalists who broke stories on this front as enemies of the people. There was no strong, unified Democratic response to Trump’s disinformation.
The Democrats took the eggs they had and placed them in a basket held by Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed after Trump fired Comey. They waited and waited for the former FBI chief to indict Trump or release a report that would be so searing that it would spark a political uprising across the land and scare the bejeezus out of the Republicans who stood with Trump regardless of his misdeeds. They essentially contracted out the job of holding Trump accountable for the original sin of his presidency: collaborating with the Russian attack on the United States. (Schiff’s promise to revive the House Intelligence Committee’s Trump-Russia investigation and run a robust probe has not yet been fully met.)
When Mueller in March submitted his final report—a damning document that confirmed the Russian attack, that noted that Trump lied about the assault even as he tried to benefit from it, that detailed Trump’s scheme to make a bundle in Russia (with the help of Putin’s office) while running for president, and that chronicled many alleged obstructions of justice committed by Trump—the Democrats were initially outmaneuvered by the Trump administration, with US Attorney General William Barr prior to its release falsely characterizing the report as concluding there was no obstruction or collusion. Yet once the report became public, the Democrats committed their own blunders. They seized on the obstruction issue and concentrated their attention on Barr’s efforts to undermine the report, engaging in a pissing match with the attorney general about the redactions in the report and whether he could be questioned by a committee lawyer, rather than members of Congress, when testifying before the House Judiciary Committee.
All of this was important—but not as important as Trump’s assistance to Russia when it was attacking the United States. The public and voters were less likely to care about Trump obstructing an investigation if they did not fervently care about the topic of that investigation: the Trump-Russia scandal. The back-and-forth with Barr and even the fixation on obstruction distracted attention from the fundamentals of the scandal. And Mueller’s dry and underwhelming appearance before the House Judiciary Committee in July was no gamechanger. The Democrats miscalculated by scheduling Mueller to testify first for hours on obstruction before he would on the same day appear before the House Intelligence Committee to discuss the first volume of the report that honed in on the Russian attack and the Trump campaign. At the start of that second session, Schiff offered a kickass introduction that captured the essence of the scandal:
Disloyalty to country. This was the sort of powerful, visceral, and to-the-point framing that too often has been absent from how Democrats have discussed the Mueller report and the Trump-Russia scandal. Yet it came midway through a long day—and after the news cycle had established Mueller’s testimony on obstruction as the topic du jour. The media coverage did not zero in on Trump’s disloyalty because the Democrats had made obstruction the main item of contention.
It might indeed be hard for some politicians to call a sitting president “disloyal” and argue he has betrayed the nation (though Fox News, some Republican officials, and assorted conservative commentators did not find this a problem during the Obama years). It sounds extreme. But that’s the reality, and if Democrats can’t aim straight at this, fixating on obstruction is not an effective substitute. As significant as that angle is—a president should not be obstructing justice—it relies upon process arguments and legal interpretations that can be debated (yes, in bad faith) ad infinitum. Voters looking on might consider this just another messy Washington dustup.
Which brings us to the present moment. Democrats have been tying themselves in knots over impeachment, with Pelosi and other Democratic leaders apparently at odds with most of the House Democratic caucus and Twitterers demanding impeachment of Trump. (Pelosi has feared that she does not have 218 Democratic votes for impeachment, with a handful of Dems from districts that Trump won not willing to vote to toss him out of the White House. That might be shifting. But the two last things Pelosi wants is to lose an impeachment vote and then lose the House majority if voters in these Trumpy districts turn against their Democratic representatives.) Though it may be too late for told-you-so’s, another path might have placed the Democrats in a less difficult spot (emphasis on might).
The Democrats never made a robust effort to convey the full tale of Trump and the 2016 election. Sure, they took stabs at it. But it rarely seemed to be a priority. During the Democratic presidential debate, none of the leading candidates have broached this topic in a significant manner. And when the Democrats moved into the majority in the House at the start of this year, they did not figure out how to hold high-profile and effective hearings on Trump’s various corruptions—including the Trump-Russia scandal—to create a fierce narrative about his campaign and White House skulduggery. Had they done so, there would be a well-established context for the new Ukraine scandal. A fellow who welcomes a foreign government’s attack on the United States is just the sort who would abuse his power to pressure another government to supply him opposition research on a political foe. This is all crooked and nefarious conduct and some of it could be illegal.
In the months they have controlled the House, Democrats have intermittently taken swings at individual Trump scandals (obstruction, tax returns, Deutsche Bank, Jared Kushner’s security clearance, emoluments, and more), but they have gotten bogged down in the intramural impeachment argument and in details and sideshows (such as tussling with Barr). They have not clearly cast the spotlights they now possess on Trump’s major acts of malfeasance. Moreover, they have not knitted together and presented to the public a full, compelling, and coherent account of Trump’s iniquities—which could have set the table for impeachment proceedings. Instead, the question of impeachment has come to overshadow any oversight effort designed to explain and highlight Trump’s wide-ranging corruption, which, in a way, began with Russia and Trump’s corrupt election victory.
In 2016, Trump made common cause with an enemy engaged in political warfare against the United States—and he has largely gotten away with this and has subsequently put the nation at risk. True, Trump and his Republican handmaids and media confederates have vigorously mounted a vast and never-ending disinformation campaign to bury this truth with distractions, innuendos, counterattacks, and falsehoods. Still, the Democrats overall have not endeavored to make this fundamental element of the Trump presidency a central feature of the ongoing battle. That is both political malpractice and neglect of constitutional duties.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In particular, they looked at affirmative action for four different categories of freshman admits: athletes, legacies, “dean’s interest,” and children of faculty. These are referred to as ALDC admits.
The question at hand is how many applicants who were otherwise unqualified were admitted because of their ALDC status. This is usually shown as a percentage or a distribution, but I think it’s useful to show it as a raw number too. For those who want to follow along, here’s an example for white applicants taken from Table 10 of the paper:
Here are the numbers for all applicants:
It turns out that more than 40 percent of Harvard’s incoming white students from the classes of 2014-19 benefited from their ALDC status compared to about 15 percent for other ethnic groups. As a result, 1,612 otherwise unqualified whites were admitted, triple the number of every other group combined.
Keep this in mind the next time you hear someone complain about affirmative action for black or Hispanic students crowding out better qualified white students. Whatever sort of affirmative action Harvard may have for marginalized groups, the raw numbers come nowhere even close to the preferences they already give to white applicants. And needless to say, there’s no reason to think that Harvard is unique in this regard. This is standard stuff at elite universities across the country. If there’s anyone being screwed by affirmative action, it sure isn’t white kids.
UPDATE: A couple of people have pointed out that I may have left the wrong impression with this post. I didn’t mean to imply that if ALDC preferences were eliminated Harvard would have admitted 1,612 fewer white kids. That’s not the case, and the paper says so. Most of those spots would simply have gone to different, less privileged white kids.
I was just trying to make a narrower point: There are a whole lot of white applicants who benefit from the ALDC preference system, far more than there are minority kids who benefit from affirmative action.
I don’t know if the Harvard data we have would tell us this, but here’s what I’d be interested in: if all the ALDC and racial preferences were removed and replaced with a class-preference system of affirmative action, what would Harvard ‘s entering class look like? It would certainly be less elite, but what would be the racial composition?",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Progressives Are Suspicious.,"Kara Voght,David Corn",MotherJones,Politics,"Update, 5:30 p.m. ET: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday evening that the House will move forward with an impeachment inquiry. Pelosi reportedly decided not to create a select committee specifically to investigate Trump’s Ukraine scandal. Instead, she said she will direct six House committees to “proceed with their investigations under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has so far resisted Democratic calls for impeachment, is considering setting up a select committee to investigate President Donald Trump’s interactions with Ukraine, according to several House sources. Progressive Democrats are concerned that this move might be an attempt to remove the Ukraine scandal—in which Trump allegedly threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine if its government did not investigate former vice president Joe Biden—from the ongoing impeachment inquiry being mounted by the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.).
Some progressives within the House caucus are wondering why Pelosi would not follow a different course: allow the House Intelligence Committee, chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), to probe the Ukraine controversy and then share its findings with Nadler’s committee for possible inclusion into that panel’s consideration of impeachment. Setting up a select committee on this matter, the progressives fear, could distance Nadler—who is more eager to pursue impeachment than Pelosi is—from what could possibly be another foundation for impeachment. “We don’t want Nadler to be sidelined,” said a senior aide to a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the influential group of nearly 100 liberal House Democrats. Nadler’s committee includes many fiery progressives who have been at the forefront of the impeachment push.
Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.), who co-chair the CPC, oppose the creation of a new committee. “A select committee will take a long time,” Jayapal, a member of Judiciary, told reporters Tuesday afternoon.
According to one aide to a member of House leadership, conversations with members and staff suggest that many within the caucus support creating a select committee on the Trump-Ukraine scandal and that many Democrats would like the membership of this new committee to represent the diverse political viewpoints within the caucus. That is, some Democrats see this action as a way to shift a piece of the impeachment story away from Nadler and his progressive-dominated committee.
An aide to a different member of House leadership said the concern wasn’t about the progressives on the Judiciary Committee but instead reflected a lack of confidence in Nadler’s staff to orchestrate a successful impeachment inquiry. Both aides cited the recent Judiciary hearings involving special counsel Robert Mueller and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski as failed attempts to clearly convey allegations against Trump. “We haven’t been able to create a clear message about what we’re doing,” the second aide said. “People don’t have faith in being able to course-correct right now. We need to be able to show the American people that we can take this seriously by holding Trump accountable for his actions.”
Pelosi’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Details on the possible select committee have been sketchy. There has been no word on who would chair the panel or who exactly would be part of it. (Pelosi has the authority to name committee chairs and members.) On Tuesday afternoon, Pelosi is scheduled to huddle with the six committee chairs who have led investigations of the Trump administration and then hold a members-only, closed-door meeting with the entire Democratic caucus to gauge its willingness to proceed with impeachment. This conversation is expected to include consideration of the select committee. Afterward, progressives will presumably be in a better position to determine if there’s a reason to oppose its establishment. The full House would have to vote on a resolution to establish the select committee.

The move comes amid growing support among House Democrats for an impeachment inquiry.
“Our Committees have a constitutional duty to serve as an independent check on the Executive Branch and to determine the facts regarding the actions of the President,” Reps. Adam Schiff of California, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, and Eliot Engel of New York—the heads of the Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees, respectively—wrote in a letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone. “Any attempt by a President to use the office of the presidency of the United States for personal political gain—rather than the national interest—fundamentally undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution.”
According to media reports, Trump may have done just that: tried to enlist another country’s president to investigate a political rival, perhaps by withholding foreign aide. The growing scandal exploded into public view last week in news accounts about a whistleblower complaint regarding the controversy. By law, the administration is likely required to turn that complaint over to Congress, but so far the White House and the Justice Department have refused to do so.
This is the second time that the three Democratic chairmen have demanded documents pertaining to the Ukraine affair. The first request came in a letter on September 9 and gave the White House a seven-day window, which the administration ignored. The requests include a demand for the transcript of a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and records involving aid to Ukraine and about the president’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who has publicly acknowledged his role in pressing for a Ukrainian investigation of Biden.
The White House is used to stonewalling congressional Democrats, who have requested, but not received, the president’s tax returns and other financial records. The White House has also blocked numerous individuals from testifying before Congress, often using dubious legal arguments. Tuesday’s letter doesn’t say what the three chairmen are prepared to do if the documents are again not turned over. It simply states that failure to comply “will compel our Committees to resort to escalated measures.” If the House does ultimately move forward with impeachment, a refusal to turn over information to congressional investigators will likely be part of the case for impeachment.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

John Lewis (D-Ga.) delivered a call action for the House of Representatives on Tuesday to impeach President Donald Trump over the Ukraine scandal.
“We cannot delay. We must not wait. Now is the time to act,” the longtime civil rights leader said on the floor of the House. “We will never find the truth unless we use the power given to the House of Representatives and the House alone to begin an official investigation, as dictated by the Constitution.”
Lewis is one of 156 representatives—155 Democrats and one independent—who support impeachment as of Tuesday. Support for impeachment has grown since Trump admitted to discussing former Vice President and current presidential candidate Joe Biden on a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. Trump insisted that there was “no quid pro quo” in the conversation, but he withheld $391 million in military aid to Ukraine in the days leading up to the call, the Washington Post reports.
Lewis, one of the Big Six civil rights leaders who organized the 1963 March on Washington, voted no on all four articles of impeachment raised against former President Bill Clinton in 1998. Trump’s actions, he said, threaten the future of democracy.
“There comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect and preserve the integrity of our nation,” he said. “I believe I truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come. To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.”

“If he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment,” Biden said. “That will be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.”
As my colleague Inae Oh reported, “Trump on Monday appeared to confirm that he pressured Ukraine to investigate debunked corruption allegations against Joe Biden in exchange for releasing US military aid to the country.”
As Barack Obama’s vice president, Biden called for the top Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, to step down due to his failure to quell corruption in the country, as NPR reports. While Biden was working with Ukraine, his son, Hunter Biden, took a position on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest natural gas company. Trump has accused Biden of having a conflict of interest, but these claims have been disproven.
This week, Trump admitted to having discussed Biden, a potential challenger for the presidency in the 2020 election, during a phone call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
“I can take the political attacks,” Biden said in his Tuesday speech. “They’ll come and they’ll go, and in time, they’ll soon be forgotten. But if we allow a president to get away with shredding the US constitution, that will last forever.”

It’s mostly contained in Table 5 of his report, which is a little hard to read, but here it is:
Even after controlling for economic status, attendance at a school with a big racial attendance gap (i.e., heavily black or heavily white) leads to big differences in black-white achievement scores (0.610). However, once you control for differences in school poverty, the effect goes away (0.013).
What’s left is a big effect in exposure to poor schoolmates (0.924). In other words, this confirms what we’ve known for a long time about the effect of concentrated poverty. If a black student goes go to a school that’s heavily black but middle class, it’s no big deal. But if a black student goes to a school that’s heavily poor, he’s doomed.
Needless to say, schools that are heavily black tend to also be heavily poor, so this effect can be hard to tease out without careful study. Nonetheless, Reardon is clear:
If you want to take away any good news from this, here’s a glimmer of hope: If the problem really is class more than race, then we can make a case for desegregating our schools based on class. According to Reardon, this would actually be more effective, and it’s probably slightly less incendiary than desegregation plans based on race.
This is, to be clear, only the slightest glimmer of hope. Parents of middle-class kids will probably resist integration with poor kids just as much as parents of white kids resist integration with poor kids. But you never know. Anything that turns down the dial a bit could be helpful.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

His “customers,” however, rallied for him. Two sisters started a GoFundMe campaign that has raised about $15,000 for him as of Tuesday. One contributor wrote: “Hassan, although you probably don’t know who I am, you brightened my commute every day!” Another wrote: “You showed more commitment than I do to most things in my life.”

Nezhadessivandi, who came to the United States from Iran in 1978, told Washington Post columnist Theresa Vargas he didn’t expect the support from people who interacted with him for just a few seconds each morning.

On a side note, this should make it easier for Congress to subpoena Trump’s tax returns, shouldn’t it? The Treasury Department has been arguing that Congress doesn’t really have any legislative purpose behind the request, but an impeachment inquiry is unquestionably a legislative purpose. It’s hard to see how they can hold out much longer, or how a court could rule in their favor.
I suppose one of the big questions going forward is how to frame the eventual impeachment charges. Should the House issue multiple articles of impeachment (Comey firing, Stormy Daniels, Ukraine, etc.) and hold extensive hearings on them? Or should they focus tightly on Ukraine and try to get through this fairly quickly? I’m tentatively in favor of the latter. Not only is time short, but Ukrainegate is a nice, bright line. Republicans have already made it clear that they’ll fight all the other stuff, and it’s not clear the public would have a problem with that. But Ukraine?

In a press release, Purdue claimed the settlement would “provide more than $10 billion of value to address the opioid crisis.”
Yet critics argue that the actual amount of assistance would likely be much less—and that a settlement would leave fewer opportunities to understand the company’s role in the crisis while leaving open the possibility that the company’s owners, the Sackler family, continue to profit off of the sale of opioids internationally.
The tentative deal would restructure Purdue in the form of a trust: profits from future domestic OxyContin would be distributed among the plaintiffs as they address the costly consequences of the overdose crisis. The Sacklers would sell Mundipharma, their pharmaceutical company that markets OxyContin and other drugs overseas and would also give $3 billion to the plaintiffs over seven years. That money would either come from the Sacklers’ personal accounts, Mundipharma’s sale, or a combination of the two. Critically, the settlement would halt current and future opioid lawsuits against both Purdue and the Sacklers, both of whom deny any wrongdoing. The details of the deal, which have been reported on but not released publicly, could change over the course of months to come during bankruptcy proceedings, which started last week under White Plains Judge Robert Drain.
Proponents argue that a settlement would avoid a protracted, expensive trial and bring desperately needed money for addiction treatment and other necessary services quickly. So far, plaintiffs in the massive federal litigation—involving thousands of counties, tribal lands, hospital systems, and unions—have agreed to the proposed deal. Nearly every state attorney general has separately sued Purdue, and about half support the deal.
Other state attorneys general have vocally opposed it, with AGs in Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut taking particularly assertive stances. “The Sacklers would like the public to believe they’re cutting a check for billions of dollars,” said Massachusetts AG Maura Healey in a statement. “They’re not. Their proposal, which we believe is worth far less than they say, wouldn’t require them to pay back a dime of the billions they’ve earned from OxyContin sales.” Whether these opposing states will be subject to the settlement is now up to Judge Drain.
Here are the deal’s red flags:
The “$10 billion settlement,” as it’s been described by Purdue and a number of media outlets, isn’t a hard number. The exact settlement amount will depend largely on future pharmaceutical sales—including sales of OxyContin—both in the United States and abroad in the years to come. It also includes the value of overdose reversal drugs that Purdue would contribute in kind. In fact, $10 billion is the best case scenario: the current deal only guarantees $4.4 billion in cash, according to sources familiar with the proposal.
There is precedent for forming a trust as part of a settlement: tobacco companies paid have billions to states out of annual revenues as a result of the 1998 Big Tobacco settlement (though a relatively small portion has gone towards tobacco prevention efforts). “There are many cases without enough money to go around and where claimants will need relief for a long time,” explained Lindsey Simon, a law professor at the University of Georgia focusing on bankruptcy. The solution: “Put all the claims and all the assets in one place and put someone in control of it.”
But critics argue that funding the response to the opioid crisis by selling more opioids creates perverse incentives. In recent years, Mundipharma, which boasts revenues in excess of $1 billion, has been accused of promoting OxyContin abroad using the same tactics as it did in the United States. A 2016 Los Angeles Times investigation described the company as “moving rapidly into Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and other regions, and pushing for broad use of painkillers in places ill-prepared to deal with the ravages of opioid abuse and addiction.” Promotional videos for the company, according to the article, “feature smiling people of many ethnicities, suggest the companies regard OxyContin’s U.S. success as merely a beginning.”
Under the proposed settlement, the Sacklers would pay a guaranteed $3 billion to the plaintiffs, and roughly $1.5 billion more if Mundipharma sells for more than $4.5 billion. Above the $4.5 billion threshold, the plaintiffs and the Sacklers would split the profits equally.
The initial $3 billion would make up the bulk of the guaranteed cash to the plaintiffs, because Purdue itself has little in the way of assets other than ownership of OxyContin. The Sacklers, meanwhile, are among the richest families in America. According to lawsuits in Oregon and Massachusetts, the family transferred between $4 and $10 billion from the company to personal accounts over the past decade. This transfer appears to have been part of a long term plan. As the Washington Post recently reported, in 2008, Purdue board member advised Purdue chief executive Richard Sackler, “In the event that a favorable [recapitalization] deal cannot be structured during 2008, the most certain way for the owners to diversify their risk is to distribute more free cash flow to themselves.”
More evidence of this plan surfaced last week, when New York Attorney General Letitia James alleged a new $1 billion transfer, including through Swiss bank accounts, from Purdue to Sackler family members. The finding turned up in response to a subpoena—one of 33 subpoenas that James issued last month to financial institutions and advisers used by the Sacklers in an effort to understand the full extent of the family’s wealth, which Forbes estimates to be worth $13.5 billion. It’s unclear if the results of the other 32 subpoenas will see the light of day, as the Sacklers recently filed a motion to quash them.
State attorneys general have more than money on the line: they they want to be able to show their constituents that they won big in the fight on opioids. So far, support for the settlement largely falls on partisan lines. With a handful of exceptions, Republican AGs support the settlement, and Democratic AGs do not. There could be a number of reasons behind the split. The AP recently noted Purdue’s historic support of Republican Attorneys General Association: $680,000 to the group between 2014 and 2018, compared to $210,000 to the group’s democratic counterpart.
In addition, many of the states rejecting the settlement have sued the Sackler family separately from Purdue, and so have more to lose in the event that a settlement deal halts suits against the family. Meanwhile, many of the states and localities agreeing to the settlement are represented by private firms—including some of the same firms that represented them during the Big Tobacco settlement. They are, in a way, following the Big Tobacco paradigm: File a suit, gather as much money as possible in a settlement, and move on. “Our goal has always been to bring desperately needed resources into local communities that, for years, have been forced to shoulder the devastating consequences and financial burden,” said Paul Hanly, the lawyer representing the federal lawsuit plaintiffs.
AG Healey sees it differently: “The settlement would be funded almost entirely by future sales of dangerous and addictive opioids. I find that deeply offensive, and it certainly doesn’t qualify as accountability in my book.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

He’s Spent the Last 3 Years in Trump’s Swamp.,Dan Friedman,MotherJones,Politics,"Halfway through the fourth hour of Corey Lewandowski’s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee last week, Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) asked the former Trump campaign manager about his work since the 2016 election. By and large, that work appears to have entailed selling his perceived access to President Donald Trump.
“It was very important that you maintain a good relationship with the president because, after you left the Trump campaign in December 2016, you co-founded Avenue Strategies,” Dean said, referring to a lobbying shop Lewandowski worked for until May 2017. “Isn’t that right?”
“Yes, it is,” responded Lewandowski, who has said he may run for the GOP nomination to take on New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D) in 2020.
Earlier in the hearing, Lewandowski confirmed special counsel Robert Mueller’s finding that in 2018, Trump had requested that Lewandowski, a private citizen, pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to hobble Mueller’s Russia investigation. Though Lewandowski said he never delivered Trump’s message, Mueller said that the incident met the criteria for obstruction of justice.
Dean was the first lawmaker at the hearing to note that Lewandowski’s day job made it hard for him to rebuff Trump’s request. “You had access to him that others didn’t,” she said. “It was important to you, wasn’t it?”
Lewandowski replied, unconvincingly, that access was not important to him. But the exchange highlighted a connection between Trump’s efforts to impede Mueller’s investigation and the sale of influence by Trump insiders in Washington. In exchange for access, Trump wants favors.
Lewandowski denies that he has acted as a lobbyist. He has even denied cashing in on his connection to Trump. He has refused to detail his work for corporate and foreign clients, and he says he won’t reveal his “private business” if he runs for office.
But Dean’s questions, along with Lewandowski’s potential Senate bid, are prompting new scrutiny of what critics call his shadow lobbying career. Trump has indicated support for a Lewandowski run and exchanged encouraging tweets with him during the hearing. For their part, New Hampshire Democrats have started attacking Lewandowski as a swamp creature.
“Corey Lewandowski has spent every minute since the 2016 election selling White House access to the highest bidders and most nefarious clients imaginable, from predatory lenders to big oil and even foreign interests,” said Josh Marcus-Blank, a spokesman for New Hampshire Democrats.
Media reports have already revealed that the former Trump aide has distinguished himself for the brazenness with which he has reportedly touted his ability to access and influence Trump. Without registering as a lobbyist, he has associated himself with lobbying firms and created the impression that by hiring them, clients will benefit from his ties to Trump. He won’t say how much he earned this way, but he is not working pro bono. Along the way, he has advised firms ranging from T-Mobile—which was seeking help winning approval for its proposed merger with Sprint—to Elio Motors, which sells a three-wheeled “autocycle.” He’s met with foreign leaders from the Balkans, Poland, and elsewhere. And he’s done all this while dismissing reports that he is selling influence as fake news.
Lewandowski formed Avenue Strategies during the presidential transition period. In December 2016, he traveled to Mexico City. Media reports credited him with setting up a private meeting with Trump for Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. Lewandowski claimed the firm was not auditioning to represent Slim, but Lewandowski’s partner at Avenue, Barry Bennett, has said the company was indeed interested in signing Slim as a client.
In early 2017, another company founded by Lewandowski and Bennett told foreign leaders in written pitches that it could arrange meetings with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and other “key members” of the administration. Lewandowksi, while seeking business, reportedly told Azerbaijan’s ambassador that he could arrange for that country’s notoriously corrupt and autocratic president to meet with Trump.
The New York Times reported in 2017 that Lewandowski told potential clients that he could help corporate clients avoid being attacked by Trump on Twitter. At Tuesdays hearing, Lewandowski denied a 2017 Buzzfeed report that he had told Facebook and the Blackstone Group that he had access to Trump’s Twitter account. (During the same hearing, Lewandowski also admitted to lying to the media.)
After leaving Avenue amid bad press and an acrimonious split with his partners, Lewandowski agreed to represent a payday lender called Community Choice Financial. While working for that firm, he made a July 2017 appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, during which he urged Trump to fire the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, who supported new regulations on payday lenders. On the show, Lewandowski falsely claimed that this unprompted suggestion did not reflect “any business interests.” He did not deny these facts at the hearing, but he did dispute a GQ report that, as part of his effort to convince the company to hire him, he had had promised he could get Cordray fired. Under pressure to quit, Cordray left the agency in late 2017 to run unsuccessfully for governor of Ohio. After his departure, the agency quickly rolled backed restrictions on payday lenders.
Lewandowski reportedly began working in mid-2017 with Turnberry Solutions, a firm run by former Trump aides and named after a Trump-owned golf resort in Scotland. (Last week, the House Oversight Committee revealed that the Air Force has spent $184,000 at the resort during Trump’s presidency.) In 2017 and 2018, Lewandowski consistently denied any financial connection to the firm, despite living in a townhouse where the company is headquartered; reportedly joining the firm’s lobbyists on business calls; and traveling with registered lobbyists for the firm to locations including Poland and Serbia, where they met with lawmakers. Lewandowski reportedly helped another firm, BGR, sign a group of Polish defense contractor as clients.
In May 2018, T-Mobile hired Turnberry and announced that Lewandowski was advising them on the Sprint merger push. The Wall Street Journal reported that Lewandowski was receiving a cut of fees T-Mobile paid the firm. Jason Osborne, a Turnberry partner, claimed at the time that Lewandowski was an unpaid “strategic adviser.” Lewandowski did not respond to a request for comment.
In the summer of 2018, two Turnberry lobbyists agreed to represent a political party from Rebublika Srpska, a Serbian enclave in Bosnia. When the party’s prime minister visited the United States, she met with Lewandowski in Trump’s Washington hotel and later issued a press release showing them together. Osborne, who calls Lewandowski a “close friend,” told Mother Jones that meeting was unplanned.
In February, Lewandowski officially joined Turnberry as an adviser. That gave him a formal tie to clients, including the Houston-based American Ethane Company. American Ethane wanted members of Congress to help pressure a Chinese textile giant, the Nanshan Group, to fulfill a deal it appeared to agree to in 2017 to buy $26 billion worth of ethane from the company over 20 years. American Ethane is owned by two Russian billionaires. One of them, Konstantin Nikolaev, was revealed by the Washington Post last year to have funded efforts by Maria Butina, a founder of a Russian pro-gun group, to cultivate ties to prominent Republicans and National Rifle Association officials. Butina pleaded guilty last year to acting as unregistered agent for Russia. Osborne told Mother Jones that Turnberry’s work had nothing to do with Butina or Russia.
Lewandowski’s work for such companies does not appear have have hurt his standing at the White House. “The president respects loyalty, and Corey has been extremely loyal to him through thick and thin,” Chris Ruddy, a Trump friend and adviser, told the New York Times in 2017. “As long as that continues to be the case, the president is going to be supportive of Corey.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The world may have hit a hopeful “turning point” in the struggle to tackle the climate crisis despite escalating greenhouse gas emissions and the recalcitrance of major emitters Brazil and the US, according to the United Nations secretary general.
On Sunday, ahead of a key UN climate summit in New York, the World Meteorological Organisation published new data showing 2014-19 to be the warmest five-year-period on record.
But UN secretary general António Guterres said recent action by some countries and businesses, as well as the stunning rise of the youth climate movement, gave him hope that international goals to avoid catastrophic global heating could be met.
“I see a new momentum,” Guterres said. “I believe in these last few months [there has been] a turning point. Six months ago, I must tell you, I was quite pessimistic about everything. I would see no movement, now I see a lot of movement and we need to boost that movement.”
Guterres said he expects “very meaningful” climate commitments to be made by countries during the summit on Monday, which was thrown open to world leaders who had new initiatives on cutting planet-warming gases to announce.
Representatives from around 60 countries will speak, including Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi and Boris Johnson, the British prime minister.
The summit is designed to sharply prod countries to do more to meet the commitments of the Paris climate accords, where governments agreed to limit the average global temperature rise to 2C above the pre-industrial era. The world has already warmed by around 1C since this time.
Progress has been limited. Global emissions hit a record high last year, Donald Trump has said the US, the world’s second-largest emitter, will quit the Paris deal and Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has opened the way to raze vast tracts of the Amazon rainforest.
Guterres said neither Brazil nor the US have “turned up” with any new commitments for the UN summit.
“Clearly, we are lagging behind and that there are many resistances in many areas,” he said. “I feel that we are still running late and we need to accelerate. The next few years are absolutely crucial to reverse the present trend, that is still a negative trend.
“Emissions are still growing and the situation is getting worse, clearly. I am deeply convinced that climate change is the defining issue of our time.”
The daunting task of staving off disastrous climate change has been laid bare in a new analysis released by the UN that shows global emissions are not estimated to peak by 2030, the year when scientists say emissions must be slashed by nearly half from now to avoid devastating heatwaves, flooding and loss of species.
This dire forecast, driven by the continued dominance of fossil fuels despite the growth of alternatives such as solar and wind power, means countries will need to at least triple their current emissions reduction commitments to meet the Paris target, the UN report states.
The G20, the world’s wealthiest countries, represent 80% of emissions but are according to the UN doing “nowhere near enough” to scale up their ambition, eclipsed by developing countries that in the case of low-lying countries in Asia and the Pacific are at most peril from rising seas and drought.
Guterres, who has called for net zero emissions by 2050 and the end of new coal projects from next year, said he expects countries will do more, although he admitted he was concerned by a spate of new coal mines backed by China.
On the Trump administration, the secretary general said: “Of course we understand that the policy that exists today is not in line with this concern [of climate change].”
The UN summit is set to provide a sobering counterpoint to Friday’s global climate strikes, where millions across 150 countries skipped work or school in order to protest inaction over the climate crisis.
Guterres said pressure from young people, galvanized by the Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg, will be “fundamental” in shaping the response from countries.
It appears however to have made little impression on Trump, who will pointedly be at the UN on Monday to attend a gathering on religious freedom rather than the climate summit.
“I don’t think other countries feel there’s much point putting pressure on President Trump because he hasn’t put off any signal in changing,” said Todd Stern, who was US special envoy for climate change during the Paris negotiations.
“In the absence of the US there is some lack of energy in the overall system so it’s good that the secretary general is convening people and pushing them hard.”
——Some major businesses have set out new goals, with a group of 87 companies – including Nestle, Nokia and L’Oreal – on Sunday committing to net zero emissions by 2050. But the abdication of the US looms large.
“The EU and China are the parties that can take this forward,” said Frank Rijsberman, director general of the Global Green Growth Institute. “It looks like we will have to wait until there’s another US president.”
The summit will be considered a success with a raft of new national commitments but it’s clear that even that may not be enough.
“I’m looking for something that will begin to bend that curve,” said Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights. “And until it begins to bend, we’re not there at all.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

“You are still not mature enough to tell it like it is,” Thunberg said, her voice shaking. “You are failing us, but the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you, and if you choose to fail us, I say, we will never forgive you.”
On Friday, millions of people around the world participated in the Global Climate Strike to protest governments failing to respond to climate change. Thunberg pioneered the school climate strike movement when she began protesting outside the Swedish parliament with a sign that read Skolstrejk för klimatet (school strike for the climate). Now, students around the world skip school on Fridays to protest climate change, driven by the belief that education will be meaningless in an uninhabitable world.
Last week, in lieu of testifying before Congress, Thunberg handed lawmakers a copy of the 2018 report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change about the effects of global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The World Meteorological Association reported Sunday that the five-year period from 2015 to 2019 was the warmest on record, averaging 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.
“We will not let you get away with this,” Thunberg said. “Right here, right now, is where we draw the line.”

“Approximately 80 percent of the world’s population live in countries where religious liberty is threatened, restricted, or even banned,” Trump said at the event, citing a statistic from a Pew Research Center report that also attributed anti-Muslim sentiment, in part, to him. “When I heard that number, I said, ‘Please go back and check it because it can’t possibly be correct.’ And, sadly, it was. Eighty percent.” (It’s actually 83 percent.)
Trump and his advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, love this statistic. They’ve invoked it several times during the administration’s months-long push to make religious freedom a central plank of American foreign policy, which has included two State Department summits and Trump’s Oval Office meeting in July with victims of religious persecution.
And while they’re quick to highlight American adversaries like Nicaragua and Venezuela, as Trump did in his Monday speech, they often fail to mention an ally which Pew rates as one of the worst suppressors of religious freedom: Saudi Arabia.
Under the growing influence of Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, who Trump praised in June for sparking a “revolution in a very positive way,” Saudi Arabia has already executed 134 people this year, on pace for an increase over last year’s total of 149 prisoners killed, according to a report submitted to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva last week. Six were children at the time of their alleged crimes. Among the slain were 37 men, mostly from the country’s Shia Muslim minority, who were killed en masse in April. Saudi authorities accused them of links to terrorist organizations, but those arrested “didn’t appear to be connected to Islamic State or another extremist group,” the Wall Street Journal reported.
Saudi Arabia performs most executions by beheading and, in many cases, the country “failed or refused to release the bodies of victims of executions to their families,” the report stated. Charges “appear to broadly relate to political dissidence and participation in protests,” and are often extracted by forced confessions. One detainee awaiting execution by crucifixion, which means his body will be displayed after the beheading, was 15 at the time of his arrest and confessed to a range of nonviolent offenses, such as “chanting slogans,” after what the report describes as “beatings with iron rods.”
The report, compiled by British human rights lawyer Helena Kennedy, brought more international condemnation on Saudi Arabia and the crown prince, whose early reputation as a moderate reformer has fallen apart amid his costly intervention in Yemen’s civil war and crackdown on dissent among Saudi elites, which culminated in the murder last year of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist writing for the Washington Post. The CIA determined in November that the Saudi crown prince ordered the killing.
Even the State Department has acknowledged the kingdom’s sordid history of persecuting religious minorities. “Freedom of religion is not provided under the law,” a department report on religious freedom flatly stated earlier this year. “The government does not allow the public practice of any non-Muslim religion.” The US Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan advisory body, drew attention to the State Department’s uneven response to Saudi Arabia in a blistering statement after the kingdom’s mass executions of mostly Shia men in April. “The State Department must stop giving a free pass to the Saudi government, which, for many years, has punished numerous Saudi citizens and expatriate workers for exercising their fundamental right to freedom of religion or belief,” commission chair Tenzin Dorjee said, noting that the US has repeatedly identified Saudi Arabia as a “country of particular concern” for its religious persecution, but has held off on issuing any punitive action for more than a decade.
Far from scolding Saudi Arabia, Trump has praised its crown prince for doing “a really spectacular job” fighting terrorists and granting women the right to drive. (Left unsaid was Saudi Arabia’s year-long imprisonment of the same activists who pushed for that modernizing change.)
Trump himself is no “tireless champion of the freedom of religion,” as Pence claimed in his introductory remarks at the UN. In addition to promoting a Muslim ban, which his administration softened into a travel ban affecting several majority-Muslim countries, Trump has frequently trafficked in anti-Semitic tropes and once said there was “a Muslim problem in the world.” His religious freedom push writ large has often received criticism for seeming to be geared more toward Christians at the expense of other minority groups.
Saudi Arabia has been an American ally for decades, but Trump has taken a relationship with its roots in the oil and arms trade and foregrounded the unsavory quid pro quo inherent to a partnership between an authoritarian theocracy and Western democracy. “After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States,” Trump noted in a 638-word statement defending the Saudis in November, as pressure tightened on the White House to hold the kingdom accountable for Khashoggi’s murder. “This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States.”
The high regard with which Trump holds the Saudis was most apparent on Friday, when he approved the deployment of US troops to the Middle East in response to an apparent Iranian attack on two Saudi oil facilities. (No evidence has emerged to definitively link Iran to the attack, and the Islamic republic has denied responsibility, but Trump administration officials like Pompeo have blamed them for it.) Trump, who has otherwise criticized American allies for expecting the US to foot the bill for their defense, tweeted in support of the Saudis in a way that suggested he was relying on their direction before responding.

“Too often, people in positions of power preach diversity while silencing, shunning, or censoring the faithful,” Trump said during his UN speech. “True tolerance means respecting the right of all people to express their deeply held religious beliefs.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The two men have also made clear that the end goal is to paint the Biden family as corrupt. “What Biden did was a disgrace,” Trump said at the UN on Monday. “What Biden’s son did was a disgrace.” Trump’s apparent effort to coerce a foreign power into meddling in the next presidential election has fueled condemnation from across the political spectrum.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Adam Schiff: We “May Have Crossed the Rubicon” on Impeachment,Edwin Rios,MotherJones,Politics,"Rep. Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, warned on Sunday that President Donald Trump is “pushing us down this road” toward impeachment amid allegations that the president pressed Ukraine’s president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden’s son.
The calls for impeachment have grown louder after reports earlier this week that an intelligence community whistleblower warned that Trump made an unspecified commitment to a foreign leader. Trump reportedly pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden’s son’s business dealings when Biden was vice president.
On Sunday, Trump admitted to reporters that he had discussed Biden with the Ukrainian president but insisted there was no “quid pro quo” between the two leaders. “I’m not looking to hurt Biden or even hold him to it,” Trump said. Trump has called the allegations a “witch hunt” and accused Biden, as vice president, of calling for the removal of Ukraine’s top prosecutor who had been investigating corruption by an oligarch connected to Biden’s son. On the campaign trail, Biden has called for a House investigation into whether Trump sought foreign assistance for his re-election bid.
During an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union”, Schiff told James Tapper that the reported allegations from the whistleblower complaint may finally force House Democrats to go down the road of impeachment.
“Why doesn’t the President just say, ‘Release the whistleblower complaint.’ Clearly he’s afraid for the public to see,” Schiff said. “This would be the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office, certainly during this presidency, which says a lot, but perhaps during any presidency. There is no privilege that covers corruption. There is no privilege to engage in underhanded discussions.”
“We may have crossed the rubicon here,” he added. “I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment…but…that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.”

A day earlier, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called for impeachment proceedings, tweeting that “the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior-it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it.” And just this week, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the first 2020 candidates to call for impeachment, argued on Twitter that Congress was “complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in U.S. elections.” Ocasio-Cortez turned the gaze toward Democrats.

Trump has refused to release the whistleblower complaint or the transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, ignoring demands from Democratic House and Senate leadership. Pelosi first urged the administration to release the complaint on Friday and followed up with a pointed letter to her Republican colleagues on Sunday.

Pelosi, who has not called for Trump’s impeachment, warned that preventing the whistleblower complaint’s disclosure would amount to a violation of federal statute. “The Administration is endangering our national security and having a chilling effect on any future whistleblower who sees wrongdoing,” she noted.
“If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,” Pelosi concluded.
On Sunday, Trump admitted to reporters that he had discussed former vice president Joe Biden with Ukraine’s president but insisted there was no “quid pro quo” between the two leaders.
Meanwhile, consensus is growing that Trump’s request of the Ukrainian president constitutes an impeachable offense. Schiff told CNN’s Jake Tapper that if Trump withheld foreign aid to Ukraine hoping for an inquiry into a political opponent, then impeachment proceedings “may be the only remedy.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

Trump Is Partly to Blame.,Edwin Rios,MotherJones,Politics,"Since Donald Trump took office in January 2017, Republican lawmakers have left the House of Representatives in droves. A Washington Post analysis found that 40 percent of the 241 Republicans who have been in office since January 2017 have departed or retired.
Forty-one have announced they wouldn’t seek reelection or left national politics altogether since Trump took office, more than the two dozen Democrats who left during Obama’s first term in office. But why? “The vast turnover is a reminder of just how much Trump has remade the GOP—and of the purge of those who dare to oppose him,” the Post reported.
Though many have publicly cited family as the reason, the Post reported that privately, there’s some frustration about the party’s future direction under Trump. “I think a lot of members are pretty nervous that Trump doesn’t win reelection. And then we’re in the minority and we have a Democrat in the White House,” a Republican leadership aide told the Post. “We’re in the wilderness right now, but if you lose the White House, then that is the extreme wilderness.”
Republican Rep. Paul Mitchell, who announced his retirement in July following Trump’s tweets telling Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, put it this way:
“Did any member of this conference expect that their job would start out every morning trying to go through the list of what’s happening in tweets of the day? We’re not moving forward right now. We are simply thrashing around.”

I had an, um, spirited discussion about political matters with a friend this morning, and among other things he disagreed with my considered assessment that Ukrainegate, if true, represented “Nixonian levels of corruption.” In fact, he saw nothing wrong with it at all. It was just ordinary politics and he figured that presidents ask foreign leaders for favors like this all the time. Oh, and why did Joe Biden want to get rid of that prosecutor, anyway?
What’s more, he said, this wasn’t nearly as bad as all the stuff Hillary did. Nor was it as bad as Obama promising “more flexibility” to the Russians on a hot mic. It was just more Democratic witch huntery, like Mueller all over again, who proved that Trump was innocent of obstruction of justice because you can only obstruct criminal investigations, not counterintelligence inquiries.
I wasn’t even really mad about all this. Just depressed. This is what a big chunk of ordinary conservativedom thinks, and nothing is going to change it.
It’s pretty clear at this point that Trump realizes the truth of what happened is likely to come out. So he’s doing what he usually does: preemptively declaring that there’s nothing wrong with it and getting the entire conservative machine to publicly agree with him. I don’t know if it will work, but if Trump did what we all think he did, then he has to be impeached. It doesn’t matter if it’s politically helpful or not. It doesn’t matter if the Senate is likely to convict. It has to be done, and Republicans have to be put on the record as either approving or disapproving of his conduct.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The Global Climate Strike, a youth-led movement that has partnered with environmental organizations around the world, scheduled the strike to take place three days before the United Nations 2019 Climate Action Summit. The protests began in Australia, where an estimated 100,000 people marched in Melbourne, with 80,000 more marching in Sydney and 30,000 in Brisbane, CNN reports. As Friday dawned in time zones across the world, cities from Mumbai to Nairobi to Berlin joined in what is expected to be the largest day of climate demonstrations in history.
Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who first inspired students to skip school to protest climate change in August 2018, will join protestors in New York City, whose public school students were excused from class Friday and encouraged to join in the march.

In March, Mother Jones environmental reporter Rebecca Leber wrote about what is driving young people like Thunberg to take climate action:
Friday’s Global Climate Strike, an extension of students’ Fridays for Future strikes around the world, is one result of the “future victims” finding their voice.

Slim pine trunks stacked in a mound loomed over my head, curving around me in a partial circle like a dam built by Brontosaurus-sized beavers. I’d followed a long unmarked dirt road earlier this year to see it: One of 48 wood piles in a 12 square-mile section of the Tahoe National Forest outside the town of Truckee in northern California. You can find similar scenes across the western United States, anywhere work crews are clearing brush and small trees from forests.
They’re monuments to a widespread effort to cull tinder for future wildfires. Drought, disease, and insects have left 100 million dead trees browning across California, and in some places, 90 percent of the trees have died. All this dry wood can stoke small blazes into uncontrollable infernos that ravage towns and choke the region with smoke. Last year was California’s worst fire season yet, with blazes blackening an area the size of Delaware and killing 104 people. Forests are so unhealthy they are now emitting more carbon than they produce, according to recent studies.
At the same time, California is counting on its forests sucking up lots of carbon from cars, factories, and power plants to meet its goals to slash carbon emissions. “If forests are greenhouse-gas emitters rather than sinks, it puts a massive hole in those plans,” said Patrick Gonzalez, a forest ecologist at the University of California at Berkeley who led one of those studies.
Those giant piles of wood were just a tiny part of a massive outlay of money and sweat to restore forests in California and across the West. The state has removed 1.5 million dead trees in the last three years, said Nic Enstice, a scientist at the Sierra Nevada Conservancy, a California state agency. “But we’re not keeping pace,” he said. “There are way more dead trees out there than we will ever get to.”
When settlers took control of what would become the western United States in the 1800s, they started putting out the fires, reversing the Native American practice of setting fires to manage forests. After nearly two centuries of fire suppression, the forests have changed. Shade-tolerant species like incense cedar and white fir have crowded under the pines, Enstice said. Once spacious groves are now choked with small trees and brush. And when drought hits California, exacerbated by ever-hotter summers, these trees have to compete for scarce water. As they dry up, the pines are unable to produce the sap needed to fend off bark beetles, which girdle one tree after another, turning big patches of forest canopy from green to a sickly reddish-brown.

The 15-foot towers of kindling that I saw aren’t even the largest, said Steve Frisch, president of the Sierra Business Council, a nonprofit that works to improve the region surrounding the Sierra Nevada mountains. “I’ve seen these piles when I’m out mountain biking,” he said. “I come around a corner and all of a sudden there’s this freaking massive mound of wood the size of a four-story apartment building.”
It’s so difficult and expensive to haul these mounds out of the forests that workers often end up dousing them with lighter fluid and setting them ablaze. Better to release the heat and pollution during the winter, they figure, rather than in the summer as part of a wildfire. But either way, the result is more carbon emissions.
The situation has led some environmentalists to a counterintuitive idea: turning that wood into energy. When wood burns in power plants, the smoke passes through a series of filters so that the plume that drifts up from the smokestack has almost none of the harmful particulates that would be released if it burned in a wildfire or bonfire. It’s a way to reduce pollution and generate energy at the same time. Advocates imagine small wood-burning plants scattered throughout the West, providing power to mountain towns and providing an economic incentive to keep clearing excess wood, shrink forest fires, and allow the remaining trees to grow stronger and healthier.
These wood-fired plants produce what’s known as biomass energy. Biomass is just the general term for grass, dung, corn, or anything else containing energy (soaked up from sunlight) stored in chains of carbon (soaked up from the air). By burning biomass, you release the sun’s energy in the form of heat and light. But you also release its carbon back into the atmosphere.
That’s one of the reasons it’s controversial as hell. Environmentalists have long fought to block biomass power plants. Turning trees into electricity seems to violate the basic tenets of tree hugging. There’s a thorny debate over whether biomass energy can really be considered clean or renewable. But there’s no doubt that biomass plants can be environmental disasters when run improperly. After all, producing electricity by burning wood produces more carbon and pollution per kilowatt than burning coal, the Sierra Club points out. The group’s California branch recently plastered billboards with the anti-biomass message, “A tree is a great life source, not an energy source.” Which makes the fact that some deep-green activists are campaigning to build wood-burning power plants in their own backyards all the more surprising.
Barbara and Don Rivenes fell in love with the West Coast’s wilderness after moving to California in 1967 with their young family. “I just couldn’t get over the landscape,” Barbara said. “California knocked my socks off.”
They became avid environmentalists, volunteering and attending countless meetings. Barbara was the sole employee for the Golden Gate Audubon Society and Don served on the state board—”and every other damn thing,” Barbara said. In 1997, the Rivenes moved to Nevada City, a town enveloped by a green mantle of ponderosa pines in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas between Sacramento and Lake Tahoe. They dove into the work of protecting the forest. Barbara got involved with the local Sierra Club chapter, and Don became executive director of the Forest Issues Group—a watchdog organization that tries to stop companies from logging and destroying habitat.
When government officials and fire experts formed a group to figure out what to do with all the wood stacking up in the surrounding forests—a biomass task force—Barbara and Don seemed like perfect candidates to represent the environmentalist’s perspective.
In 2010, they attended their first of many task-force meetings in a packed government building. Bureaucrats, politicians, and fire experts from universities floated proposals for taking care of the wood. The timber was too small to turn into traditional lumber, but it could serve as dandy fence posts or maybe woodchips for a playground. None of the suggestions would’ve put a dent in the massive supply. More promising was the idea of using wood for the construction of tall buildings instead of concrete and steel, which together produce about 10 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. That would sequester the carbon small trees had absorbed during their lives. But current building codes make it hard to build very tall wood structures. In the meantime, the experts concluded, the cost of trucking the wood out of the forest would exceed the amount anyone would pay. So the stacks stayed put.
As the meetings piled up, Don and Barbara gradually became convinced that biomass energy plants could help the Western United States manage its forests. Though they still opposed cutting down trees just to burn them, they reasoned that it would be better to burn trees in biomass plants than to burn those house-sized mounds where they stood. Burning wood efficiently in biomass furnaces and running the smoke through filters would eliminate most of the particulate pollution, including 98 percent of the soot—sometimes called the second most important heat-trapping pollutant after carbon dioxide.
The Nevada County task force—Barbara and Don included—launched a study that foundthat the ongoing work of thinning dense trees from the surrounding forests would generate nearly five times as much wood as a 3-megawatt plant (providing enough energy to power 3,000 homes) could use every year. That relieved the Rivenes’ concern that a biomass plant could lead to deforestation. “It seemed like there are good possibilities for this, if you are careful,” Barbara said.
The notion of peppering California’s rural mountain towns with small wood-burning power plants might have sounded improbable when this local group started meeting. But then California’s legislature passed a law to subsidize small biomass plants in 2012. The idea behind the legislation was that plants would spring up to provide power to small towns, providing an economic incentive to clear fuels out of the path of future wildfires. A private company expressed interest in building a plant in Grass Valley, next door to Nevada City, if it could work out a deal to sell the power it generated to California’s primary utility company, Pacific Gas & Electric.
Locals seemed to like the idea, which sounds incredible to anyone familiar with area. In the 1960s, the region became a popular refuge for hippies and artists from the Bay Area—folks who usually embrace nature and fight to shut down logging operations. “In Nevada City, if there was someone standing on the corner handing out $100 bills, there would be people protesting,” said Steve Eubanks, the former supervisor of the Tahoe National Forest and a member of that biomass task force. “But there hasn’t been serious opposition to this.”
The plant might already be under construction were it not for a twist of fate. The company behind the proposed Grass Valley biomass plant couldn’t negotiate a deal to sell power to PG&E because the utility declared bankruptcy in January. The main reason it filed for Chapter 11 protection: massive liability claims from wildfires. In an irony that crops up routinely in our warming world, efforts to adapt to a rapidly changing environment were thwarted by a rapidly changing environment.
Traditionally, environmentalists have fought to stop chainsaws and bulldozers, so it’s no surprise that most oppose logging for biomass energy. Outfits like the Natural Resource Defense Council, for instance, have been campaigning against the practice of clearcutting forests in Southeastern states to make wood pellets for export to biomass plants in Europe. Although small, California-style biomass plants have drawn support from some major environmental groups, others, like the Center for Biological Diversity and the John Muir Project, remain adamantly opposed. Part of the reason is that the opposition to burning anything for energy that releases carbon into the air runs deep.
“Treating the trees in our forests like they are sticks of coal is one of the biggest threats to climate change mitigation that’s out there right now,” said Chad Hanson, a lawyer and forest ecologist who directs the John Muir Project.
In the Western states, the fight over biomass isn’t just about the best ways to create energy; it’s also a dispute over how to manage forests. Some groups argue for prescribed burns and selective cutting to restore forests to something closer to how they were before settlers started clearcutting and suppressing fire.
But according to Hanson, the conventional wisdom that California’s forests are unhealthily dense with wildfire fuel and need to be cleaned up is just wrong. He rejects the idea that thinning forests—and creating the fuel for biomass plants along the way—makes wildfires any less destructive.
Instead of a build-up of needles and branches, Hanson sees a build-up of carbon. It seems crazy, from his perspective, to burn this wood before a wildfire gets to it and release all that carbon into the air. Better to spend money on fireproofing houses and let the forests burn and recover as they may, Hanson said. “That’s one of the key aspects of the dominant narrative: You’ve got to go thin the forest—no, no, you don’t,” he said. “Biomass logging does not prevent fires. The more you do it, the more likely the fires are going to burn hotter, and faster, and more intensely.”
In a review of scientific studies on forest carbon management, two professors at Oregon State University, Beverly Law and Mark Harmon, made the case that cutting small trees to reduce carbon emissions from wildfires simply doesn’t work because you end up having to remove more wood than those fires would burn—leaving fewer trees to store carbon.
Even if you embrace Hanson’s position that a hands-off approach is best, utilities and municipal workers in California continue cutting down trees to protect themselves from fire. Homeowners are supposed to clear a “defensible space” 100 feet from their houses. All that work is generating tons of woody biomass. I asked Kathryn Phillips, who leads the lobbying efforts for Sierra Club California, if she thought it made sense to burn that wood to generate energy.
Though Phillips’ organization is officially neutral on the point, her response was that people shouldn’t be burning wood at all. The best option is to leave the wood in the forest. The rest might be chipped up or used for furniture and building materials. If people need to clear fuels off their land, “they need to figure out options to do something with that wood,” she said. “And if those options don’t exist they need to complain to the state. Burning it in a biomass plant isn’t the answer.”
Almost all of the researchers I talked to thought that forest would be healthier with some thinning and burning to repair the legacy of clearcutting and fire suppression. Researchers were split, however, on the question of whether managing forests, or leaving them to the whims of nature, would allow them to soak up more carbon from the atmosphere. I began to notice a pattern: Scientists based in Oregon and Washington would tell me that simply leaving forests be was the best way to catch carbon, while researchers in Arizona and California would stress the importance of cutting some trees and performing prescribed burns. It makes sense: Forests get a lot more flammable as you move south. In the more arid parts of the West, they’re adapted to fires passing through as often as every five years, but a century of fire suppression has left them starved for burns.
The differing views even show up in the models researchers build to forecast how forests will respond to management. If you assume forests will rarely burn, as they did in the era of fire suppression, your models will show that it’s better to let nature take its course, said Dick Cameron, director of terrestrial science for The Nature Conservancy. In short, whether thinning and controlled burns can help trees suck up more carbon likely depends on the changing climate, Cameron said.
The Nature Conservancy recently reviewed the science on California’s forests and determined that thinning trees and setting prescribed burns—”active management”—would release more carbon in the beginning but pay off in the long run with big, carbon-gulping trees that can survive forest fires.
That jibes with what the many scientists I talked to told me. Trees in dense thickets compete for water, said Matthew Hurteau, a scientist at the University of New Mexico who studies the way forests adapt to climate change. When researchers remove small trees, he said, the remaining larger trees grew rapidly, sucking up more carbon and storing it in thicker rings of wood than previous years
For the Nature Conservancy, it isn’t just a question of carbon. The organization is also interested in improving wildlife habitat, safeguarding clean water supplies, and protecting people from the harmful effects of wildfire smoke. “There are a lot of reasons we really see a need to actively manage these forests,” Cameron said. Actively managing even a small percentage of California’s forest land would generate many more giant piles of wood that might go to biomass plants.
Although Nevada City wasn’t able to work out a deal with PG&E, other biomass projects are getting underway in mountain towns across northern California as residents come to the same realization as Rivenes’ task force. The town of Quincy built a biomass furnacelast year to supply heat and power to government buildings. In the foothills east of Fresno, the town of North Fork is building another small plant. Both have the support of local environmental nonprofits. In Calaveras County, southeast of Sacramento, one organic farmer has been rallying support to build a biomass generator. In Mariposa County, which includes part of Yosemite National Park, a group of renewable power enthusiasts embraced biomass after they realized that the county couldn’t get off fossil fuels by just relying on solar, wind, and batteries (nobody has figured out how to do that yet without occasionally leaving the town in the dark). The forests in that part of the state are so unhealthy that even the most chainsaw-averse tree hugger might have second thoughts.
“We have people drive up here and say, ‘Why are all your trees dead?’ There are areas that look like they’ve been hit by a bomb,” said Steve Smallcombe, one of the volunteers working to get a small biomass plant in Mariposa. “I think environmentalists see that the way our forests have become isn’t good for anyone.”
Several environmental activists told me that as forests have deteriorated, they’ve seen a shift in the way environmental groups approached biomass plants. They’ve moved from outright opposition to silence, and sometimes have even campaigned on behalf of small plants. The nonprofit Sierra Institute for Community and the Environment, for instance, championed Quincy’s biomass plant.
“It’s always anxiety-producing to support something related to cutting down trees,” said Sue Britting, executive director of the environmental group Sierra Forest Legacy. “But we have certainly been neutral on some biomass plants—and sometimes support them outright.”
This change in environmental attitudes might signal the start of a new stage in the relationship between humans and forests in the West. In the first stage, Native Americans used forests sustainably, frequently setting them on fire to clear out underbrush and improve habitat for game, according to Jonathan Kusel, the Sierra Institute for Community and the Environment’s executive director. In the second stage, starting in the Gold Rush and continuing into the 1950s, when logging peaked in California, Americans levelled forests. “The history of the timber industry is one of cutting across the country, leaving the land bare and moving on,” Kusel said.
In the third stage, environmentalists fought the timber industry and, by the 1990s, they’d effectively won, putting an end to most logging in the state. This victory, Kusel said, went too far, thwarting good forest management and leaving people in many small towns without much work. “Twenty years ago, environmentalists and industry were both saying, ‘We’re fighting on the side of rural communities,'” Kusel said. “They were both lying.” The timber industry just wanted to extract profits and move on, he said—and once environmental groups won in court, they moved on, too.
The fourth stage of this relationship between humans and trees, then, could be a return to sustainable use—in which forests provide wood for people to build houses and maybe some renewable energy.
Those giant piles of wood I saw this spring have been sitting in the forest for years now. Jim Turner, who runs a biomass plant a half hour away in the town of Loyalton, wanted to get his hands on them.
Turner’s plant was once home to a sawmill, and its generator burned scrap wood. Its General Electric steam turbine was manufactured in the 1950s, but mechanics rebuilt it entirely in 2010. Now the machine hums along—producing enough electricity to power 20,000 houses—possessing the weathered beauty of a well-made old tool.
When the mill closed in 2001, Turner convinced the timber company, Sierra Pacific Industries, to keep the biomass plant going. “It wasn’t some magnanimous thing,” he said. “It just had to be done. I wanted to live here.”
Today, the plant has 21 full time employees from Loyalton’s population of around 700. It’s easy to see why Turner wanted to stay. The plant sits on a beautiful spot, surrounded by a handful of houses clustered in a mountain meadow ringed by wooded peaks. Turner never locks his doors, and he likes that his neighbor feels comfortable enough to borrow his truck sometimes without bothering to ask.
Some environmentalists worry that more small biomass plants like Turner’s would drive deforestation. It’s an objection that’s lost on Turner. He can only afford to pay $30 or $40 for a ton of wood. If someone was going to cut down big trees, they’d sell them to a lumber mill for $200 a ton, maybe more. Data obtained from the Forest Service shows that it would take Turner more than 20 years to use up woodpiles from land within 70 miles of the Loyalton plant where the Forest Service could thin out small trees. After 20 years, those original acres would be due for a second thinning.
These days, fewer environmentalists are claiming that Turner wants to clear cut forests, and more are asking him for help.
“In the 2000s, we were demonized,” Turner said. “Biomass! It’s dirty power. But in 2009 I started to see a huge shift with these catastrophic wildfires.”
Backpackers and mountain bikers in the Western US can no longer mistake their forests for a perfectly balanced garden of Eden. Neither can city dwellers: This summer was the first since 2015 that people weren’t choking on wildfire smoke up and down the West Coast.
For the first time in this Californian’s memory, lots of people are thinking about leaving the state because of the poor air quality. And it’s likely to get worse before it gets better. Estimates suggest that twice as much forest burned in an average year before European settlement as burned in 2018, when more of California burned than any year since 1800. The Western United States is probably going to be a much smokier place as fires consume a century of backlogged fuel—unless forest managers can space out those burns and trap some of the smoke in filters.
Even if biomass power gathers more public support, Turner is skeptical that small plants like the one planned for Nevada City can survive. Without more government help, it would be hard for plants like his to turn a profit. Turner has other troubles: The company American Renewable Power bought his plant in 2017, and since then it has lost money. “I’m just going to lay it out there,” he said. “I’m impressed that the investors have hung on.”
Instead of supporting biomass by forcing utilities to pay extra for the electricity, Turner said it might make more sense for the state to pay directly for the things its citizens want: forest health, smoke reduction, and carbon sequestration. If biomass plants can provide those services, “that’s great” he said. “And if not, if something else is cheaper, fair enough. Let’s not waste taxpayer money.”
Earlier this month, the Forest Service and Turner finally agreed on a price after months of negotiations, and workers began moving that brushy edifice of wood from outside Truckee to the Loyalton plant. Scores of wood piles remain scattered throughout California and the rest of the Western states. Steve Eubanks, who spent 40 years in the Forest Service, said there’s no question about what will happen if the service’s land managers can’t sell that wood: They will simply burn it in place.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

In New York, as in countless places around the world, people ditched school and work to take part in the Global Climate Strike to push for meaningful governmental action against climate change.
New York’s public school students were excused from classes Friday to join the march from Foley Square to Battery Park. Students of all ages chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, climate change has got to go,” and, “Fossil fuel or fossil-free, what will be our legacy?”
Some carried humorous signs, like one that nodded to Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts,” in which an illustration of Earth floats beside bold text that says, “I just took a CO2 test, turns out I’m 100% dying.” Others were punchier: “Planet Before Profit” and “Corporate Greed is Killing the Planet.”
The students we spoke to were passionate, thoughtful, and well-informed about the major contributors to climate change. Samantha Nowak, an 18-year-old student at Manhattan Marymount College, said that she uses reusable shopping bags and eats less meat because of climate change. “You can’t ignore something like this,” she said, referring to the size of the protest. “Hopefully it’ll get people active, calling their representatives and making more changes in their personal lifestyle.”
“Hopefully we can spark a larger change on a higher, government level,” her roommate Kandace Campbell, 17, said. “But also, it’s like, where is the hope for that, because how much do they care?”
Jake Eraca, a 17-year-old high school senior from New York’s Dutchess County, said he realized the severity of the climate crisis when Iceland commemorated the loss of its Okjokull glacier with a plaque warning that the country would lose all its glaciers in the next 200 years. “This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done,” the plaque reads. “Only you know if we did it.”
“I sat in my bed and was on the brink of tears because I was like, ‘I’m not going to live past 50,'” Eraca said over the roar of passing strikers beating on drums. “I’m not going to have the life my parents had. Why am I worrying about college, why am I worrying about my grades? Why am I even trying if there’s no future for me to have?”
Eraca’s younger sister, Jillian, 16, had similar fears.”I don’t know if I will have a future,” she said. “I think about if I’m gonna have kids, what their life would be like.” Phoebe Anderson, 17,  agreed. “I’ve always wanted kids, but now I’m just like, why think about it?”
Eraca said that the protests gave him hope, but that ultimately there’s more work to be done at the congressional level. “This is a good first step,” he said, “but if we don’t get recognition, we’re not gonna go anywhere.”

Two 20-year-old students at the Fashion Institute of Technology, Isabella Mayes and Chloe Dechambeau, wanted to call attention to the pollution in the fashion industry. Both students are minoring in ethics and sustainability, and they were critical of fast fashion like Zara and Forever 21.
Despite the bleak environmental outlook, Dechambeau and Mayes were heartened by the children who came to protest.”I’m overwhelmed right now by how many young people there are,” Mayes said. “I was almost brought to tears.”
One group of students said that corporate greed was at the heart of the climate change problem.”I think we need generally much more tight regulations on large corporations that are the biggest polluters, much more accountability,” said Uma Channer, a 19-year-old sophomore at Sarah Lawrence College.
Her friend Tara Blossom added that she supports Bernie Sanders’ promise to move away from fossil fuels and his emphasis on using renewable energy instead.
Sumayya Bisseret Martinez, a 19-year-old New York University sophomore, wanted to draw attention to racial exclusivity and classism in the environmental movement. “Let’s be honest,” she said. “Climate change most impacts…black and brown communities and people who have lower incomes.”
Among the younger protestors were three best friends in the eighth grade who sported clever signs bearing slogans they found online. Mary Rousakis, 12, said that she has become conscious of how her actions, like using plastic or eating meat, are affecting the environment. “I personally really want a good future ahead of me where we don’t have so many endangered species and extinction of species,” she said. “It kind of just puts a dimmer on my dreams and hopes for the future.”
“The government needs to focus more on our earth and how to clean it and help the environment instead of just focusing on profit,” her friend Grace Chen, 13, said. “It’s important for young people like us to talk about this because we are the future voters.”
“I think it is so great to see a big turnout to see how many people are supporting it,” said 13-year-old Nona Stislow. “It seems like there’s more hope for the earth, and I really hope it does make a difference.”

“This is impeachable now,” congressional expert and historian Norm Ornstein tweeted Friday evening. “Right now.”
According to multiple news reports, President Trump has attempted to coerce the president of Ukraine into working with his personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, to investigate a political opponent, Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden. To pressure the Ukrainian president, Trump withheld hundreds of millions in military aid until earlier this month. In one phone call in July, Trump reportedly pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden’s son about eight times. The full details of the allegations, outlined in a whistleblower complaint that the Trump administration is currently withholding from Congress, are still unclear, but the emerging consensus is that, if true, the reported abuses surpass even those outlined in the Mueller Report on Russian interference in 2016.
“The current whistleblowing allegations, however, are even worse” than the conduct detailed in the Mueller report, Republican lawyer and Trump critic George Conway wrote in a Friday evening Washington Post op-ed co-written with Neal Katyal, former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration. “Unlike the allegations of conspiracy with Russia before the 2016 election, these concern Trump’s actions as president, not as a private citizen, and his exercise of presidential powers over foreign policy with Ukraine.” Further, they noted, “the White House is trying to shut down the entire inquiry from the start — depriving not just the American people, but even congressional intelligence committees, of necessary information.”
On Twitter, former officials and legal experts argued this scandal cannot become just another Trump news cycle.


The allegation Trump and Giuliani are pushing against Biden—that his anti-corruption work as vice president, which included urging the firing of a former prosecutor general who had investigated a Ukrainian gas company that his son Hunter was on the board of—have been debunked. Daria Kaleniuk, an American-educated lawyer who founded Ukraine’s Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the Intercept that the former prosecutor was fired at Biden’s urging because he failed to investigate corruption thoroughly and in fact stifled investigations.
Biden fired back at Trump on Friday night. “If these reports are true,” he said in a statement, “then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.”

On Saturday morning, Trump sent off a string of tweets claiming, in language that sounds a lot like his tweets against the Mueller investigation did, that the real scandal is Biden, the “Fake News Media,” and the Democrats. He characterized his own conversations with Ukraine’s president as “perfectly fine and routine.” This scandal, he says, is also a witch hunt.



Trump may convince his fans. But in Ukraine, his efforts are transparent. “Trump is now looking for kompromat to discredit his opponent Biden, to take revenge for his friend Paul Manafort, who is serving seven years in prison,” a Ukrainian official, Anton Geraschenko, a senior adviser to the country’s interior minister, told the Daily Beast.

In Los Angeles it’s an endless battle, with activists fighting to keep everything from skid row to historically black neighborhoods out of the hands of the rich. One councilmember not only wants to reject a housing proposal proposed for an empty lot in his district, he wants to establish “anti-displacement zones”—which probably means rent control—around all upscale housing developments.
It’s a difficult issue because it’s so easy to see both sides. On the one hand, longtime residents really do get pushed out as rents go up and affluent white folks move in. It seems obviously unfair to toss that onto the bonfire of all the other abuses and inequities that blacks and Hispanics already suffer. On the other hand, can we really say that low-income areas should stay low-income areas forever and never be improved? That hardly seems like a great answer either.
I don’t have anything new to offer on this front except to recommend this story from the Washington Post. It focuses on one particular area of grievance, but it does a good job of laying it out from multiple points of view and without trying to put all the blame on one side or one thing.

On Saturday, the Democratic candidate announced an ambitious plan to eliminate $81 billion medical debt for Americans, reform bankruptcy laws, and even put an end to credit score agencies.
“The very concept of medical debt should not exist,” Sanders said in a statement. “In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, one illness or disease should not ruin a family’s financial life and future.”
Medical debt is a significant economic burden on millions of Americans —and though there is an academic debate over exactly how many bankruptcies are directly attributable to it, health care expenses are the largest single causes of bankruptcies nationwide. According to a 2014 report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, half of all debt reported to credit agencies is medical debt, and one out of every five credit reports contains unpaid medical debt. It’s also a serious—though hard to measure—hazard to people’s health. A 2018 study from West Health and Gallup found that a quarter of all Americans had skipped a medical treatment due to cost.
Under Sanders’ plan, the government would negotiate and pay off $81 billion in unpaid medical bills that have been sold to collection agencies and are currently harming people’s credit reports. His plan would also limit the notorious tactics debt collectors engage in when they track people down and hound them to collect on the debts they have purchased. If implemented, the plan might also come well under its $81 billion price tag as debt sold to debt collectors is worth only a fraction of the original bill.
In addition, Sanders’ plan would reform the 2005 bankruptcy law (the one Elizabeth Warren vigorously opposed and Joe Biden supported) so that it will be easier to forgive medical debt.
Finally, the proposal would stop medical debt from impacting people’s credit scores. Sanders would create a federal credit registry to rival and ultimately replace credit agencies like Equifax, and medical debt would not be factored into anyone’s score. “Credit scores also systematically perpetuate gaps in wealth and inequality between white and minority consumers,” the plan states. “We will establish a public registry that will end racial biases in credit scores and ensure those with medical debt are not penalized for the ‘crime’ of getting sick.”
On Twitter Saturday, Sanders’ campaign shared the experiences of some Americans weighed down by medical bills.

“You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader?” Biden told reporters in Iowa. “This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power. To get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things … this is outrageous. You have never seen anything like this from any president.”
Biden’s comments came after Fox News reporter Peter Doocy asked the former vice president how many times he had spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. Biden responded that he never had. Doocy’s question is about the faux-scandal that President Donald Trump is trying to drum up and is reportedly part of a whistleblower complaint in the Intelligence Community. According to news accounts, Trump has been pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter.
“You should be looking at Trump,” Biden continued. “Everybody looked at this and everybody who’s looked at it said there’s nothing there. Ask the right question.”

Biden said he would wait for the House’s investigation to make a judgement on whether Trump should be impeached. But other candidates have gone further, renewing calls for impeachment in light of his apparent abuse of power to go after Biden.


“I know what I’m up against,” Biden told reporters. “A serial abuser. That’s what this guy is. He abuses power any way he can. This crosses the line.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","The Environmental Protection Agency announced on Thursday that it will revoke California’s waiver that allowed the state to enforce its own tailpipe greenhouse gas emission standards. On Friday, California and 23 other states filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge the move.
When the Trump administration announced it would roll back Obama-era fuel efficiency standards in 2018, 17 states—including California—sued the EPA. Then, this year in July, California brokered a deal with four automobile companies—Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, and BMW of North America—to make cars that would average nearly 50 miles per gallon by 2026, just one year later than the target the Obama administration set. That was quickly followed by an attack by the Trump administration. As I wrote Tuesday:
The goal of the recent revocation, according to the Trump administration, is to have only one rule for automakers to follow in the US.
“One national standard provides much-needed regulatory certainty for the automotive industry,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement Thursday. The move was immediately challenged by California, and the state followed up by announcing the lawsuit today. “Two courts have already upheld California’s emissions standards…Yet, the Administration insists on attacking the authority of California and other states to tackle air pollution and protect public health,” California’s attorney general Xavier Becerra said in a statement. But even though the administration promises more “certainty” for automakers through having one rule to follow, legal experts say the move actually leads to more uncertainty around fuel efficiency standards.
Even during the early years of the Clean Air Act, which was initially established in 1970— but had major revisions in 1977 and 1990—there have been two standards for vehicle emissions: the national standard and the California standard. The Clean Air Act was in fact designed to allow a state like California to apply for a waiver to adopt stricter standards than those proposed by the federal government. Once the EPA granted California the waiver to have stricter standards than the federal government, 13 states and the District of Columbia followed California’s lead. After all, states have different levels of pollution and thus, different needs when it comes to emission regulations.
“The rhetoric you’re hearing from the administration is ‘one standard, one standard, one standard,'” says University of San Francisco law professor Alice Kaswan. “But with the Clean Air Act, we’ve always had two standards for the last 40 or 50 years. The automakers appear to have survived that.”
At a time when the market is demanding more fuel efficient cars, the Trump administration’s action to revoke California’s authority to have its own standard while pursuing a more lax federal standard helps neither the environment nor the auto industry.
“One thing that we’ve been over the course of developments on this is automakers aren’t asking for this either,” says UCLA law professor Julia E. Stein. “They’re concerned about regulatory uncertainty.”
The legal battle is likely to be protracted, but if the EPA’s revocation succeeds, the 13 states that follow California’s standard would have a harder time meeting their air pollution reduction goals because they would no longer be able to adopt California’s rules. Instead they would be forced to comply with standards that are less rigorous. That’s why Stein says the Trump administration’s action is also “bad policy” for public health.
The main reason California implemented the stricter standards for vehicle emissions was because of its smog pollution problem. “Historically, under the Clean Air Act, smog pollution is exactly the kind of pollution that has been recognized as a compelling and extraordinary circumstance” to grant a waiver Stein says. “And there is no reason to think that’s changed because as the administration itself pointed out, California still struggles to get its air pollution under control.”
The EPA’s statement announcing the revocation of California’s waiver concludes: “The state must redouble its efforts to address the worst air quality in the United States…where for decades it has failed to address serious, severe, and extreme non-compliance status in several areas within the state.” If the Trump administration’s revocation succeeds in the court battles to come, California will have lost one important strategy for achieving that goal.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

To Kill the Asylum System.,Noah Lanard,MotherJones,Politics,"On Friday morning, the Department of Homeland Security tweeted a message featuring a gif of Kermit the Frog banging away at a typewriter, accompanied by the text, “DHS beat reporters are gonna be busy today.” The big news is that the United States has reached a deal that could allow it to return asylum seekers stopped at the border to El Salvador, one of the world’s most violent countries.
The use of a Kermit gif to preview yet another potential abandonment of America’s commitment to protecting people fleeing persecution is only slightly surprising at this point. Over the past year, the Trump administration has waged an unprecedented campaign to dismantle the US asylum system. After a long string of defeats in court, it has celebrated recent victories with the unrestrained glee of a sports fan whose team is pulling off an upset. The fact that people may die because of its wins goes unstated.
It is still unclear if and when the United States would force people stopped at the border to seek asylum in El Salvador. At a press conference on Friday, Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said that was “one potential use” of the agreement but did not offer a timeline for when that might happen. In July, the United States reached a similar deal with Guatemala. McAleenan said in late July that he expected the United States to start sending asylum seekers to Guatemala in August, but that still isn’t happening.
The goal of sending back asylum seekers who pass through El Salvador would not be to strengthen protections, but to make the idea of seeking asylum in the United States so unappealing that fewer people will even try. More than 80,000 Salavadorans, many of whom are fleeing gangs like MS-13, have been stopped at the US-Mexico border this fiscal year. The country’s murder rate has declined sharply in recent years, but still remains among the world’s highest. In 2018, the country’s murder rate was 51 per 100,000 people, roughly 10 times higher than in the United States.
Imagine being a Nicaraguan escaping President Daniel Ortega’s oppressive regime. You know the United States is far safer and offers better opportunities for a new life. So you make your way up through Central America and Mexico—risking your life along the way—to ask for asylum at the US-Mexico border.
Once at the border, you’re told you’ll have to wait for weeks or months in dangerous border cities thanks to the Trump administration’s practice of capping the number of people who can request protection each day. Once you’re done waiting, you might be sent back to Mexico while your case is pending, since the Trump administration has now forced nearly 50,000 asylum seekers to stay south of the border while awaiting adjudication. Or, under the new agreement, you could potentially be sent back to El Salvador after all those months of hardship.
Would you try for asylum in the United States knowing all that? Probably not. That is exactly what the Trump administration is banking on. The goal is to minimize the number of people who see the United States as a viable safe haven.
How exactly the new agreement would work is hazy. Would asylum seekers from Africa and Asia who pass through Latin American on their way to the border be returned to a country where they don’t speak the language? Or, like the deal reached with Guatemala in July, would only other Latin Americans be sent to El Salvador?
What, if anything, El Salvador is getting in return is another question. The country reportedly wanted the Trump administration to reconsider its move to end temporary protected status for Salvadorans, a protection that allows nearly 200,000 Salvadorans already in the United States to remain there due to the danger back home. The administration refused to negotiate on that point.
At the press conference, Salvadoran Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill did not do much to dispel the notion that asylum seekers from other nations wouldn’t be safe in her country. “We are working every single day to try to solve this issue of people who by various reasons—reasons of insecurity or reasons of death threats—are forced to leave our country,” she said in English before adding, “El Salvador has not been able to give our people enough security or opportunities so that they can stay and thrive in El Salvador.”
Hill moved on to a point that is rarely made by the government with which she’d just signed an agreement. “When we talk about illegal or forced migration, sometimes we lose the concept that they are human beings,” she said. “These are human beings that are suffering. Human beings that are trying to find a better future for them and their children.”",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

They Just Wrote Congress Demanding Action.,Leah Douglas,MotherJones,Food,"A coalition that unites farmers and ranchers behind the Green New Deal hopes to set a new tone for how the agriculture sector relates to policy solutions to address the climate crisis and ensure farmers have a voice in the debate.
Farmers and Ranchers for the Green New Deal (GND) officially launched on Wednesday with a press conference at the Capitol and a letter to Congress urging members to support the GND resolution.
Leaders of the coalition say it represents nearly 10,000 farmers and ranchers who want to be part of the conversation as Congress considers how and whether to move forward with the GND. Farmers from across the country spoke at the press conference, as did a member of Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate action group, and several members of Congress.
A major theme of the press conference was the essential role of farmers in addressing the climate crisis. Agricultural and land use practices have been identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as major contributors to climate change. And climate-friendly strategies like sequestering carbon in the soil and expanding the use of regenerative farming practices require buy-in from farming communities.
“We’re not going to solve the climate crisis without addressing agriculture,” said Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal resolution and a longtime advocate for local and sustainable food.
Speakers also noted the urgent challenge farmers face as the effects of climate change—such as rising temperatures, drought, irregular and severe storms, and flooding—become more commonplace.
“The debate about whether or not to act on the climate crisis should have ended a long time ago,” said Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts. “Our farmers are the ones who live every day with the impacts of the crisis. …Our farmers should be the ones who get to have a say in our future, not the people who want to maintain the disastrous status quo.”
The Green New Deal resolution calls for a 10-year mobilization to transition away from reliance on fossil fuels and boost the economy by creating jobs in clean energy and other climate-friendly sectors. The resolution was introduced in the House in February by New York City Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and now has 95 co-sponsors.
At first, the GND didn’t win farmers over. A rocky rollout led to the perception that the resolution cast farmers as part of the climate change problem rather than potential allies in finding solutions. In March, the National Farmers Union voted not to endorse the GND because “the resolution appeals to an urban voter base and does not recognize the essential contribution of rural America.”
The leaders of the Farmers and Ranchers coalition said they’ve had to overcome some farmers’ reservations about the GND but that many are beginning to change their minds.
Will Harris, a rancher from Bluffton, Georgia, who runs White Oak Pastures, a regenerative and grass-fed livestock farm, and is co-chair of the Farmers and Ranchers coalition, said that as a middle-of-the-road voter he isn’t the typical supporter of aggressive climate policies. But he and others like him see the importance of farmers’ role as environmental stewards.
“I’m not a policy wonk,” he said in an interview. “I hope that my contribution would be that … very moderate people [take an] interest in this.”
The Farmers and Ranchers coalition supports policies that encourage carbon sequestration, enhance access to local food, build local food systems, and provide safe conditions for farmworkers. Some of its specific goals include fair prices for farm products, breaking up agribusiness monopolies, supporting beginning and diverse farmers and ranchers, and strengthening support for farmers transitioning to organic and regenerative practices.
A wide range of farmers and farming organizations contributed to drafting the coalition’s policy goals. Leah Penniman, co-director and program manager at Soul Fire Farm in Grafton, New York, said in an email that participating in drafting the platform “represented an important moment in terms of integrating social and environmental priorities into a cohesive vision for the future of farming.”
Penniman notes that any Green New Deal incentives and programs must “reach those who have been historically excluded from government programs, like Black farmers and indigenous people.” The coalition’s goals include several specific steps toward enhancing support for Native American, black, and other marginalized farmers and farmworkers, including reparation for dispossessed land, a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers, and an expansion of outreach programs by the Department of Agriculture.
Getting farmers and ranchers behind the Green New Deal could be essential to achieving the resolution’s major proposals, such as reaching net zero carbon emissions in the United States by 2030. Ronnie Cummins, international director of Regeneration International, which co-organized the Farmers and Ranchers coalition alongside Sunrise Movement, says that goal simply isn’t possible without farmers.
“You can’t possibly reach the goal of net zero emissions by 2030 from just reducing fossil fuel use,” he said. Yet the country could cut “fossil fuel use by 50 to 60 percent and then [sequester] the remainder” by enlisting farmers, he said.
Supporters of the GND, including farmers and ranchers, still have an uphill battle to turn the framework into policies and to get those policies passed. But at the press conference, its supporters expressed determination to keep the conversation going.
“Family farms like mine have lost so many things that we can’t get back,” said Garrett Blad from Sunrise Movement, who grew up on a farm in Indiana. He spoke of the “stranglehold” agribusiness has on farmers and the already encroaching damage of climate change. But, he said, “there is still something worth fighting for.”
When asked about the dismissal of the Green New Deal by trade associations and other agribusiness interests, Sherri Dugger, an Indiana farmer, executive director of the Indiana Farmers Union and Women, Food, and Agriculture Network, and co-chair of the coalition, said she doesn’t care about the “mockery” from powerful agriculture groups. “This is an important conversation that we have to have at a policy level, at an organizational level, at a societal level, and at an individual level,” she said. “This is serious stuff.”

	Politics","A judge on Wednesday issued a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of South Dakota’s new “riot-boosting” law, which passed earlier this year to deter pipeline protests. The law threatens heavy penalties for any person or group that encourages a “riot,” which is defined broadly enough to include many forms of public protest.
US District Judge Lawrence Piersol granted the injunction in response to a motion filed by the ACLU, which is representing four organizations and two Indigenous individuals in a suit alleging that the law is unconstitutional for its troubling vagueness and “chilling effect” on free speech. The Sierra Club, one of the organizations challenging the law, said that it would make the group “hesitant” to challenge the Keystone XL pipeline through protected forms of speech like rallies and online campaigns due to the risk of costly fines—up to three times the cost of any damages incurred by a related protest.
South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem drafted the law in consultation with police and TC Energy, the company behind Keystone XL. Construction of the pipeline, which would run through South Dakota, is slated to begin next year.
As I wrote in June, the South Dakota law is part of a wave of anti-protest measures that have recently been passed in more than a dozen US states:
Last week, a group of Greenpeace activists became the first people charged under a similar law in Texas, enacted in June, which makes it a felony to obstruct “critical infrastructure” such as oil and gas facilities. Thirty-one activists were arrested last Thursday after 11 of them dangled from a bridge to block boat traffic through the Houston Shipping Channel, the country’s largest oil export route.
In addition to the nine states that have already passed such a law, statutes criminalizing oil and gas protests specifically are currently pending in Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin. As Teen Vogue recently reported, Texas and Georgia recently passed laws that create new penalties for protesters on college campuses. Four other states are considering similar measures.

After all, vaping is a lot better for you than smoking cigarettes:
There’s no question that vaping is less harmful than cigarette smoking. No one debates that. It’s also true that vaping can help smokers quit cigarettes. No one debates that either.
As usual, though, the question is: how much? No one can tell you for sure, but here’s a chart that provides a hint:
Cigarette smoking has been steadily declining in the US since the ’60s. Vaping products started to take off in the US in 2013 and have increased their popularity every year since then. So if vaping were really making a serious dent in cigarette smoking, you’d expect to see the trendline for smoking bend downward starting a few years ago.
But you don’t. That doesn’t mean vaping has had no effect on adult cigarette smoking, but it does mean that the effect has probably been tiny at best. Now compare that to the rise in teen vaping:
For many years the big question about vaping was its net health impact. On the one hand, it helps smokers quit cigarettes. On the other hand, it gets teens hooked on nicotine. The net impact depends on which effect is bigger.
There’s no serious question about that anymore: vaping overwhelmingly acts as a way of getting teens addicted to nicotine and has only a tiny impact on cigarette smoking. This doesn’t automatically mean that vaping should be outlawed, but it’s the factual background for making a decision about what to do. If it were up to me, I’d make vaping capsules available via prescription only. That’s unquestionably a smallish inconvenience for some, but worth it if it stops the huge rise in teens developing lifelong nicotine addictions for the benefit of corporate profits.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

That’s the question rattling Washington this morning after an explosive report late Wednesday in the Washington Post detailed a whistleblower’s claim that the president made an alarming offer to a yet-unknown foreign leader that prompted a US intelligence official to file a formal complaint with the inspector general.
The revelation isn’t exactly extraordinary for this president. Trump did, after all, kick off his presidency by disclosing highly classified information to the Russians while chatting in the Oval Office. Last month, he shared what appeared to be a sensitive satellite image on his Twitter account. In between, the president has repeatedly sidelined the intelligence community in favor of foreign interests.
But who’s keeping track? On Wednesday morning, Trump blasted “anybody dumb enough to believe” he’d make such disturbing commitments to a foreign leader. In denying the Post’s report, Trump appeared to assert that he would not have acted inappropriately while others were listening.

Meanwhile, in a closed-door briefing Thursday morning, Trump’s handpicked inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, refused to disclose to lawmakers information on the whistleblower’s complaint—a standoff that once again has Democrats demanding to know whether the administration is covering up on behalf of the president.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

DC statehood might violate the Constitution, they claimed. DC wouldn’t be able to support itself financially, they worried. But Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) had a novel concern: Adding a 51st state might make it harder for his staff to park their cars.
Like other Republicans on the House committee that oversees DC, Massie suggested that the continued disenfranchisement of the district’s 700,000 residents was necessary because a hypothetical new state might exert undue pressure on the federal government. To illustrate his point, Massie called attention to the proposed map for the state of DC that would be established by HR 51, a bill introduced by DC’s non-voting delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton. Under the bill, a small enclave—essentially the National Mall, the White House, the Capitol, and various government buildings—would remain under federal control. According to Massie, the size of this enclave would somehow enable the DC government, which would likely be dominated by Democrats, to “influence” Hill staffers through its control of parking spaces.
“What strikes me is how small this enclave is proposed to be,” Massie said to Kenneth Thomas, an attorney with the Congressional Research Service, who was testifying about legal issues related to statehood. “Where do you park?”
“I take the Metro,” Thomas responded to laughter.
Undaunted, Massie continued. “Some of my staff actually park out where the new state would be,” he said, grinning. “So, what’s proposed…a lot of Capitol Hill staff would be parking outside of the federal enclave. Doesn’t it seem like there would be some influence if the congressional staff had to appeal to the new state to park?”
“I agree that if there’s a parking issue, that certainly could impact some staff members,” Thomas said.
Massie wasn’t done. “This is the ridiculousness you get into when you try to draw a federal city into a teacup,” he said. “The police that would be in this federal city can’t even park there. The workers can’t even park there.” Massie provided no explanation of why parking in DC would be any more difficult under Norton’s bill.

Stacey Plaskett, the Virgin Islands’ House delegate, later expressed incredulousness that concerns about parking could be more important than the voting rights of 700,000 residents. “That’s flabbergasting to me,” she said.
Massie’s complaint wasn’t the only far-fetched argument against statehood made by Republicans Thursday. At the start of the hearing, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) moved to subpoena embattled DC Councilmember Jack Evans, who is currently under federal investigation over allegations that he used his government positions to court clients for his consulting firm. Jordan suggested that DC’s history of political corruption means it isn’t fit to be a state.
Norton, who ran the hearing in place of committee chair Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), fired back at Jordan, reminding him that his own state has a rich history of political scandals. “But no one is suggesting that Ohio ought to lose its status,” she said.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

The North American bird population has declined by 3 billion, or 27 percent, since 1970, according to an extensive study published Thursday in Science. The authors of the study used population data from bird-watchers and biomass data from weather radars to calculate the decline. A majority of the 529 bird species studied experienced population loss, even species we tend to think of as abundant, such as warblers and blackbirds.
“We were stunned by the result—it’s just staggering,” Kenneth V. Rosenberg, a conservation scientist at Cornell University and the lead author of the survey, told the New York Times.
In addition to habitat loss, birds are suffering from the widespread use of pesticides, which kills the insects they eat. The study warns that the loss of birds could threaten ecosystems that depend on them as pollinators, predators, and prey, as the Washington Post explains.
Still, the populations of some species, like ducks and geese, are increasing thanks to conservation efforts. Other species, like vireos—small, grayish migratory songbirds that live throughout North America—are increasing as well, though scientists aren’t exactly sure why. The study was designed to quantify bird populations, but not to explain the factors affecting them.
Rosenberg told the Post that decreased pesticide use through sustainable agriculture is one thing that could help restore bird populations.",200,2019-11-13T03:12:31.151252Z

	Politics","
Editor’s Note: This piece was first published on the 10th anniversary of 9/11. As we commemorate the anniversary of the attacks that changed so much about our world, this story about what remained unchanged—politics—is as relevant as ever.
It changed everything.
That’s the mantra that emerged from the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001. In certain areas of our collective lives, it was an accurate description. Security concerns increased. The United States went to war in two far-away lands. It engaged in brutal practices that amounted to torture and opened secret prisons and the ever-controversial Guantanamo facility. Ugly barriers went up around public facilities. Navigating airports became a new kind of nightmare.
Also see our table of laws that have changed in reaction to 9/11.
But as the dust was settling, commentators and pundits also applied the changed-everything observation to other aspects of our society. Americans would become more united as citizens and more engaged with the world beyond their national borders. (Students did flock to Arab studies programs; CIA recruitment soared.) Our national discourse would become more serious—and such obsessions as shark attacks and the tragic disappearance of Capitol Hill intern Chandra Levy (the big stories during the summer of 2001) would be supplanted by more significant and important fare. Our politicians would devote more effort to advancing common interests rather than accruing political gain. We would all be better versions of ourselves.
For a time, some of that happened—on both mundane and more notable levels. Americans, anecdotal evidence indicated, became a bit more contemplative about their lives and priorities. In the weeks after 9/11, people were more courteous drivers (at least in Washington, DC). They gave other motorists more room and yielded more readily. The media produced stories about America’s place in the world; they explored the simplistic question, “Why do they hate us?” And the politicians did seem to ponder how to govern in a less divisive manner. President George W. Bush’s approval ratings skyrocketed, as Americans of various political bents, including those who had previously scorned the chad-enabled commander-in-chief, rallied around him.
But life often reverts to form, and change is fleeting and not necessarily a guarantee of progress. At some point, the old driving behaviors returned. Americans never did become very well informed about foreign affairs. A political culture of division and spin resumed. And these were all connected—well, maybe not the driving.
This week, the University of Maryland released a 9/11-related poll showing that many Americans remain ignorant about the link between 9/11 and the war Bush and Dick Cheney launched in Iraq. Nearly half of the respondents noted that Iraq was “directly involved” in the 9/11 assaults (15 percent) or gave “substantial support” to Al Qaeda without participating in those attacks (31 percent.). Neither is true. Iraq, as the 9/11 Commission reported, had not been in league with Al Qaeda. It had not provided “substantial” assistance—or any aid of note, for that matter—to Osama bin Laden and his mass-murderers.
The same poll also found that about half of Americans (47 percent) believe that prior to the Iraq war, the regime possessed actual weapons of mass destruction or had a major WMD program under way. Again, not true.
Obviously, the trauma of 9/11 did not cause Americans to become knowledgeable about the United States’ most significant overseas endeavor. But one reason for the widespread misbelief is that the political leaders of the country, in the aftermath of the attacks, soon resorted to the usual tactics to manipulate the public discourse, rather than elevate it.
Bush and Cheney notoriously misrepresented the WMD case for war to gin up popular support for the invasion. Afterward, they insisted for years—including in their recent memoirs—that they had not hyped the evidence. But prior to the invasion, they repeated falsehoods and exaggerated flimsy intelligence, and after they were proven wrong they dismissed the significance of their misleading assertions. And while greasing the way to war, both men also had insinuated that Saddam Hussein was in cahoots with Al Qaeda, when no intelligence backed up this emotion-stirring charge. In the years since, neither has confessed to leading the public astray on that front.
Even though case-closing facts emerged to show that Bush and Cheney had distorted information to move the nation toward war, their actions appear to have indelibly shaped the false perceptions still held by about half the public. The shock of 9/11 did not cause Americans to be more discerning.
Moreover, the Bush administration did not refrain from exploiting 9/11 in the most direct political sense. Within months of the attacks, it was back to business as usual. In January 2002, Karl Rove suggested that Republicans should point out that Democrats would not protect Americans as well as GOPers in the so-called war on terror. Later that year, a private Rove PowerPoint included advice to candidates that they “focus on the war” in their campaigns. That September, as Congress was in the final stretch of the midterm congressional elections, Bush insisted that it quickly consider legislation permitting him to launch the Iraq war, guaranteeing that the run-up to the elections would be dominated by Iraq, not his tax cuts for the wealthy, the environment, health care, or anything else that Democratic candidates wanted to talk about.
Two years later, the keynote speaker at the Republican convention, Sen. Zell Miller, an archly conservative Democrat supporting Bush, accused the Democrats of caring more about “partisan politics than national security” and making the nation “weaker.” He added that Democrats “don’t believe there is any real danger in the world.” He absurdly charged that Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, “would let Paris decide when America needs defending.” This was an unprincipled swipe at the patriotism of an entire party. At the time, Slate‘s Will Saletan wrote:
Miller’s fear-mongering and dishonest speech, vetted by Bush’s political team, was the epitome of the Bush-Rove (or Rove-Bush) effort to politicize 9/11 and the subsequent wars.
In the years since, politics certainly has not improved. The bitter and divisive assaults from the right on Barack Obama of the past several years—he’s a secret, foreign-born, socialist, anti-colonialist, Kenyan-like Muslim who pals around with terrorists and wants to destroy the economy through Obamacare in order to wipe out Americans’ freedom and wealth—are proof that the very brief post-9/11, let’s-get-along glow is long gone. Some conservatives might argue that the left’s Bush-is-a-treasonous-war-criminal rhetoric was an equivalent debasement of the national debate. But such talk was hardly embraced or enabled by leading Democrats. When the health care reform tussle raged in the House of Representatives in 2009, Republican leaders hosted a tea party rally, where angry demonstrators chanted “Nazis, Nazis,” referring to Democratic House members. This brought no rebuke from Reps. John Boehner or Eric Cantor, the top two GOPers (who each attended). The event did not even spark a major controversy. The harsh discourse of the Bush years had become harsher.
Anti-Bush partisans might be tempted to heap all the blame on W. for having perverted a national moment for his own benefit. At that time of tragedy, there did seem an opening to nudge—or at least try to nudge—the national political discourse in a more principled and honorable direction. He chose not to do so. But the culpability extends beyond the guy who happened (due to the unusual circumstances of a Florida election and the iffy reasoning of five Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices) to be in the Oval Office when Bin Laden attacked. If most Americans had demanded more of Bush, he might not have been able to sidestep this obligation so easily. September 11 was a missed opportunity for the entire nation. Within the political culture, we did not lift up the better angels of our nature.
